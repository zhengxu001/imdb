i'm a male, not given to women's movies, but this is really a well done special story. i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job, while deniro is his usual superb self. everything is so well done: acting, directing, visuals, settings, photography, casting. if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love - this is a winner.

sure, titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. the second time (and i am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, when is this d**n ship going to sink??? and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. the acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film, i mean who does he think he is, anthony hopkins or denzel washington? he does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. but enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. there is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! out of a possible 100% i give this film a mere 71%.

when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was. this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating. i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.the acting is superb. leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best. i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate. if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, this is the one. you will love all the acting, special effects, and much much more.if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now!!! you won't regret it.

why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather. titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great acting,directing,effects,music and generally everything. this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. there is nothing wrong with this movie. all i can say is that this movie, not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time, the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen. apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton. these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic.

what's inexplicable? firstly, the hatred towards this movie. it may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason. it's a damn good movie. which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters. i've rewatched it on tv and video, and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). but that might be it, the appeal of it. it's a movie, yes, capital m there, it's an epic, it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur. now, ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. not that titanic has none of that. well, the acting was actually very good. the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. this movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. the visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. i didn't cry when bambi's mom died, i don't react to tearjerkers. but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl. and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. and look at the top ten grossing films of all time. is a single one of them bad? is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? no, not even the phantom menace. and this movie made 1.8 billion dollars worldwide. it can't be bad. not possible. 10/10.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered.

previously, i wrote that i loved "titanic", cried at its ending (many times over), and i'm a guy in his 60's. i also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.well, i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. while 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating. these 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. in my previous comments, i blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for leonardo dicaprio. believe me, i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. they absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in "titanic". (to answer one other user: i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc. everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for "titanic", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of "titanic" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "heaven's gate" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1). "big top pee-wee" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). "cat people" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "blind date" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "jumpin' jack flash" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). what do all of these films have in common with "titanic"? all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower !!!! than "titanic", and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award. again, "titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned.can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor?

i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day. it was so touching and beautiful. i strongly recommend seeing for all. it's a movie to watch with your family by far.my mpaa rating: pg-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.

the movie titanic makes it much more then just a "night to remember." it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. why so criticised? i have no idea. could/will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. it will be almost impossible.the director no doubt had the major impact on the film. a simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. yes i'm not the romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. guaranteed! everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. everything looks very real and live. the legend herself "titanic" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. the acting was the real effect. dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. no one could have done better. they are partly the reason why the film is so great. i guess it's not too much to talk about. the plot is simple, the acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical, and a film to idolise for hollywood. could it get better? no. not at all. the most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. a landmark. (don't be surprised if you cry too)

i had few problems with this film, and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. true, it is over three hours long, but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly. i don't think it is overrated at all, i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent. the film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus. leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack, and kate winslet is lovely as rose. david warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. the story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. the last hour is extremely riveting, and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat, when the titanic sank. i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. the music score by james horner was lovely, though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on. the 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. overall, i give titanic an 8.5/10. bethany cox.

i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. anyway, everyone remembers the rms titanic. it was big, fast, and "unsinkable"... until april 1912. it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.so our two main characters are jack (leonardo dicaprio) and rose (kate winslet). they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). the main villain i guess is bad luck, fate, hand of god (no blasphemy intended), or just plain caledon hockley (billy zane). combine all of the above and what do you get?! oh yes! we get a love story on a sinking boat. the supporting characters are the following: my personal favorite, mr. andrews (victor garber)(idk he was so nice), lovejoy(david warner), murdoch(ewan stewart), lightoller (jonathan phillips), captain smith(bernard hill), molly brown(kathy bates), and many more. we also got the present day treasure hunter, brock lovett (bill paxton). they add something to the story, something good. the action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. the story is simple and it works. a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic. two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. i give titanic, an 86% awesome

titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. writer/director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic. the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet. they make for a good on-screen couple. dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane, kathy bates, frances fisher, jonathan hyde, and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. the love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg. overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.

the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! director, james cameron, from 'the terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. one of my favorite scenes is 'the dinner table' scene, in which rose's family and friends meet jack after he saves her. rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'the one'...i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband.jack and rose have a connection that is 'movie stuff' but it's good movie stuff. we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her. i really liked the hanging over the boat scene. it was a good risk.the movie is long but it's fantastic!!! good story, good flow, good actors!!! go see it twice if you want, its worth it!!!

titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. it has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic, i suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, you don't?" i know so many people who don't like this movie, and i'm not saying i don't see why. "the love story is too cheesy" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? all right, the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. but this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint, dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors. well, ok, in this movie, i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. but the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.and finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this is a good movie.well deserving of its oscars, in particular, best cinematography, which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy.i know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.i give this movie 10/10, not because i like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.

titanic is a classic. i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the imdb user rankings. maybe, it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to. and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose. whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. they barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. they trusted each other. they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money. "i'll never let go, jack." titanic is a great film down to it's very core. it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.

for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. no exceptions. james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. through films such as aliens, the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose (gloria stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone, no one else. emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. the music has become iconic and legendary. it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. only one problem, the usual james cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. my heart won't go on from this one.

back in 1997, do i remember that year: clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of princess diana, the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. this was also the big year in the release of titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, i was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful. at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong, of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14, a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now. was it worth the hype? was it really the best movie of all time? was that leonardo's real nose? ok, i know that's silly to say, but i did re-watch the film. being completely honest here, titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie, but titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean. unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude, wearing the heart of the ocean, dated the day the titanic sank. 101-year-old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. she and her granddaughter elizabeth "lizzy" calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic, revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater. in 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old rose boards the ship with her fiancé, cal hockley and her mother, ruth dewitt bukater, both of whom stress the importance of rose's engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts: while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class, rose and her mother are financially broke. distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage, rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. before she leaps, a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes. jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance, music and beer in third-class. but after cal's servant informs him of rose's whereabouts', rose is forbidden from seeing jack again. however, after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a "proper lady" at tea, rose defies him and her mother, asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean, an engagement present from cal. after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship.they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. after overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is, rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal. meanwhile, cal discovers rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe, so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack's pocket. upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck, rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. jack and rose return to the top deck. cal and jack, though enemies, both want rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. but after realizing that she cannot leave jack, rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship's first class staircase. jack and rose return to the top deck, the lifeboats have gone, and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down.so does titanic live up to it's hype? i still say that this is a great movie to watch, i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. but it has great acting, amazing effects, a well-written story and still looks flawless. love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. but all that aside, i do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10

titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic. the plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. kate winslett is wonderful as rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal (billy zane). early on the voyage rose meets jack (leonardo dicaprio), a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game. if he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes.the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the titanic, which has recently occurred. one of the survivors of the titanic, rose dewitt bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic. with this, the scene shifts to southhampton, ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york. historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, jack dawson. captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned. smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed. the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. on april 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help. the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own. the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. also, the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle. overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic.many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. the core group of rose, jack, cal, and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown; captain edward smith; the ship designer, thomas andrew; the white star line representative, bruce ismay; and all of the titanic's officers were real. the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk. the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown. as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations. in addition, officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss'. not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs. strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic. furthermore, mr. goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. the richest man on the ship, john jacob astor, who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. in addition, molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water. her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. the gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of 1912. the rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do. the rich did not take well to `new money' such as molly brown as depicted. everything of the time was very formal. women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie. men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken. the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. the director, james cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night. in addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic. only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored. this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. however, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed. as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.technically the film is very well done. to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. in addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage. this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.

i find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it. i personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! i guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. as for those that think that this film is "overrated" or "over-hyped"...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* you see, it's not critics/article writers that make a film "huge" or a "hit" with the general movie-going public. people make the film a huge success. with titanic, everyone was in awe. let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912. even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! give this movie a break you guys! the critics thought this movie would sink big time! when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth (which is the best form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! so, i really wouldn't say that this movie was "overhyped"...at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being "overhyped". ha! critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. however, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more! personally, i love this film. however, this film might not be for everyone. don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard! disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! the story was sweet. the dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate...it was that gigantic ship! i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job. it's not thier best work (i've seen much better work from both of them) but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before. give them a break!

i avoided watching this film for the longest time. long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz, and i wanted nothing to do with it. i never watched it in the theatre. i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards - even though i had never seen it. then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. one of the girls spoke about this movie. "it was so great," she said. "you really felt like you were on the ship." "nonsense," i thought. i shared my feelings with my fellow judges. one looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic. the movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "well, maybe," thought i. then it finally appeared on pay tv. "ok," i thought, "i'll give it a look see." i didn't want to like it - and i didn't. i loved it! what a great movie.where to start? first - the directing. my high school public speaking contestant was right. james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. you don't just watch it; you really do feel it. then - the performances. the lead performances from kate winslet (as rose) and leonardo dicaprio (as jack) are excellent - winslet's being the superior, i thought, but both were good. they had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" i thought. in my opinion, though, stealing the show was frances fisher as rose's mother. she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack. then - the details. i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic, but i have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. very impressive, indeed. then - the song. who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion's performance of "my heart goes on."problems. well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (i know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, i thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. a minor quibble, though. this is truly an excellent movie. my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where i think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10

to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? if you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. it was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. it is the most amazing love story ever attempted. i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! how lame is that? it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. i will gladly side with the majority this time around. okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, i am done.

every once in a while the conversation will turn to "favorite movies." i'll mention titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. and they're too embarrassed now to admit it.i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time. expecting to simply enjoy the story again, i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. i cried again.... in all the same places. it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall (yes, even more than star wars). and today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. you look like an out of touch cynic.no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. however, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful. leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. kate winslet was so strong in this film. the movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic. the sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. i was utterly transfixed.this film is one memorable scene after another. titanic leaving port in southampton. rose and jack at the bow, "flying". "iceberg, right ahead!" the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. the screams of the doomed after she went down. and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.the music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. james horner's score was simply perfect. and the love theme was beautiful and tragic. too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.i confess, i am a titanic buff. as such, i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life. however, i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs. i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. the film was made with such humanity.another reviewer said it better than i ever could: open up your hearts to titanic, and you will not be disappointed.

i am not a parent, neither am i a male. but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.this is a movie teenagers should watch. maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing. and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. he showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama. he should be offered more serious roles. note hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006.this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but i recommend it to the entire family.i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times. because it portrays the values that are important in life.

daniell steel's daddy, what a refreshing story. this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. how rare is that? in these times of "heather has two mommies" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga. how disappointing to have it end. every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role. i would have loved to see each character develop over the years. i loved this movie, it is one i will defiantly watch every time it's on. good story, good acting, and i hope this isn't a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language. yes it touched my heart. warning, get the kleenex ready. what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it television or. movie's. daniell if your listening, you go girl, give us more.

family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. one man, daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. the kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. yes, i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. this true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. a must see for those who care about their families.

it's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males. in this one the wife/mother leaves her family to "get in touch" with herself - or pursue her libido. the father stays with and nurtures the kids, letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.

i must admit, when i read the description of the genre on netflix as "steamy romance" i was a little bit skeptical. "steamy"? in a movie from 1968?? i was prepared for disappointment. and when i realized it was shot entirely in black & white, i knew my erotic hopes were dashed.boy, was i wrong! not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. you will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. and the performances from the two stars (essy persson and anna gael) are intense and memorable. ok, so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. it's 1968. do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.i think this movie was way ahead of its time. the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: although it won't be all you expect, i don't think you'll be too, too disappointed.

this is a film.., not porn.this is a wonderful film!!! full of tender moments and memories!! a beautiful piece of work!!! excellent!!! for intelligent, viewers only!!!if you are a film lover. a romantic. a person who has loved deeply, this is your film!!!!it has a beautiful surreal quality. fine acting and directing. watching this film made me remember my first love.thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.highly recommended for all film lovers.

it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocative therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl's school therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience the film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity... the imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly the director, radley metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas "therese and isabelle" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...

this was the beginning of it all! granted, this is not friends at its best, but this was the show's pilot, let's not forget and not a bad one at that. we're introduced to the gang and central perk, where our story begins. even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross-rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years, when ross says: 'i just want to be married again' and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on... probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica-joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back. something else.. in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes, the so-called 'flashbacks' this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions. nevertheless, the point is this a fine start to a great show. this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them, with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was! keep watching, first season is a blast!!

here it is.. the first ever episode of friends, where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar (courtney cox), newly divorced ross gellar (david schimmer), hippy pheobe buffay (lisa kudrow), unknown actor and ladies man (matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing (matthew perry). this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green (jennifer aniston).the episode is better than most people give credit for, like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic. the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters (apart from kudrow and perry- who shine).matt le blanc- man, his acting was down right dreadful because until later, he gets more confident, but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails.david schimmer- why does he over pronounce every word? he cannot speak normally! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident. and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston- looks hot, and does a good job as rachel green, but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season, courtney cox- looks quite anorexic in this episode, its worrying, she looks totally different now, (more healthily), she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! lisa kudrow and matthew perry- i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe (pheebs) and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically! the episode quality does improve later,,, such as the sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly, the acting is ok, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot! i hope we see the friends reunite! cause they will always be there for us!

and that's how the greatest comedy of tv started! it has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season. because that's where "friends" is based: on quotes. extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts: let's say a big thanks to rachel, ross, monica, joey, chandler and phoebe!!! in our first meet, we see how rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), monica's search for the "perfect guy" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. till we meet joey, phoebe and chandler in the next episodes... enjoy friends!

the pilot is extremely well done. it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes. i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part. although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. an example would be ross and rachels future relationship. even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.bravo.a great start to an unbeatable comedy!

in the very first episode of friends, which aired 22 sept 1994 "the one where monica gets a roommate" there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show, the line that plays is: "if you ever need holding".... does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song? it is seems as if it is a great song....i would love to get a copy of it. thanks for the assistance. i am looking for the album/cd it is on so i can purchase it. i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again. it just seemed to be believable...thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years.

in this first episode of friends, we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series: monica geller,phoebe buffay,chandler bing,ross geller, joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green .we discover that rachel, a rich girl that is monica's friend from high school times, left her fiancé, barry, at the altar, since she discovered she didn't love him. she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father,getting a new job as a waitress in central perk.ross, for the other hand,discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan, her partner. (we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode)monica, in this episode, makes out (and eventually sleeps) with paul "the wine guy", who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife. but in reality, he was just deceiving her.ps: i just loooove joey's and chandler's haircuts in this first season! =)

but the fun is in the journey.i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. but the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.the dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention! for those that panned it for being predictable - if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. this is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way.great date movie, great movie for a happy cry...

this is a really old fashion charming movie. the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies. fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it. the acting is good, and i really liked michael rispoli. he was in rounders, too. and while you were sleeping. the rest of the cast is fun. it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings. i know... sounds kooky... but it is. and that's what makes it fun to watch. it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you, but at least you'll know.

as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known. the two leads always have to get together. late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together. a clue was given right from the start, but you'll never realize it until the end. it's a simple hook, but it works. it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground, but takes a fresh spin when ever possible. i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations. it's a postcard of ny. also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it. so, if you like a good old fashion romantic movie ... then this is for you.

does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by george ede aka, father fitzpatrick in the move, it had to be you? he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving? if not i will have to rent the movie. this was a great movie. i also loved serendipity! great love story for the soul! i met my one true love (my soulmate) and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it, i wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. altho, we did marry, i wasn't mature enough to give as much as i thought i would. i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years. he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out. i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years.this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love. i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me.i know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will remarry.don't ever get complacent and take true love for granted! it has been the hardest lesson of my life. also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful! this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting. true love is worth waiting for, if it is meant to be, it will, no matter what, it will happen! nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around! thanks!

i'd have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a "lifetime" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, new york city. most on this channel, whether "set" there, in rural iowa, oregon, virginia, l.a. etc., are filmed in vancouver, ottawa, toronto or some other canadian locale.but if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site, it's this movie. certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. it's also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from cary grant, james garner, harrison ford, tom hanks, et al - and deborah kerr, doris day, meg ryan, and many more. i can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen. i caught it by chance on a mid-day friday, at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. and, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman (anna's mother) whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days, and michael rispoli (henry, charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as "gramma," the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from "rounders." the chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it enhances it).checking some other comments, i agree completely with those which are the most positive. the primary word describing this film is engaging, in caps. this adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.i love films with a "harder edge:" "rounders;" the escapist schwarzenegger/stallone fare; "goodfellows;" even the classics like "casablanca," "gone with the wind," "citizen kane." but for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. with a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by "you've got mail" and "sleepless in seattle." and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.

a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. the ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. maybe a little trite in that the "partners" are both type a personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. not anything heavy, but it made me smile. and hey for the guys - sell the natasha henstridge angle, and the gals - sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!

sure, this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés, but it's entertaining, and that's what i watch movies for. to be entertained. natasha henstridge is stunning, even with the short hair. her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised. as for michael vartan, i'm sure the women love him. the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film. i don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them. i guess we see what we want to see.olivia d'abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch, even if d'abo's british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech. to tell you the truth i hadn't really noticed it until i read these comments, but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me, but she was ideal for her role with that one exception. it's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others, but who find their soul mates in one another. it may be an unlikely story, but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries? it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube. that's why we watch them, to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen. i thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, i'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily. don't get me wrong though, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had plenty of those.i give it 9/10 only because i'm saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day. if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies, or whatever, make a note to watch it. i think you'll like it.

a beautiful postcard of new york. the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. it never did. my teenagers liked it too. my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan. my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something. this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done. the ending came with a twist which we all liked too. if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.

i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work. finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on lifetime movie channel.jim larson's comments about it being a "sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths" were dead on. writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else sro for making the movie.anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it.natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.god bless her, her family and future endeavors.this movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet, but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too.

i caught this film at a test screening. was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. well acted. natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts. the male lead was awsome. very funny film. takes place in the best locations in new york. made me want to go there. i just saw "you've got mail" i thought "it had to be you' was a much better story. fresher.it was clean and great for whole family. i think it will do well. audience i saw it with loved it. a definite recommend!

this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.he sure can and is likable in this movie.natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and lovable in this different"sweet" role of a schoolteacher. some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. however,i enjoyed this movie.the locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. if you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.

i just can't understand the negative comments about this film. yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by. henstridge (talk about winning the gene-pool lottery!) is as magnetic and alluring as ever (who says the golden age of cinema is dead?) and vartan holds his own.there is simmering chemistry between the two leads; the film is most alive when they share a scene - lots! it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together...ignore the negative comments - if you are feeling a bit blue, watch this flick, you will feel so much better. if you are already happy, then you will be euphoric.(ps: i am 33, male, from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess...)

i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b-rated movie. i came out surprised and very amused. eva was good, but lake bell stole the show. she had amazing comedic timing. the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between. the plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman (eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was-to-be husband, its sounds far-fetched but it actually works quite well. 7/10 - overall its a worthwhile cinema watch, if not get it on dvd when it comes out.

i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say, it was very, very good. on all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc. proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston, who mug and call it acting. who'da thunk it?parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as "over her dead body." lake bell is excellent, too, and this is the first time i have seen her. and finally, paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films.a movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males. it's too bad. as other imdb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting. and its depiction of contemporary l.a. and california, in general, makes every scene look bright, beautiful, clean, and otherwise outstanding in every way. never before has a movie made l.a. look so good. ah, what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie.i won't divulge the plot, but as a long-time and hard-core atheist, i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment. it reminds me very much of the old "topper" movies, which were also so enjoyable.this movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like "ghost" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are. we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre. some of us save our praise for the truly worthy, however.if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as "into the night" with michelle pfeiffer, jeff goldblum and clu gulager, "blind date" with bruce willis and kim basinger, "american dreamer" with jobeth williams, "chances are" with robert downey jr., christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard, "making mr. right" with john malkovich, etc., you'll enjoy this. a first-rate job all around (even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.) but even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence.

ah, i loved this movie. i think it had it all. it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times. yes, i am a girl, so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective. i think it's a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating. too many guys voting? it was far above other romantic comedies. just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks, on the contrary i prefer other genres. romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be. but like i said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion. great script, good one-liners, fine acting. although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives, but so what? it was awesome. i will keep this film for rainy days, days when i feel low and need a few laughs.

this had a good story...it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool.i've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two weeks.jason bigg's character was the best though.even though it was small, it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning.this may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most, but the writing, direction, performing, sound, design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool.this film scored pretty high out of all the movie's i've seen lately - and the rest were big budget or better publicized.good job in writing.

this is a great film.i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this. i had never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet mike from friends).but it is great! eva, lake and paul give amazing performances. the humour is consistently dry and witty.paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends (which works great). the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic (i mean we are not talking 'apocalypse now' here) but the characters are likable, the story is engaging, the soundtrack, production and direction all work well.in all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets.everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this.

actually my vote is a 7.5. anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... i think that not exactly but who cares? also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, chris rock appears in it, the name is down to earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr. rock won with his movie. i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher, however, the film is good.

i watched this on an 8 hour flight and (presumably because of the pressure and the altitude) i actually found it mildly entertaining (emphasis on the "mild").the actual idea behind the film was brilliant: a woman dies, her fiancé falls in love with someone else, she decided to make sure they don't get together, but eventually she lets them do it. sadly the actual film wasn't as good. ok, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on. i think the whole gay-but-not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better. the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest: it wasn't really very funny.in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was a close call.

i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short though (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace.overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating. hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright, it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.

look it's eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend. it's gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore "sex panther cologne" in anchorman. if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies. however, if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place. the characters are all funny. they work together very well. the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell. he's as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time. i went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did i.

over her dead body was a nice little movie.it was decent and entertaining, while still being pretty funny.there were a few cliché's, but i found most stuff fresh.at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all,when it started out.if you can get past the first 20 minutes though,the movie starts getting more interesting.this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious,and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i don't see how this movie was bad.it's rating is just a bit too low.i could've dealt with a 5.5,but a 4.8?also,giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.it was pretty good,and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1,which is what most people gave it.

in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly good! i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.however, after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. with only one 'toilet humour' gag, over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.the staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!

though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing' (spoorloos) it does have the same overall feel, except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric. the beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end. a surprise emotional ending. as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully. never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour. it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one. where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste. 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years. when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved. what can we ask more of a film? anyway, this film even gives more....

tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei', a novel that was put on the screen twice ('spoorloos' and 'the vanishing'). one of the dutch writer's more recent works is 'de grot', a psychological thriller about two totally different men, egon and axel, who meet at a youth camp and, surprising enough, become friends for dear life. egon is a quiet, somewhat dull person, who spends his time studying and writing geography books. axel, on the other hand, is a charismatic 'party-animal', a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom. from the moment they meet, axel has a strong influence on egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything (such as reading thick books like egon); ultimately, egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country.after having read the book last year, i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it. in my opinion, the book suffers especially from the complex structure. while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle: the many episodes are not presented chronologically, so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode. because of this, the story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her. another complaint was the fact that the main characters, egon and axel, are a little stereotypical. egon is 'the' dull intellectual, while axel is his exact opposite. in real life, such one-dimensional people rarely exist; in books and films, they always seem to be there, taking away a lot of credibility.despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book. the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography, humour and acting: fedja van huet (egon) is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting (which is, in my opinion, the highest an actor can achieve). the drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional, they are so predictable that it becomes annoying. guess who wrote the script? indeed, krabbe himself. it is obvious that this talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay. perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book.7/10

'de grot' is a terrific dutch thriller, based on the book written by tim krabbé. another of his books, 'het gouden ei' was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called 'spoorloos' ('the vanishing') in 1988. this one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the american remake also called 'the vanishing') but there are times it comes close.especially the opening moments are terrific. we see a man, later we learn his name is egon wagter (fedja van huêt), coming from a plane in thailand. when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border. these scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman, both stating that they have never done anything like this.from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. we see how egon, still as a child (here played by erik van der horst), befriends a guy named axel (as a kid played by benja bruijning). we learn how they grew up as friends, sort of, and how axel (as an adult played by marcel hensema) became a criminal. egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman. around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him.the movie is chronological in a way. it shows egon and axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. but from time to time, like i said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again. every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults.minor spoilers herein.the title means 'the cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. like the beginning, the ending is terrific. the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes, only to come back at that point in the end. it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well.

though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing' (spoorloos) it does have the same overall feel, except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric. the beginning is great, the middle is fine, but the sting is in the end. a surprise emotional ending. as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film, but it is done all very beautifully. never explicit, but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour. it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one. where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject, 'de grot' stays always within the boundaries of good taste. 'de grot' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years. when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved. what can we ask more of a film? anyway, this film even gives more....

de grot is a very good film. the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. some really top-class acting, not only by van huêt, but especially by marcel hensema, who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf. the film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood. then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats. make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie. a must-see, especially if you liked 'spoorloos' (the vanishing's original screen adaptation).

kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie! panaghoy sa suba is very good -- it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh.while the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, japanese occupation, rebellion, american as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the filipino, nipongo for the japanese and english for the american.this movie will go as one of this year's best pinoy movies.go watch this!

well it's been a long year and i'm down to reviewing the final film for 2004. panaghoy sa suba (call of the river) placed second in the recent metro manila film festival. as expected, it didn't do so well at the box office as it was too artsy for the common moviegoers especially since mmff is the season where a lot of families go out to see movies.it was quite intriguing to see a movie that was not in filipino or english play out in the screen. i thought cesar montano did a good job both as a star and director. his great vision and creativity really helped this film. he was also very effective as the lead star and was able to express a wide range of emotions that was required for the film. also performing well was young actress rebecca lusterio. she did a great job portraying bikay, the younger sister of duroy. i hope to see her in many more film projects in the future perhaps venturing into other genres. i think that the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her.some of the camera shots in the film were done very well. the scenery was made breathtaking even though i feel that if a lesser effort would have looked completely different.in terms of the story i feel that the writers could have delved further into the lives of the lesser characters in the film. i certainly won't be raving about the story of this film.

i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund visayan film understorey. "panaghoy" is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular (that claims more speakers than tagalog). the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines. downside: the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist. the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the "period" costume of the same character, and above all, his bright red kit-car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster. without those small yet glaring details, "panaghoy" would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating--daghang salamat, manoy cesar! addendum: this film sure beats peque gallaga's "oro, plata, mata", which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war. alos, there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's "the color purple" and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of "noli me tangere".

rented this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie, and one of my top three favorite of all time, i recommend it to everyone!the story is enjoyable and easy to follow, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together.the actors themselves are fantastic, displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job. gotta find a copy somewhere...........

in my years of attending film festivals, i have seen many little films like this that never get theatrical distribution, and they end up in the $3 bins at walmart. i just found dvd of yank tanks there, great doc, but how sad for it to end up as a rock-bottom remainder.i loved this film, wish i'd seen it at the cinema in it's everything. i'd have preferred that new yorker films had translated the title directly. it's good for americans to stretch a little. if the film's title helps the us audience to explore random chaos, all the better. cinema imitates life & visa versa.also, i found it distracting that the subtitles put prices in dollars. come on! the euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo audiences do the math. seeing a film, especially one shot in paris, the viewer should not have the effect spoiled by being reminded: i am an american watching a movie and they are translating the euros into dollars for me. looking forward to seeing more of these actors and more from the writer & director as well.

this film has renewed my interest in french cinema. the story is enchanting, the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful. i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie.

seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers. perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something? i'd watch it again if i had some incentive.so what's a happenstance? to the french it is "le battement d'ailes du papillon" serendipity? fate? perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings. we've all had these (it's called life) but when looked at in this way, you begin to get the feeling that "random" might be more like "fated."a 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble. all these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture? dominoes. multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen. and i think that there's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. but then this is the magic world of cinema.we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens. if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here's the place to do it. or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway, this will engage you while your stitches are healing. "happenstance" will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following. stranger things have happened. soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following: "life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward." if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last auto accident) you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it.that's the answer! i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain "happenstance" to me.

"happenstance" is the most new york-feeling parisian film i've seen since "when the cat's away (chacun cherche son chat). "a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for "amelie," its french title is more apt: "le battement d'ailes du papillon (the beating of the butterfly's wings)" as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives.tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures, and because she's part of a large, multi-ethnic ensemble, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn't sure if they were doing that or not. but i loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafés.the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.(originally written 12/8/2001)

this isn't exactly a great film, but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. the film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors, though instead of focusing on one random event, seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion. plus, an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene--like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film (like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy).the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou. this is capitalize on her success in amelie, though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role. the pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all. the only reason i didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots.

narratives  whether written, visual or poetic epics  generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. this is especially true in film, i think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. viewers like myself, however, don't have that problem because we see all our films on dvd or vhs.a year ago i was introduced to audrey tautou, a french actress, whom i first saw in the fabulous destiny of amelie poulain (2001) and later in a very long engagement (2004), both of which were finely crafted and complex stories with a large cast of characters. this earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity.now, other directors have used those techniques before: robert altman with the player (1992), short cuts (1993), gosford park (2001) and others; paul thomas anderson did the same with magnolia (1999). stanley kramer did it with a mad, mad, mad, mad world in 1963, a comedy of almost epic proportions. the difference with this film is, first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods.the basic  the core, so to speak  story concerns a young woman, irene (tautou) who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. this occurs in the first few minutes of the film. the clever irony at this point is that irene doesn't realize that the young man opposite (gilbert robin) may be that 'one true love'. and, nor does he...they go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. however, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the rest of the characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed and interwoven vignettes that all seem to be going nowhere, and yet...if the story were simply that, it could tend to be boring, and even quite predictable. not so. the script and the director rip into our expectations with a host of innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events that allow the two possible lovers to meet again. for example, the next time some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper of yours, consider your alternatives; two characters make an obvious choice that must occur before irene and her man of destiny meet again. or what about a stone chip flying onto your windscreen? consider again what would happen...all of that is interesting enough. what was more interesting for me was assessing each new man who came along and trying to decide whether this guy was the one for irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train. that kept me guessing for a while.i'll let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp.recommended for all.

this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen. perfect, beautiful, funny, simply wonderful.i found this movie delightful, even with it's french taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on. i loved it - it's a great love story. and i loved the way algerians were woven in - and by the way, the music during the final credits is great. i want the cd!

this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular "amelie", both having the wonderful audrey tautou playing the central role. laurent firode, the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory.the film deals with chance, as its english title indicates. the french title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the pacific, something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects. from the start, the director interlaces all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other, something that is hard to imagine, but in the film's context seems to work well.a chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film. irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper. irene, it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day. after irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene. it seems they are destined to one another from the start, but alas, they will not reconnect until the last frame of the film.audrey tautou is wonderful as irene. faudel, who plays younes, doesn't have a lot to do until the end, but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part. the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings.we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected.

to me, this review may contain spoilers, but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen, so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers!i just watched this movie again, and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie. ever. ever. ever. the real translation, 'the beating of the butterfly's wings', is oddly not used as the translated title. i suppose they thought most americans wouldn't know what chaos theory is (except for those who saw or read "jurassic park"). the movie is based on chaos theory, and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, which all lead back to one event. the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters (about 20?). in a way, the ending seems inevitable despite this, but if you think about it, it is a perfect ending. think to yourself, "what else needed to be said"? it is at the same time a very brave ending. too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one, but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood.

most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou's real life personality, hence, every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2, part 3, etc.now with that said, i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it. yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min, but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters. the guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss, actually.... getting into all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while.audrey tautou's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was. in fact, as irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first. in this film, irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a (very awful) day, her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic.what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building... very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters can actually act. the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.... this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms. i swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while, and the ending.... it made me think "damn i really lucked out finding this movie". the ending to this movie is top notch. whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are there all these other subplots going on, but to somehow make them all tie in together (and in a sensible manner, which is the case here) but also to make each character feel human and come alive, not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect... very impressive.i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.

the mystery here is why this delightful, small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves. simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti. lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations, itõs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and, unlike some of itsõ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre, such as the taste of others, it actually entertains.

the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific. according to this theory (somehow related to the chaos theory, i'm not sure exactly how), every action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly-unrelated characters, most of them in paris, whose actions will affect each others' lives. (the six-degrees-of-separation theory can be applied as well.) each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film. the acting is finely-tuned and nuanced (audrey tautou is luminous), the stories mesh plausibly, the humor is just right, and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement.

given the title, this first follow-up to quartet (1948) obviously reduces the number of w. somerset maugham stories which comprise the film. the author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there’s no epilogue this time around; by the way, while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r.c. sheriff, here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation, as well as noel langley (though it’s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). as can be expected, much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely naunton wayne, wilfrid hyde-white and felix aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “the colonel’s lady”). while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time), it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain.“the verger” tells of a church sexton (james hayter) – for which the story’s title is another word – who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (michael hordern) simply because he’s illiterate. rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by kathleen harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and, with business flourishing, this is developed into a whole chain. the last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! the second episode, “mr. know-all”, is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (nigel patrick), british despite his foreign-sounding name of kelada, who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde-white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick’s attentions to his pretty wife (anne crawford). during a fancy-dress party, however, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesn’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she’s wearing is an imitation, wayne challenges patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it’s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford’s position if he were to tell, so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! as can also be deduced from the title, “sanatorium” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre' morell; the protagonist is a new intern, roland culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on. the narrative, in fact, highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous (the ‘feud’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium, played by finlay currie and john laurie), one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which, in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘lifer’ while rennie only has a few years left to him, leads the couple to the altar).

the makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully. every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. i love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest shetland shawls. roland culver as ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it's raymond huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. he usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. the china seas (great 30s film starring gable and harlow) stole the plot from the mr know all episode (and also nicked a story by kipling). i wish we saw more of naunton wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a mexican hat. i love that posh bird who plays his wife, too.

trio's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable. it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young. the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.observation. in film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile. "small morality" storytelling is quaint (or coy) only in the eye of the beholder--thankfully. story content--well told--can overcome it's time, subject or place.ironically, there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era. inserting "small morality" content--occasionally--might provide a dimension lacking.

this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham's short tales. the first one is the verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he can't read nor write. so what does he do? opens a tobacco shop, of course!the second is mr. know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten, until i heard the familiar introduction. another 15 minute one, and also very good. it worked better on film than in a book for me, but then perhaps that's because i was only 14 the last time, afterall.the 3rd one is nearly a let-down. almost an hour in length, it simply drags. it's not all that bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour, and found that it still made sense and really i hadn't missed a thing!overall i give them 8, 9, and 6 out of 10, respectively.

made after quartet was, trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham. here the three stories are the verger, mr. know-it-all, and sanitorium. the first two are comic (the verger is like a prolonged joke, but one with a good pay-off), and the last more serious (as health issues are involved). again the author introduces the film and the stories.james hayter, soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick, is the hero in the verger. he holds this small custodial-type job in a church, but the new vicar (michael hordern) is an intellectual snob. when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him. hayter has saved some money, so he tells his wife (kathleen harrison) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop. he has a good eye, and his store thrives. soon he has a whole chain of stores. when his grandchild is christened by hordern, the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-verger. the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments. i'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting.according to maugham he met a man like max kelada (nigel patrick) on a cruise. in mr. know-it-all kelada is a splashy, friendly, and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip (regarding jewelry) by steamship. his state-room mate is mr. grey (the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde-white) who is somewhat, silently disapproving of max. max likes to enliven things, and soon is heavily involved in the ship's entertainment. at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-maugham story and film china seas (1935), as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake (after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real). i won't describe the way max rises to the occasion.sanitorium is the longest segment. roland culver plays "ashenden" (the fictional alter-ego of maugham - a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock's the secret agent). here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health. he finds a remarkable crew of people, including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman, finlay currie as an irascible scotsman, john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is "at war" with currie, raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up, and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness. culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions. the last, dealing with simmons and rennie, is ironic but deeply moving.it was a dandy follow-up to the earlier quartet, and well worth watching.

i like it because of my recent personal experience. especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their "real" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. this made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. the end was not quite important after all. you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. movies are supposed to be enjoyable. this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. i am on a journey too. the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.

jesse and celine (ethan hawke and julie delpy) are two strangers on a european train. the two come from widely different backgrounds, he's american and she's french, after they talk a bit on the train jesse manages to get celine to get off the train and explore vienna with him. during the next several hours the two wander vienna taking in all that the city has to offer and become madly infatuated with each other. but will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.this wonderful romantic-comedy is a breath of fresh air to a genre that has been in decline. written and directed by richard (dazed and confused) linklater, "before sunrise" never bores because of its' small cast. in fact it flourishes due to the leads that make you love their characters and have a wonderful charisma between the two. smart dialogue makes this a must for romance fans.

amazing movie that, in theory, should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding. instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. the lead characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you could know is easy. the movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance. i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel. a moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's. will soften even the hardiest heart.

i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good. i was stunned. easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life. stunning. brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.ethan hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple. the movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go. you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them. even the little moments just melt your heart. this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever. a masterpiece.

i bought the dvd of before sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. having saw it twice, i couldn't help but missing before sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but i felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time i finished watching one of them, i feel the need and yearning to see the other. so, i ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, i will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. the most remarkable thing about before sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. it sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, i think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in nora ephron - before sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. when i saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when i was 20, i already liked it. but, i didn't rate it as a "great film", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, i thought i liked it because it was like a dream and because i enjoyed their conversations, etc. etc.. but now, thanks to before sunset, i feel that's more to before sunrise than what i felt for it before. i saw the elements more clearly: jesse, celine, vienna, their conversations, everything. how each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, i am no longer feel manipulated. and the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind i was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when i first saw it! now, 8 year have passed, the more movies i've seen, the more i realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like pulp fiction or linklaters's own slackers included. the jesse and celine tale avoid that, maybe before sunset is a better example in this case, but before sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. i don't know whether linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made before sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. before sunrise which i think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding jesse and celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. meanwhile, i enter the vision of boredom as jesse stuck talking to the journalists in before sunset, and celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile i've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place i don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful paris is, and no matter how happy i am that they meet again. i'm sorry that i go on this long with my limited english, before sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it.

i'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of only a handful of movies ever made that i would consider romantic. to try to talk plot or performance or technical details about this film would be in the words of frank zappa "like dancing about architecture". it absolutely hits the nail right on the head in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us and then run away from us never to be experienced again. this seems like the movie the character version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write. the ending is left open and ambiguous, no happy ending here, just mystery. no profound life lessons, just a couple of horny and intelligent kids exploring the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic of feelings...... romantic love.10 out of 10 watch it with your special lady and recommend it to a stranger................

i must admit that at the beginning, i was sort of reticent about watching this movie. i thought it was this stupid, little, romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him. i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. still, i watched it! and i was amazed..."before sunrise" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales. the ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. the actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, i began to believe that i, myself could live a love-story just like this.

american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa. on the train he met a french girl celine. although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. when the train stopped at vienna, jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna. then the romantic story unfolded.at first they were cautious. the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store. they peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. after in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.love is a strange thing. when you really want it, it will not come as you wished. love needs mutual understanding. without it, love will not last long. spiritual harmony is the most important for love.excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.one of the best romance movies. 9/10

the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed. ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch. a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic(at least one of them) movie of all times.

my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together...which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships! as a lot has been written about the movie already, it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved.i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with...on the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish..i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer's and director's mind. what the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify... to become the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story...here both the actors do just the right job! kudos..!!!and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful!

i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of "before sunrise" (1995) and "before sunset" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. after sleeping it over, i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter, and i shall explain why.before sunrise introduces us with then young actors, ethan hawke (reality bites, dead poets society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and julie delpy (the three colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). he is a promiscuous american writer, touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; she is a young french student, on her way home to paris. they meet on the budapest-vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.the film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. the characters of jesse (hawke) and celine (delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half american-half french, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.all in all, sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.

this is a slow moving story. no action. no crazy suspense. no abrupt surprises. if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. on the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. it's truly fantastic. i really mean that.ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. they act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence. still it did not ruin the movie.the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.bottom line: the movie's flow is slow. the dialog is fascinating. the story builds gently, systematically and substantive. the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.

after a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna, discussing life and love. the primary reason to see "before sunrise," is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines. as "celine," this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties. risking overstatement, celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving. we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing. if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar. ethan hawke as "jessie" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a maynard g. krebs of the nineties. attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots. his pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee. nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine. his oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation. when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere. after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up. given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. he contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year. when the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant. for whatever reason, she probably won't show, while jesse, who ends up working at target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone.despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, "before sunrise" is a beautiful movie. i highly recommend both it and the sequel, "before sunset."

when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. i, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. people i talked to said there was too much talking! plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. they also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy or sad. this disgusts me. nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? and as for the ending (and i don't want to be a spoiler), i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again. it's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. it's a very personal film that doesn't speak to all people. but it certainly spoke to me. give it a chance! be patient with it! richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna. watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass. it's very intimate. plus, ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. they must have improvised during some parts and it works well. they have a great chemistry in their roles. their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr. linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made. it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much. bravo for romance!!!

this movie is intelligent. that is, more than most other movies, it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it. the story also relies heavily on dialogue. it has some parallels to lost in translation, although before sunrise is much brighter, somehow less abstract, and simply a lot better.the script, the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic. the actors play absolutely brilliantly. rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together.the dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top. it does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing. balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors. sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous! only very, very rarely is "love" in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic. every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic. i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect. she still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after.this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss. one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s!

before sunrise has many remarkable things going on, almost too many to fit into one review like this, but it's suffice to say that it's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema, to be observant not about love, per-say, so much as it's about a human connection. how does one fall in love at first sight? no one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film. and *yet* there is the possibility of as intense a connection, of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time. linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie, a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna, and on the way there start to talking about things, at first arbitrary, then personal (jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather). jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in vienna, until his plane the next morning.before sunrise gives jessie and celine, in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance, and in a sense is about the act of having conversations, of what it's like to watch people having one leading into another and another. here it's often about relationships and commitments, as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. we hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you'll love your life, of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form, or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul (i loved the bit about the quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. jessie may be more responsible for that last part, but what's fascinating about the film is that it's never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives.meanwhile, it's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles, where they're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode, but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film, which isn't a bad one at all but a necessary one, one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other, where sweet asides are actually acceptable ("i have to tell you a secret", jessie says, and then leans in for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way. i loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal, or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share, but really are seeing them do it first-hand. all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future...featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness, however self-contained, as it may lead into something more. who's to say you can't suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and be that much more attached than a married couple? this is perhaps linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than just that. it's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. one scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other's friend. a+

this is truly truly one of the best movies about love that i've ever seen. closely followed by none other than "before sunset", which technically isn't another movie at all, since it's about the same two people and the same romance.this is "love" in the real world. ok, that's only if most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leads in the movie. reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other folks are crazy over dialog-based movies as well. and this is what makes "before sunrise" so good. the dialog is perfect. it's so real, so engaging and funny. it's hardly a surprise that jesse and celine fall in love, 'coz you fall in love with them at the very same time.my favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop, where they pretend to phone their best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. it's perfect. brings you back to the very moment when you fell in love for the very first time in your life.i must say that if you have a choice, do watch "before sunrise" before watching "before sunset". if like me, you watched "sunset" first, it's hard to shake off the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the entire show.once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. wonderful acting, excellent script, and beautiful locations. young love, at it's best.

richard linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. julie delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train ethan hawke. the dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.

sweet and charming, funny and poignant, plot less but meaningful, "before sunrise" (1995), the third movie of richard linklater, is dedicated to everyone who ever been in love, is in love, or never been in love but still dreams of it and hopes to find it. it is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. it seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. two young people in their early 20s, two college students (american tourist ethan hawke who is returning home after the summer in europe and the french student julie delpy who goes to paris to attend the classes in sorbonne) meet on a train. they are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. they talk and fall in love. that's it, that's the movie. it could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). high praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. julie delpy, who looks like a botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.

first let me say that before sunrise, like all movies, is not a movie for all tastes. it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. for me, like most folks here, before sunrise struck a deep chord in me, i was truly stunned, moved, inspired by it. this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. it creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it.the movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. it is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and celine's discussions, but rather the little nuances, the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. it captures an honest, romantic, yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. and what happens after that night is open for debate, but i never doubt that they won't each other again.the facile comments by rockythebear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.see it and it may change your way of life.

i watched this movie 10 years ago. and have watched it on video an average of once a year since. it's the type of movie that's timeless, because the themes are universal, yet the stories and conversation are so personal. it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll, despite the fact that there are, really, just two (very involving) characters. this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy, who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv, and now, the phenomenon is rampant! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space, and makes you think, however jaded you may be, that you are one of those characters. it also made me want to ride the train around europe! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie. maybe that speaks about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.

there are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lifetime, but for some reason or another we remember those persons for the rest of our lives. these once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet these people anymore. we don't always even know their names, as we are never presented to each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. it's funny how common humanity makes occasional friends and we like to keep it as such, because reuniting might spoil fond memories, or we don't know do they. we are too afraid to check that out.the movie 'before sunrise' just caught me watching it. i never had intention to watch it through, but because the discussion between the couple seemed interesting, i gave a look for the rest of the film. i didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. they had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. i believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. it makes us all think about all those people we have met only once in our lives.

if you are a traveller, if there is a fire burning into your heart, if you'd call "home" every place on earth, but none of them can give you enough, if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there, see this movie and you'll find out a little, but wonderful, piece of life sitting next to you.

i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago, but its concept interested me when i heard it: an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking. it sparked my interest, but i never expected it to be this great. before sunrise is a masterpiece, and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. to my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. it's impossible to really talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like my dinner with andre, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see it. see it!

it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other. ethan hawke (jesse) "tape" '01 and julie delpy (celine) "er" 94 tv series (nicole). this gal and guy, will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years. jesse and celine have great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them. i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film, you will feel the same way.

"before sunrise" is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever. dialog and acting are great. i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts. of course, the romantic vienna, introduced in the movie does not exist (you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night) and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night, either (especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in vienna). but that's not the point. the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic. although, nothing ever really happens, the movie never gets boring. the ending is genuinely sad without being "titanic" or something. even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film! i'm a little skeptic about the sequel that is going to be released in summer. the first part is perfect as it is, in my opinion.

i want céline and jessie go further in their relationship, i want to tell them that they were made for each other, that in a lot of moment in the film we want they to die for each other. their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached. this is about love but not stupid things like in "notting hills" or those kind of movie. this is life and i did believe in them, i did believe they were falling... this was so clever and touching. i have just finished to view it a minute ago and i m still there... i want to go to vienna. i want to see them as soon as possible again.i have to say i was now becoming misanthropist and felt like if love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie i realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when, something could really happen.i'm french and didn't know very well july delpy despite kieslowski "three colors : white"... now i have to see her other works because she looks like an angel and got a perfect acting.i saw "before sunset" (the sequel in paris) a few days before i saw "before sunrise" and their is no matter. they are both masterpieces. proof that you don't need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. i'm sorry for my english which i m trying to best.franck in france

while traveling by train through europe, the american jesse (ethan hawke) and the french celine (julie delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria. on the next morning, jesse returns to united states of america, and celine to paris. "before sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen. it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning. the direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer. i have just completed my review number 1,000 in imdb, and i choose "before sunrise" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me. i cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances. yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and i still love it. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "antes do amanhecer" ("before sunrise")

before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. richard linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. the film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. while most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance', which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. the story follows two people, jesse; an american and celine; a french girl that meet on a train into vienna. they instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna...before sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. this allows the characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. this kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they're watching a film and not observing real life; but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. a truly great script cannot work on it's own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although i'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. i don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.in a film like this, it is the writing that's the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which i personally could relate to. this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that's the case with the musings in this script. adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna. the city itself isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. before sunrise is what it is. and what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.

this has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. while "rebel without a cause" and "say anything" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots and hollywood divergences. this movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. you never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people. you almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between jesse and celine, and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it. this movie is mostly all dialogue -based. but, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. what makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. how in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. this is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. and what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. this could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random. and what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of vienna in which this film takes place. it just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. and no matter how many times i watch this film, i don't think i will ever tire of that.

even this early in his career, capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing. this is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. the first part looks like a cinderella story, though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune.nonetheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clichés. then the movie does become more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. the ending is very predictable but satisfying. i also want to compliment the title-writing: very witty and fun.

that certain thing is the story of a gold digger (viola dana) from a tenement house. her mother uses her to take care of her two brothers, but they are a loving family. although dana's character has the opportunity to marry a streetcar conductor, she refuses and holds out for a millionaire. everyone makes fun of her for her fantasy, but are surprised when one day she really does meet a millionaire, son of the owner of the popular abc restaurant chain. the two marry hastily, but the girl's dreams of wealth are shattered when the rich father disowns his son for marrying a gold digger. however, she truly loves her new husband and the two are unexpectedly successful at making it on their own.a rare glimpse of movie star viola dana, this film is a lot of fun. dana's role is accessible, natural, and entertaining. she displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.the mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too. the camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility. the title cards are also incredibly clever.if you like films like my best girl, it, or the patsy, you will enjoy this film.

i have not read the novel, though i understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that i rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. having not read a single word of austen's writing, i really can't compare this to any of her work. what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. this made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect british and verbal material. every acting performance is spot-on, and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. the characters are well-written, credible and consistent. i did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. it does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. i can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and i'd watch it again. there is brief language in this. i recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10

this is an ok adaptation, but not as good as the tv version. the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley, particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version. gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again, i preferred kate beckinsale's emma. there are excellent support performances from toni collette, juliet stephenson and sophy thompson.the script is often played too much for laughs, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent.my biggest criticism is the scenery. it is far too lush. england has never been like this. it looks like a chocolate box. only americans would make it like this.despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more.

"emma woodhouse" gwyneth paltrow (shakespeare in love, duets) has nothing to do with herself but painting, going with her friends on her chariot up and down, saying hello to people in town, and trying to match make everybody she knows. i guess there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. i wish she had read a little more. i like gwyneth, and think that she is a lovely young woman. she is talented, and in "emma" one has the privilege to hear gwyneth sing. i am looking forward to seeing "duets", where she is suppose to sing. she is brave to speak british english with all those native britons, including emma thompson's sister, "miss bates" sophie thompson (four weddings and a funeral, dancing at lughnasa). "mrs. elton" juliet stevenson (truly, madly deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. gwyneth is part of the american movie royalty, being none other than the daughter of director bruce paltrow (st. elsewhere) and tony award winner blythe danner (the myth of fingerprints). she will hopefully be around for a real long time. lucky us! i liked emma and also recommend it. it is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days. favorite scenes: emma singing and playing the piano. i specially like it when she sings a duet. favorite quotes: mr. knightley": emma, you didn't ask me to contribute a riddle." emma: "your entire personality is a riddle, mr. knightley. i thought you overqualified." miss bates: "it left us speechless, quite speechless i tell you, and we have not stopped talking of it since."

first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd, it is on of my favorite movies of all time. i have read the book, but i really think the movie is much better. i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr. knightley was an excellent chose. he was brilliant!it's a 10/10 movie!!!

if you have any clue about jane austen´s production, you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but i like austen´s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma. the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow, she´s very good in her leading role. also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.

emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel. i have not read the book so i really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot. there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it. of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma. the film also stars toni collette(who has okay but has been much better) ewan mecgreger(who has also been better but he is still very good here) alan cumming(who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and jeremy northam(who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.

a slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. this came out around the time of sense and sensibility, and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention. emma is jane austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.

"emma" was a product of what might be called by the first great jane austen cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on british television, doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the second great jane austen cycle which started with "pride and prejudice" two years ago. we currently have in the cinemas the austen biopic "becoming jane", and itv have recently produced three tv movies based on austen novels. these include "northanger abbey", the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. no doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. (there is, after all, her juvenile "love and freindship" (sic), the short novella "lady susan", and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments "the watsons" and "sanditon". then there are all those austen sequels churned out by modern writers).the main character is emma woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in regency england. (not, as some reviewers have assumed, victorian england- austen died before queen victoria was even born). emma is, financially, considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, robert martin, believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton. this scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as elton has no interest in harriet, but has fallen in love with emma herself. the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. this being a jane austen plot, emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications.emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome mr knightley, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage. it does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one (unlike, say, that of elizabeth bennett and mr darcy). knightley, who is sixteen years older than emma (she is 21, he 37), and related to her by marriage, is more like a father-figure than a lover. much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. when emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend miss bates, it is knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. (his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). both gwyneth paltrow and jeremy northam play their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances.of the other characters, i liked juliet stephenson's vulgar mrs elton and toni collette's harriet. i know that in the novel harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character collette played in "muriel's wedding"- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, fretting about her chances of finding a man. nevertheless, i felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from austen's themes."emma" is one of austen's more light-hearted works, without the darker overtones of "mansfield park" or even "pride and prejudice", and this is reflected on screen. we see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who make a very brief appearance, the only "poor" people we see are mrs bates and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverty is relative, not absolute. in emma's world, poverty is defined as not having your own stately home. this is, of course, not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life, but nobody has ever claimed austen as the regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist. sophisticated romantic comedy, combined with a keen eye for analysing human character, was more in her line.i would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 "sense and sensibility" or the recent "pride and prejudice"- it tends to drag a bit in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highly enjoyable austen adaptation. 7/10

lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th century england. northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other. good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material (which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism). i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and i thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do. very good results.

wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds, emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways.emma (gwyneth paltrow) is a graceful, intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which emma takes the credit in matchmaking. eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her, she decides to match the vicar, mr. elton (alan cummings) with her pretty young friend, harriet (toni collette).the result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out, with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought.the film is full of jane austen's witty and wry characterizations. gwyneth paltrow is at her best, portraying this maiden of a restrained, polite society with wit and ease. her growing romance with the unparalleled mr. knightley (jeremy northam) is the heart of this film. mr. knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. he is incredibly handsome, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. he is certainly well-matched to gwyneth paltrow. their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant, has blossomed as he, a family friend, matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. with a wry look or understated jab at emma, northam's knightley is a delight to watch.other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson, greta scacchi, ewan mcgregor, polly walker, and the talkative spinster, miss bates, who is very funny.seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations, emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment.

i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really great. gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr. knightly with his poise and nobility. i wasn't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all. like i said, as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well. i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one!

i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect!"emma" is one of austen's most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters. the movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (miss bates above all). what engaged me in the novel, and the movie renders it clearly, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relation are handled, and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did: that most and still fascinates me. we can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just replace costumes, and use a more current language but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations, and still the difficulty in revealing, and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love: every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value. the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), toni colette is simply great. and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! and then, the breathtaking english countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension... a really enjoyable and deserving movie.

well, i guess i'm emotionally attached to this movie since it's the first one i went to see more than 10 times in the cinema ... helping me through my master's thesis, or rather keeping me from working on it!but on watching it again several years (and many many movies) later - what a well-crafted little gem this is! i've never seen gwyneth paltrow in a more convincing performance, and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley - where does one meet such a man??? <<<sigh>>> sophie thompson's turn as ms bates is virtuoso acting of the finest (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either - toni colette brings a lot of muriel to her harriet, and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming - and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple!of course the sets and costumes, and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood, almost hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - although as far as cinematography and art decoration go, it's almost a case of visual overload. very very pretty, but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period. but the good thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing - that keep it from sinking into saccharine merry old england mode.my particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing here, and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully. pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long - cut two shots (i can think of exactly which ones!) and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie.gosh, i just realize (by reading the imdb listings) that i've seen jeremy northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him - seems he's got a lot more going for him, as an actor, than just being a gentlemanlike english heartthrob! hmm, guess i need to pay my video store a visit...lovely movie. my favorite jane austen adaptation so far - though perhaps ang lee's sense and sensibility is, strictly speaking, the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and i've certainly seen it many more times! watch it if you can - and don't be too hard on its little imperfections.

this is a good adaptation of austen's novel. good, but not brilliant.the cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.the acting is competent. ms paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. in other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. personally, i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in "the high life" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part. acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth, and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level.

emma is a true romance. if you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. she shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to. jeremy northam, as the hero. how shocked are you? i never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! what the right role can do for you! he looks so good as the sensible, regal mr. k, that i am literally looking at him in a new light. he makes and excellent romantic lead. the charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!ewan mcgregor, greta sacchi brings in the rest. a good cast. a good movie. if you are a fan of jane austen, see this movie, along with pride and prejudice - and most importantly, buy the books. it enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary

jane austen would definitely approve of this one!gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma. she is funny without being excessively silly, yet elegant. she puts on a very convincing british accent (not being british myself, maybe i'm not the best judge, but she fooled me...she was also excellent in "sliding doors"...i sometimes forget she's american ~!). also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law (emma thompson's sister and mother) as the bates women. they nearly steal the show...and ms. law doesn't even have any lines!highly recommended.

i have no idea how a texan (the director, douglas mcgrath) and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms. paltrow was in the first place! i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar-winning "shakespeare in love" performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse. she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this.of course, she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette, greta scacchi, juliette stevenson et al...jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest, even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow (in the process, allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship); several years on, ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, personally, i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays. but the standout is, without a doubt, sophie thompson (sister of emma thompson, daughter of phyllida law) as miss bates; what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates, as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn. the film is worth watching (again even) for her performance alone.all in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system. well worth a rental (because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again--but we'll always have emma).

romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing. `emma,' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath, stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role. a self-appointed matchmaker, emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another. coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, harriet (toni collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying. meanwhile, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr. knightley (jeremy northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma's, and lend some needed balance to the proceedings. and emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all: her own. the world goes round and love abounds, but emma is about to miss the boat. luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings. now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it. but as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment.	mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world. there may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone: love. and with mcgrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable. it's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place. it's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow.	the winsome paltrow, who won the oscar for best actress for `shakespeare in love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre. she personifies all things british, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether. she's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy. she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of audrey hepburn. yet paltrow is unique. as an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `hard eight,' `hush' and `a perfect murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own. but it's with characters like emma that she really shines. she is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing. and for emma, she is absolutely perfect.	jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley, and like paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent `the golden bowl,' in which he played an italian prince, was less than satisfying. here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real. like colin firth's mr. darcy in the miniseries `pride and prejudice,' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr. knightley.	also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette, as emma's friend harriet smith; and alan cumming, as the reverend elton. respectively, collette and cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film. and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre.	the supporting cast includes greta scacchi (mrs. weston), denys hawthorne (mr. woodhouse), sophie thompson (miss bates), kathleen byron (mrs. goddard), phyllida law (mrs. bates), polly walker (jane fairfax) and ewan mcgregor (frank churchill). an uplifting, elegant film, `emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness. and even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit. and that's the magic of the movies. i rate this one 9/10.  

this is one of the best films i have seen in years! i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan, but she is excellent as emma woodhouse. alan cumming is superb as reverand elton, and emma thompson's sister, sophie, is hysterical as miss bates. and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr. knightley; what a gentleman! whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma. i think that is what separates it from so many others--it's classy.if you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family, or looking for a romance for yourself, look no further. emma is that movie. with a beautiful setting, wonderful costumes, and an outstanding cast (have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam?), emma is a perfect ten!

i was so impressed with doug mcgrath's film version of the jane austen novel "emma," and i loved the music score by rachel portman so much, that when i went to the video store one day and discovered the two had re-united for "nicholas nickleby" i immediately rented it without any other consideration.i have read the book, and for those overly-critical fans of this jane austen adaptation, i don't know what else mcgrath could have done to more perfectly capture the spirit and major plot elements of miss austen's work, especially given the limitations of a two hour movie (which some have complained about being too long!). and as far as gwen paltrow's accent is concerned, i must confess i wasn't too familiar with her when i saw this at the theater initially, and i was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an english actress!i am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. that is one of the things i enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the english countryside. the film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. if your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like "death wish iii!"the english country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings. mcgrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.this refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. the story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching.i have seen many competent jane austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite.

by no means my favourite austen novel, and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress, but i found the film almost totally delightful. paltrow does a good job, and cummings, stevenson and the one who plays 'miss bates' are all absolutely terrific. the period detail is not alienating; the feel of the movie is just right, in fact. but the real 'find' is jeremy northam as mr knightley. there could not be more perfect casting, imo. i hated mr k in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment, either! highly recommended. anar

what a delightful film...accompanied by oscar-winning composer rachel portman's lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year.incredible casting...gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma. toni collette was great as harriett smith.the character who stole the film was miss bates!!! she was mesmerizing to watch, one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her. one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages. from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr. woodhouse for sending "that lovely quarter-hind of pork... pork, mother!!!" she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother, mrs. bates (played by emma thompson's mother, phyllida law) who looks forlorn and lost.the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf. it is a classic scene, one to be rewound and played over & over...the ending is right up there with "sense & sensibility" and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend...i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.i adored it!

jimmy cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage-producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming "talking" movies.this story of love, deceit, women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment. the direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done. the story never really got lost in this frantic pace.some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time-frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time.jimmy cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film, never loosing his composure as the ever-working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros. in this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business, he was a broadway producer before he started this. joan blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest, nan, she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time, so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change.the only problem i had with the film were the enormous productions at the end. these were magnificent in itself, beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced, but they just didn't seem to fit in the story. the only link they have to the main story is that cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. i had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater. in this way the "sitting on a backyard fence" was much more appropriate to the story.the productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing. i was tired after seeing the first musical sequence and then i realized there were another two coming up. these sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well.all in all a great film with a sour ending.9/10

089: footlight parade (1933) - released 9/30/1933, viewed 5/5/07.the ice cream cone is invented in new york.kevin: after a long and busy break, we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros. this time it's the ultra-fast paced footlight parade, starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent. i am 100% certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent, who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute. joan blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest. the ruby keeler/dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable. one thing that baffled me was berkeley's performances themselves, which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards. obviously busby doesn't let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure. i liked nearly all of this movie until the end, with the shamelessly offensive number "shanghai lil," which, as one can guess, is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come.doug: six movies in three months. got to be a new record. anywaythis completes warner bros.' musical trilogy of 1933, preceded by '42nd street' and 'gold diggers of 1933.' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row. i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie, or if that the role as written was inspired by busby. i hope it was; it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does. the funny thing about cagney was that he didn't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense. he was 5'7", square-headed, and talked with an odd new york accent. but the guy was quite versatile, going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast-talking producer-types we see here. and he could dance. basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor. the rest of the cast has some familiar faces; joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney's loyal and lusting secretary; dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple, but seem to get less screen time than before; billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp. the movie is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-code era, as opposed to those of the 50's and 60's that were more family oriented, and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year (the "shanghai lil" number not withstanding, with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese).last film: dinner at eight (1933). next film: i'm no angel (1933).

such energy and vitality. you just can't go wrong with busby berkley films and this certainly must be his best. of course the choreography is wonderful, but also the banter between cagney and blondell is so colorful and such a delight. don't miss this one.

wow... what... a whirlwind. the 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine, especially during the early talkies phase. there were movies which are painfully static and dull, like "dracula" with bella lugosi, and there were those that just don't give it a rest, sometimes in a good way and other times not. this is one of the films that don't stop for a minute, and that is both a wonder and a pity. lloyd bacon, who also directed "42nd street", must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema, for he filled this picture with it. there mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking. it's completely crazy! i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 (or a 6, tops) because the pacing was very poor, since it was insanely fast and i sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think. the characters seemed to just running to and fro places, talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else. i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache. i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in "42nd street", ruby keeler, and "42nd street" was a movie whose ending was the best part of it. and you know what? it happened the same thing with "footlight parade"! the ending is absolutely incredible! it has become, hands down, the most impressive musical i have ever seen. the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are, believe me, something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth. the numbers are flawless! there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one. suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work, beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache.

the wit and pace and three show stopping busby berkley numbers put this ahead of the over-rated 42nd street. this is the definitive 30's musical with a knockout frenetic performance from jimmy cagney. one of the last releases before the motion picture production code was strictly enforced. a must see.

in 1933 dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. gold diggers of 1933, 42nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players.all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney. warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash. both lack the infectious energy of cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical. he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend.of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is. the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh, hugh herbert, guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size. busby berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in 34. sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again. gentility and morality made sure of it.

never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely: dick powell, (scott blair) who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler, (bea thorn). james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's. chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs. joan blondell, (nan prescott) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty. dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career. enjoy.

a wonder. one of the best musicals ever. the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular, but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell. (keeler is also lovely, even though she may not have been a great actress). there's a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today, much less in the usually stilted 30s films, even though the plot, involving the setting up of movies prologues, is quite dated.

i loved this film, seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen! the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was most enjoyable.i do, as a singer and musical director, question one section of roby keeler's vocal in "by a waterfall." the key modulated, and she was suddenly singing much lower, in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals.does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer? it sounds it to me. i would love to know.thanks so much.

clever, gritty, witty, fast-paced, sexy, extravagant, sleazy, erotic, heartfelt and corny, footlight parade is a first-class entertainment, what the movies are all about.the realistic, satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking. to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this! the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today, especially considering that "realism" has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema.this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age. i'd recommend watching any film from this period, that is 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be.

it's hard to say which comes out on top, james cagney's charm and energy or the mouth- opening excesses of busby berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close. i give it a tie, with footlight parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early thirties musicals. although the movie clearly belongs to cagney, joan blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line. and what's the story line? it's about chester kent (cagney) who produces musicals, and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. he starts doing prologues, live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them, moving them around the country. he's a ball of fire and ideas, and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. but a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas; nan prescott (blondell), his wise-cracking secretary, loves him but he's too busy too notice; an office girl in black-rimmed, round glasses (ruby keeler) wants a chance to dance; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him; his partners are cheating him...my gosh, what's next? this may all sound like a lot to digest, but everything happens fast, with cagney bouncing, strutting, striding, finger-snapping, barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing -- doing a step or two just to show how it's done. instead of "let's put on a show, gang" we have "we need to build three shows in three days, so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing." these three super prologues are going to feature 40 chorines, spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract, with forty kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole apollo movie house circuit! exhaustion threatens, feet ache, but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes (which include ann sothern and dorothy lamour; you can quickly spot sothern but lamour is more generic) stay the course, dancing their hearts out, giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty. and then the curtains go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses, one after the other on the same night, with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save chester's skin or not. first up is "honeymoon hotel" with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness, with brides and grooms (some might even be married), bedrooms and beds, and doors with "do not disturb" signs. then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of "by a waterfall" that probably had the warner brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. this number is so excessive -- dozens of swimming girls, trees, fountains, a huge grotto with waterslides, a giant pool -- you'd never think there was a depression on. berkeley pulls out all his tricks -- synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things -- and he does it in the water, with a lot of underwater photography looking up. the girls are sure game. they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. ruby keeler, who has a couple of quick shots in the water, is the only one who looks a bit cautious. and finally, the smash finale...11 minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to "shanghai lil," with all sorts of bar girls and their customers, unusual in that the races are mixed up. there's cagney and keeler dancing on the bar, dancing on a table, cagney fighting. there are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines, hupping back and forth, rifles tossed and caught. then...this is true...a human picture forms of franklin roosevelt and the nra eagle. this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured roosevelt, a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy chinese prostitutes. that's entertainment, folks. it's great! of course, chester's prologues get the big contract and nan gets chester. the movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile. ruby keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along. joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality. the movie, however, belongs to cagney, who grabs and shakes it, and to berkeley, a man for whom too much was never too much.

james cagney is best known for his tough characters- and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot 'soft' characters in his career. this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in.cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing. and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it. he plays the role with a lot of confidence. he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time, so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career. he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in.the movie is directed by lloyd bacon, who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre. his earliest '30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as "42nd street". his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really. '30's musicals never were really about its singing, this was something that more featured in '40's and later made musicals, mainly from the mgm studios.as usual it has a light and simple story, set in the musical world, that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch. so do the characters and actors that are portraying them. sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie, when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines.the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done, even though i'm not a too big fan of the genre itself. once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy barty. he often played little boys/babies/mice and whatever more early on in his career, including the movie musical "gold diggers of 1933", of one year earlier. a recommendable early genre movie.8/10

i have a feeling that the warners bros depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years. yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you been living under a rock) and times look bleak. but we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. in the 30's, film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom. "footlight parade (1933)" was one such film that audiences flocked to. while this lloyd bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as "gold diggers of 1933 (1933)" does, it's still a wonderful showcase of talent. we have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece busby berkely extravaganza numbers, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. yes, little ruby keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is so-so, but busby's magical "by a waterfall" whisks her, and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls, into a dizzying water wonderland. of course busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage (they defy limits of gravity, for one thing), and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough, wisecracking non-musical scenes. and "footlight" also has james cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals (really, what couldn't this man do?). he even gets to take over from the leading man, don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot shanghai lil (who is really little ruby in china-girl wig!).he co-stars with joan blondell, his adorable, adoring secretary who cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women (until the final reel, that is). apparently blondell was the only other woman who cagney loved apart from his wife. and you can see the mutual adoration in every scene.

an excellent example of the spectacular busby berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930's. audiences must've been very surprised to see james cagney in this type of vehicle. quite a contrast from his "public enemy" 2 years earlier. cagney does add spark & interest to a rather routine tired out formulated storyline & plot. but the highlight of the movie is the 3 elaborate production numbers back to back. first with the conservative "honeymoon hotel" number,then followed by the very spectacularly eye dazzling "by a waterfall" sequence,followed by the closing "shanghai lil" sequence, cagney only participates in the last number hoofing it up on top of a bar counter with ruby keeler. the "shanghai lil" number with cagney is excellent but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic after the more exciting & incredibly mind boggling "by a waterfall" choreography.if i was the director i would've inserted the "shanghai lil" number in the middle & close with "by a waterfall",which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water so to speak & in my view the best of the 3 numbers. the 3 production numbers are the frosting on the cake & james cagney's performance is added decoration to the cake. an outstanding musical achievement,a 4 star movie, the ultimate musical,well worth watching,you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!

this is a wonderful film. the non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate. the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated. i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts. joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together. some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of today's movies. put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is.

fast-paced, funny, sexy, and spectacular. cagney is always terrific. blondel charms you with her wit and energy. it's obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the innuendo in the script, the costumes,and the way they touch each other. and bikinis before there were bikinis! this is no holds barred fun for everyone. i don't understand the john garfield issue though. does it matter whether or not he's in this film? if he is, he screen is so short that he's basically a prop. you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's there. i'm a big cagney fan, but had never seen this one before. i found it on turner classics. i found it by wonderful accident. sit back and enjoy the ride!

when it came out, this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment. to this day it's more entertaining than most, in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty "girl friday" played by joan blondell. also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes.but this is a pretty strange movie. i mean in one of those numbers, you've got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler, doing all kinds of weird stuff. ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times, but at least she's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films. you'd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney. as for cagney, his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time. after a while it gets a bit too much. you expect him to walk out and say, "hey! i've got a great idea for a prologue! the women are cigarettes, and they come out of a pack of smokes! oh no, we did that one last month!" it's funny but it gets a bit repetitive. in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl, ruth donnelly, some of the established cagney gangster character comes out. in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching, and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very "street" even though the characters aren't criminal.the musical numbers... what can you say? they stand alone as entertainment, the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling. but none of them really mean anything. it means "honeymoon hotel", nothing really more or less. and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately, since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays. for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper, things like that. the whole thing could only exist on film, so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous. i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so, because this is a very polished production.it's great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills, and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler. cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well. the music i would say is only mediocre, but mostly pleasing if repetitive. bacon's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting. the film's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way. it's a cut above most "let's put on a show" films of the 30s.

of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film. from that point of view it is utter fantasy. but who cares? it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane, battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching. films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes.it is about what cinema does best: great camera-work, great settings and great performances.the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented, keeping the best till last.i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and...

"footlight parade" is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros. produced in the early 1930's to ward off the depression. "42nd street" and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era, and they made literally, millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while, and enjoy themselves.while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell, ruby keeler, and dick powell, only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney. almost ten years prior to his most well-known musical, "yankee doodle dandy". here he dances in that most original of dance styles, with his arms usually lowered at his side, and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks. it's easy to see that he is enjoying himself, and that makes us enjoy him all the more.while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film, they are well worth the wait. i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqué. but it's all in fun.it doesn't matter what the plot of the film is, just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast. besides those already mentioned, guy kibbee is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10

the energetic young producer of theatrical prologues (those staged performances, usually musical, that often proceeded the movie in the larger cinemas in bygone days) must deal with crooked competition, fraudulent partners, unfaithful lovers & amateur talent to realize his dream of making his mark on the footlight parade.while closely resembling other warner's musical spectaculars, notably the golddigger films, this movie had a special attraction none of the others had: jimmy cagney. he is a wonder, loose-jointed and lithe, as agile as any tomcat - a creature he actually mimics a few times during the movie. cagney grabs the viewers attention & never lets go, powering the rapid-fire dialogue and corny plot with his charisma & buoyant charm.the rest of the cast gives their best, as well. joan blondell is perfect as the smart-mouthed, big-hearted blonde secretary, infatuated with cagney (major quibble - why wasn't she given a musical number?). dick powell & ruby keeler once again play lovers onstage & off; the fact that her singing & acting abilities are a bit on the lean side are compensated for by her dancing ; powell still exudes boyish enthusiasm in his unaccustomed position as second male lead.guy kibbee & hugh herbert are lots of fun as brothers-in-law, both scheming to cheat cagney in different ways. ruth donnelly scores as kibbee's wealthy wife, a woman devoted to her handsome protégés. frank mchugh's harried choreographer is an apt foil for cagney's wit. herman bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger. mavens will spot little billy barty, jimmy conlin & maybe even john garfield during the musical numbers.finally, there's busby berkeley, choreographer nonpareil. his terpsichorean confections, sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930's, were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that depression audiences wanted to enjoy. the big joke about berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were meant, as part of the plot, to be stage productions. but no theater could ever hold these products of the master's imagination. they are perfect illustrations of the type of entertainment only made possible by the movie camera.berkeley's musical offerings generally took one of two different approaches, either a story (often rather bizarre) told with song & dance; or else stunning geometrically designed numbers, eye candy, featuring plentiful chorus girls, overhead camerawork & a romantic tune. in a spasm of outré extravagance, footlight parade climaxes with three berkeley masterworks: `honeymoon hotel' and its pre-production code telling of a couple's wedding night; `by a waterfall' - dozens of unclad females, splashing, floating & diving in perfect patterns & designs (peer closely & you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, `shanghai lil' - a fitting tribute to the talents of both cagney & berkeley.

this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic conditions during the 30's. remember, 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then, so this was a minor luxury for many people. it's testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself. you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type-cast in similar movies, e.g. james cagney, william powell, ruby keeler, frank mchugh, joan blondell and guy kibbee . then too, branches of the u.s. military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer, busby berkeley, at the end.

an opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with asians, africans, and anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall? wrong. these are all scenes from a 1933 musical.the first half of "footlight parade" is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film. chester kent (cagney) is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals. his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day, john wayne in "the big trail." before each showing of the flick, a dance number is presented as a prologue. shorts, news reels, serials, and cartoons would later serve the purpose. kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business. kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley. could it be that cagney's character is patterned after berkeley? could be. in preparation for the prologues, kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. he uncovers the traitor, fires him, then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress. his assistant, nan prescott (joan blondell - soon to be mrs. dick powell) has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress. a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain (dick powell) who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn (ruby keeler). the resulting three prologue musicals, which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day, are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago, "honeymoon hotel," "by a waterfall," and "shanghai lil."of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy james cagney. like fred astaire and bill "bojangles" robinson, cagney's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed, although hours went into practice to get each step just right. not as good a singer as astaire, cagney's singing, like astaire's, sounded natural, unlike the crooning so popular at the time. it's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney.most critics prefer the "shanghai lil" segment over the other two. yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of "by a waterfall" is astonishing. how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated. the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see. the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color. though not nearly as socially conscious as "gold diggers of 1933," "footlight parade" stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen.

it has singing. it has drama. it has comedy. it has a story. it's one of the greatest movies ever made ... period. if you can't enjoy this movie, then you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray. in "yankee doodle dandy" james cagney sings and dances his way to an academy award; but in this movie he is better! this is james cagney at his quisessential best! he's fast with the one-liners! he's fast with his feet! it's nonstop action. and the song-and-dance skits are classics, especially "shanghai lil." and the supporting cast is great; and the entire movie is upbeat, fast moving, and exudes confidence. and even though this movie was made over 70 years ago, it's still watchable, even today. and of course, this movie features miss ruby keeler (who was married to al jolson). she is the perfect partner for james cagney ... and dick powell too! if you like upbeat, fast paced movies, with lots of singing and dancing, this is the movie to watch.

the stock market crash of 1929 and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater, in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville. those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front.in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy, out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea. stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters. some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on.footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film. it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot, he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films. he wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had.of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason. but it's so creative and fun to watch. dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade, ah the moon is here, honeymoon hotel, and by a waterfall, the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team. ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade, shanghai lil. joan blondell is cagney's no nonsense girl friday at the theater. like in blonde crazy, she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones. one of blondell's best screen roles.look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them. john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number. and in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne. the duke's voice is unmistakable. but what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade. i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there. i've got to believe that clip was deliberate.footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best.

"footlight parade" is fascinating on so many levels. there is no way the supposedly staged "theater prologues" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course. think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for "by a waterfall," for instance. (berkeley directed john garfield in "they made me a criminal" six years later and had the dead end kids singing "by a waterfall" as they took their showers.) "shanghai lil" is the best production number in the picture. it's a catalog of '30s warner bros. sensibilities. note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes. you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house. here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others. i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a "card section" presentation of roosevelt's image. there's also the nra eagle--the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal. fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression. you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm, of course. warner bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f.d.r. administration. dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker, "lil." she hardly even watches her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature flaws. the pre-code stuff is fun. the "by a waterfall" number is wonderful in that regard. the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on. the spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years. in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.

footlight parade is among the best of the 1930's musical comedy extravaganzas. a snappy script and an all-star cast including jimmy cagney, the lovely joan blondell, dick powell, and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest. directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley, this film will have you grinning from ear-to-ear from start to finish.busby, of course, is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with "gold diggers of 1933" and "42nd street" to his credit (as dance director). footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily-clad chorus girls, a berkeley trademark. the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close-ups of the dancers. his obsession with shapely legs and "rear-view" shots is amply demonstrated here. the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing.our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown. he's surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy, and a gold-digging girlfriend. although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents. joan blondell is memorable as cagney's wise-cracking, lovestruck secretary. and ruby keeler is adorable, as always.the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers, "honeymoon hotel", "the waterfall", and "shanghai lil", each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today's hollywood where so-called "special effects" have replaced creative cinematography.claudia's bottom line: clever and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid. a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp.

simply put, this is the best movie to come out of michigan since... well, ever! evil dead eat your heart out, hatred of a minute was some of the oddest, and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time. i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip, or a good case of the willies!

"hatred of a minute" is a hauntingly beautiful film. a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer, eric seaver. strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a "must see" for any film student or horror fan. the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies. some shout outs to the film's producer, bruce campbell as well as to the film "the evil dead" add some humor for anyone that knows the genre.

michael kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as eric seaver, a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous, abusive, alcoholic stepfather barry (a genuinely frightening portrayal by gunnar hansen). eric has a compassionate fiancé (sweetly played by the lovely tracee newberry) and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue. haunted by his bleak past, egged on by the bald, beaming jack the demon (a truly creepy michael robert brandon), and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother, eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree. capably directed by kallio (who also wrote the tight, astute script), with uniformly fine acting by a sound no-name cast (jeff steiger is especially good as eric's wannabe helpful guardian angel michael), rather rough, but overall polished cinematography by george lieber, believable true-to-life characters, jolting outbursts of raw, shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence, a moody, spooky score by dan kolton, an uncompromisingly downbeat ending, grungy detroit, michigan locations, a grimly serious tone, and a taut, gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout, this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing. a real sleeper.

i thought i should qualify my position after reading other reviews. the movie is not great, but it has a lot of great elements. the lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great. the story is slow and weak, but entertaining. the acting is bad, but no worse than you will find on the syfy channel. the music is pretty good and the gore is good. it has the great leather face in the film and is produced by bruce campbell. i watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable, it was still enjoyable. the women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy. the movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up. there was no sex scenes. i gave it 7 out of 10 and i think that is fair. i would watch it again if i had nothing better to do. the gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil is quite creepy.

"hatred of a minute" is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years. not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's definitely worth a watch. "hatred" chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver (played by director kallio), a formerly abused child now grown up, and starting to listen to his evil side. "hatred" is very nice visually. the shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at. this film actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent michigan releases like "dark tomorrow" and "biker zombies." subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's $350,000 budget. however, "hatred" stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do, and that's in the story and character department. essentially, things just kind-of happen. eric seaver doesn't evolve at all. basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development. also, the ending is very abrupt. however- since this is a horror film, since when do we care about plot? we just want to see people die, and "hatred" certainly delivers. as the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering "kill her! kill em' all!" when people scream back at the screen, it's always fun. that's the place where "hatred" succeeds. it's fun. and in the end, that's all that really matters.

this is a decent little flick made in michigan, about a guy that is haunted by his past, with his abusive stepfather (gunnar hansen) and has grown up not-so-well-adjusted. in fact, he's absolutely bonkers, but tries not to be too obvious. he's got an entourage too, his own little demon & angel that follow him around. the demon never says a word but really, doesn't have to, and he's max schreck-creepy. let's just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this, as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better, like "freeing" people that he decides need it, mostly beautiful young women. this is a decent portrayal of madness, and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on, but overall, i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest. it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on. a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks.

so what constitutes a real independent film? in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge, i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy.which is why we should be glad that films like "hatred of a minute" exist. across the board, this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template (indie horror film). love it or hate it, "hatred" isn't afraid of being what it is, and in watching this film, you get the real sense that kallio (the director) didn't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place, he's in this to tell stories. good ones. you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people pushed over the edge, and that oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel.if you expect smut, or an evil dead ripoff, stay away from this film. but if you dig the finer points of the horror/suspense genres, check this film out.yes. bruce campbell did produce this movie, and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not "evil dead". bruce has never tried to bank on his "ash" image, and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with "hatred" so that it could do so either.my advice, though, to all dead-ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr. campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr. kallio and mr. campbell are trying to show you.the acting is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film. so often, actors in films such as these don't even seem to try, with "hatred", it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously, never resorting to typical horror-film campiness.technically, "hatred" is about as competent as indie film gets. the editing is fast paced, the cinematography is good given the budget, and "hatred" keeps a quick pace, without any bog-down points or bad anti-climaxes.all in all, hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally, i don't see a problem with that. it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium. people who reached into thier broke ass pockets, pulled out thier nickles and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie.check this one out.

despite the occasionally stilted acting and "seen-it-all-before" story, this is a fairly compelling movie.it has suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy, some of the visual effects are superb and best of all, no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film, as too many (wannabe) horror films have in them nowhonestly, this isn't the greatest film ever made, but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character developmenti was glad i watched it

michigan, edgar allen poe, a toaster, and a frying pan . . . if you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre, and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted, this is the movie for you. an amazingly well developed first film, "hatred of a minute" has all the draw of mainstream hits like "silence of the lambs" and of cult classics like "army of darkness." the editing and effects are well done, better than many films in the genre. kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and poe's writings. at a time when big budget, big name films lack much in the way of substance, the independent film has resurrected this dying trait. if you love michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller go check out "hatred of a minute."

i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words "clueless and appalling nonsense." i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment. one has to suspend one's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love, have a child and live together happily ever after. but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one's heart warmed. is it so impossible? there are far more implausible events described in other movies. the acting is good, the script is funny. the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality.

this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978. it was a revelation to us. we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children. obviously we were wrong. love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it. but we both chose that love anyway.and no, it never changed our sexual orientation. that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos.when we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex. as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.this story is not far fetched. however, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me. my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years. we are still gay. end of story.

this is a film for entertainment; i did not think the world made social commentary from one small film. i personally find this film funny, audacious, and memorable. it is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a princess. this film was done very well i might add, in the 70's a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person's sexuality. this movie is not about a person being homosexual or not, it is however about love, in all it's strange forms. this film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70's in hollywood, or in california. pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men. women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community.then the fantasy begins!! let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? well this movie, which in any way was better than that dismal redo "the next big thing". perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better.i enjoyed this movie when i saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips now. i heartily advise anyone who wants a funny, tender movie- to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun. some people need to lighten up!!! and this is the film you should do it with!

this movie is as unique as it is overlooked......a different story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. i first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. this film should be available on dvd/vhs so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster & perry king can be acknowledged, but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned.

in order to stop her homosexual friend albert (perry king) from being deported back to belgium, stella (meg foster) decides to marry him. the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian. the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then into love. later in the film after falling in love, stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing. what she finds will leave the viewer stunned. this is a great film, very original. perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. very controversial upon its release in 1978, the "r" rated film is now "pg" in this much more liberal time.recently released on dvd, the disc contains a "making of" segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not "real" are mistaken. everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!

super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast, an outstanding script, and a firm grip on the approaching 1950's. at the time, rko was turning out classic noirs by the dozens. but whatever the value of those shadowy downers, they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the eisenhower era. few films of the late-40's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy.jim blandings (cary grant) works as an ad-man on madison ave. where in his little daughter's words-- he sells things to people that they don't need, at prices they can't afford. he's making good money, but like thousands of others, he's tired of living in a cramped urban "cave". so, with wife myrnah loy, they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the connecticutt countryside. needless to say, in the arms of nature, they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion.there's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script. i don't know if writers panama and frank got an oscar, but they should have. of course, the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land. the annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage, with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving grant a hard time. of course, no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than grant, so it's just one well-placed laugh after another, particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own. yet, oddly, the film appears to have no comedic high-point. instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point. that's a real movie triumph for any era.reaching back 60 years later, we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind. with their live-in maid, the blandings may not be a typical american family, but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical. and what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than blandings as an "ad-man" tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more "ham". more than anything, however, there's the movie's sunny optimism. oh sure, the feeling falters at times, yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the blandings just stick to their dream carries them through. indeed, life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge, so i expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day. it's that easily over-looked subtext, along with the sheer entertainment value, that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period.so, if you haven't seen it, catch it next time around.

this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes, the money pit and are we done yet?, only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since, regretfully, been lost.i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age, there was much i could laugh at. now of course being familiar with adult frustrations, i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth.the three main actors...cary grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas...interacted perfectly, but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream. it's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions.all in all, this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it.

coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes. directed by h.c. potter and co-written by norman panama and melvin frank ("white christmas"), this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well. of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  cary grant, myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. obviously, hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical tom hanks comedy, 1986's "the money pit", and again last year with ice cube's "are we done yet?". one look at hgtv's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today.the plot begins with ad man jim blandings, his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath manhattan apartment. rather than pursue muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole, the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. however, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, jim, muriel and bill. priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners.with his double takes and flawless line delivery, grant is infallible in this type of farce, and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. in a role originally meant for irene dunne, myrna loy shows why she was hollywood's perfect wife. she doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own. watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. as avuncular, pipe-smoking bill ("colebill cole"), melvyn douglas shows his natural, easy-going élan as grant's foil. smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well-digger mr. tesander, lurene tuttle as jim's officious assistant mary, and louise beavers as the blandings' lovable maid gussie. the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then-wife, actress betsy drake. a most appropriate 1949 cartoon, "the house of tomorrow", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant's film classics complete the extras.

though not seen in too many films prior, you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since. not one of grant's nor loy's best films, they make an outstanding effort together. after all, with that much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughs will be there.the film is light, has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through.a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time.definite saturday afternoon fare, heavy on the popcorn.

movie "comedies" nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin-kicking. modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the undemanding and slow of brain. sure, an occasional good comedy will come along, but they're becoming rarer all the time."mr. blandings buildings his dream house" shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of, and it's just screamingly funny. jim and muriel blandings (cary grant and myrna loy) decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs. the film follows their story, beginning with house hunting trips, the house's riotous construction, all the way to the finished home--with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener".grant and loy are perfect for their roles, of course (grant is particularly funny as he watches the house's costs zoom out of control). however, the film is stolen by the blandings' wise attorney, played to perfection by melvyn douglas. managing to steal every scene he's in, douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis. reginald denny as the blandings' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful.i've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh. i think it's a good film to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.

i don't understand. not being a critic, i am not evaluating the quality of the acting, which i find believable, a good thing. my confusion lies with the content. is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so, what effect their cheating "wives'" infidelity had on them? while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness, did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily? they didn't think of their husbands at all! only of themselves. pardon me, except when they wished their husbands dead.

stuck in a hotel in kuwait, i happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. first pachelbel's canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a tiger moth (which my grandfather, my father and i have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then crowe's name hooked me completely. i was entranced by this film, crowe's performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew avro ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, crowe's recitation of high flight. i won't spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, i admit to crying heartily a couple of times. buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it.ps did i spy a bristol blenheim (in yellow training colours)on the ground? looked like a twin-engine aircraft with a twin-.303 brownings in a dorsal turret.

i became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other i have ever watched. that may be because i can see the characters as my own grandparents, attempting to make sense of a world at war. the ending and use of pachabel's cannon are both amazing.

i felt this film - throughout. i waas impressed with russell crowe's talent in developing his relationship with lillie, such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach, a bit self depreciating and very persistent. really loved the cinematography and direction. pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive.gosh, didn't russell's talent even in 1993 shine! .. and i have yet to see gladiator.

i have just seen this film, and fallen in love with it. there is a little bit of something for everyone, and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between lachlan and lil. when they are on the beach, i nearly cried... there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together. this idea taken from several angles, from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places. the film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last. crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan. i've always had a soft spot for the accent, but i nearly melted with his portrayal of his character. the way this film was shot is also beautiful, with the music, backdrop of the open fields, and superb acting. all together, this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions.

i enjoyed every moment of this movie, even though i knew they could never really be together. with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks, it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940's who must have lived this story.

russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this film. but more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow. everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity. fabulous love story between lachlin and lil. i replay their scenes over and over again. anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. all characters are cast and portrayed excellently.

one of the great classic comedies. not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. a fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home.filled with great characters all of whom, cary grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.a great look at life in the late 40's.

very nicely done movie. it does stay in your memory. better billed as a romance than flying or war, altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free. flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love.fun watching early crowe. he is good and exudes charm. his reading of "high flight" is superb.cheers, boom

this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life. we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight. a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don't just happen on the front.luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents went through during a war. this film, i think, is a small thank you. peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be. it's definitely worth listening to him recite "high flight" and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare.

mr. blandings builds his dream house may be the best frank capra/preston sturges movie neither man ever made! if you love bringing up baby, the philadelpia story, the thin man, i was a male war bride or it's a wonderful life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out. post wwii life is simply and idyllically portrayed.grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. loy is adorable as his pre-now wife. the cast of supporting characters compares to you can't take it with you and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker. art direction and editing are way above par.the movie never stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit.

another example of the unique talents of cary grant. a performance worthy of oscar consideration, yet once again shunned by the academy. mr. grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city. the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis (loosely) for the more modern tom hanks vehicle, "the money pit".if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.

musings: pure delight from beginning to end. not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor. what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including reginald denny, nestor paiva, ian wolfe, harry shannon and jason robards sr.. cary grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. a young carpenter, played by future tarzan lex barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabbeted", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. at that, barker yells up to his mates, "ok boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....yank 'em out!" a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. all grant can do is moan.yes, the movie is dated. you'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.a classic movie that is really a treasure.

this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy's law being applied to home ownership and construction. if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas. their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.

this series could very well be the best britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (fawlty towers, good neighbours, to name just two).what made butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time.i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones. and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time. then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. these people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. they were examples of the "new europeans" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s).of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv, but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro). and, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. a potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief... at the time anyway.butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. it documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come.

looking back over the past 28 years (since my first exposure to the show), all i can say is: once you get it-it will stay with you forever. i remember my initial reaction being: 1) annoyingly overacted, 2)under produced 3) unlikeable characterswell, two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying. a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness. yes, the show has a style that is not for everybody, and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now. but, i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times... btw i am a married man...(for all who think this is a show for females)

british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet, introspective, usually romantic study and the farcical social satire. settings, characters, and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories. butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type. the scripts are very verbal, including long interior monologues by the main character ria, a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life. when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest in her quite clear), she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered.the acting and scripts are always on the money, which makes one's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one: i was neither blown away by it nor turned off. my mother, on the other hand, adored this show. i think the degree to which one identifies with ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one's reaction to butterflies.

this movie is a little unusual in that it's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace. while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. it's sort of like someone said "let's just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed". considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas, the film works very well. while the film has pretty modest pretensions, it makes the most of the material. it's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family.

there is so much to love in this darling little comedy. anyone who has ever built or bought a house, or even just been short of space,will find that there is more than just a grain of truth in the plight of the addled mr. blanding.melvyn douglas,with great comedic flare, both narrates and acts as the blandings' attorney and voice of reason.as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterbrained but extremely patient wife. but the best performance is grant's. he is the american everyman, especially relevant at the time of this film's release, when the nation was in the grips of a housing shortage after the end of the war. the themes are universal,lack of money, work strain, fear of infidelity.yes, it does wrap up awfully neatly, but you must keep in mind that this was a time when the world was just recovering from a terrible war, and wanted a happy ending. it is still relevant today, and i must chalk up the poor reviews i see to a present preference for dumbed down, gross out comedies. the look of the film is slick, and there are some great bits of comedy is well, particularly toward the beginning.while it may have lost some of it's social relevance, nearly sixty years after it's release, it is still a gem.

cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations, both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget.there are many great laughs (even if the story is somewhat thin) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style. a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses, which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience. as he makes his exit, he assures the client (grant) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $100.00 from the total...or at least $50.00...but certainly $25.00. hilarious!

this is one of those little christmas movies for everyone. our scrooge is ben affleck, who decides money is not enough, so he rents the family who lives where he thought his family did. ok? this is a great little high school soap, pg-13, but the small sex references are comedy, so if your kid can't handle them, they can't live in the real world, either.now, affleck is a hunk, and as usual walks through this fun, omg, remember when we did..., ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease. but that's ok, because even this old oracle keeps hoping that if ben's that well proportioned all over, well, there's hope for us ladies yet. luckily, the rest of the ensemble--catharine o'hara, james gandolfini, christina applegate, udo kier and josh zuckerman--fill in and keep this shadow-side-ozzie-and-harriet christmas alternately hilarious, comfortable and warm.this movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn, and when you get back, everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed.this is a happy film, after all, and it leaves you feeling good about life, love, family, christmas and chanel. there really is something for everyone.

what's with all the negative comments? after having seen this film for the first time tonight, i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day. when i saw that drew (ben affleck) might end up spending the holidays alone, i wanted to cry. you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. also, even though i liked tom (james gandolfini) and alicia (christina applegate) after awhile, if you ask me, they were real snobs. however, this film did make me smile and feel good inside. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it.

this movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today. very, very funny. it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it "builds" from there. anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing. great cast. cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film. this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's....clothing, architecture and family life. many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing. i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely. i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it. a true classic.

come on people. this movie is better than 4. i can see this happening...wealthy people have done crazier things than this. and it was funny.i watch a comedy to be entertained, escape from the pressures of the world for a short while, and not to have to take anything too seriously. this movie fully suits that purpose. i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles. i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring, likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home. it will remain on my list of "favorite.....must watch for the holiday season". if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes, watch this one.

you can survive surviving christmas. i thought the television version was a bit edited way down. i like ben afleck. he plays drew johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. the valcos starring james gandolfini and catherine o'hara as the parents and christina applegate as lisa valco, the daughter. drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. bill macy who i best remember for playing maude's husband arthur is hired to play duda, the grandfather. when the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. the valcos household is crumbling apart from the drew situation. drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. you can't buy what you wish for! the acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.

what's not to like about this movie? every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him. what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. it was a win-win situation. a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined. only if.drew latham (ben affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. it was a fun and funny movie.

its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site. it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection. the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role. i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. i rate it right up there with christmas vacation. the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well. the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act. the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks. plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money.

i had some reservations about this movie, i figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about christmas. being in the middle of a heat wave in late june, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.this movie turned out to be one laugh after another. ben affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is james gandofini. he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great "dad".if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.

surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released. ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for christmas. he then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for christmas cheer. i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past (though i did like daredevil and paycheck) but here he is well cast in this role. i also like christina applegate as the daughter in the family who can't stand affleck's character at first. sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care. ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies.

at first i didn't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie,, boy was i wrong, my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all. james gandolfini was funny,, i really liked christina appelagate, and catherine o' hara was good too, the storyline is what really sold me,, i mean,, too put up with family,, at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year,, and probably don't get along with anyway,, you really do need as much alcohol as you're system can stand to deal with christmas,, so i thought that the premise was good there, buying the family with 250000 dollars, was a little on the far fetched side,, but it turned out to work pretty good for me,, cause it was a riot all the way through, it shows the class struggle of the different families. it has lot's of funny moments, including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy. all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too.

what would you expect from a film titled 'surviving christmas'and presented as 'festive fun', something like ghandi or english patient? there are lots of things i love about this film, it's funny, it is very well cast and it is superbly written. i came to the film as a kaplan/elfort fan but was dubious when i read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. but the film doesn't come across like that because affleck (as drew latham) plays his part perfectly, one minute a child-like adult, the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants. in fact we see latham grow up in this film, when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own lot is not so bad.this film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies i have seen. comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama, it either works or it doesn't and very few comedy writers get it correct every time.i particularly loved the drama scene, where the family take to reading parts written by latham . the pleasure is in the reaction of tom valco (james gandolfini) and the comments of brian valco (josh zuckerman). it is the dilemma of the greedy tom valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing to the christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well.the addition of daughter alicia (christina applegate) into the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not in a christmas film? of course its corny and contrived; he's rich and handsome, she's beautiful and single, and so inevitably her and afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face. great! one thing i would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but i can't really complain. i got what i wanted.

this movie isn't as bad as i heard. it was enjoyable, funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season. it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music. when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection. it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. i heard that ben's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. take it for what is it, a christmas comedy with a love twist. i enjoyed it. no, it isn't titanic and it won't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two. so go laugh and have a good time:)

i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role. gandolfini gives his typical a performance. the entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome. i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives. the best part to this film (to me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. namely, the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree. go see it and have a good laugh!

one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr. blandings builds his dream house. although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today. still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham.what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years. returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans. the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft-ellender- wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business.i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties. like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester. their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms, still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did.of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up, threatening to send cary to the cleaners. cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel, usually too late. truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it.myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles. if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does, the film would still work just fine.mr. blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years.

as with all of angelopoulos' films, "the suspended step of the stork" implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer, a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work. dialogues are sparing, with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters' inner conflicts, doubts, or feelings. the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses, and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves. as a result, the acting is understated and implicit, as opposed to overt and explicit.the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation, where the viewer is asked to become a participant, to participate as an actor, by probing his or her own psyche. as in a novel, where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a template where the reader's imagination and/or past experience flourish, angelopoulos' drama rests within his images: his uses of the long shots, the long takes, the leisurely pacing, the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark, inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective. angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity, reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures, gazes, sounds, and music, when he believes that words can only take us so far.the music, by angelopoulos' long time collaborator, eleni karaindrou, provides more than just a discreet background, but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story. a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle, subdued colors, recorded in a drab winter light. angelopoulos presents us with an "other greece," one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures, with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas, drowned in an eternal sunshine. here, the skies are covered and gray, the air is cold and misty, and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled, dirty snow of the village streets. angelopoulos' genius through arvanitis' camera is on display throughout the film."the suspended step of the stork" is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century. it is deeply concerned with the meaning of "borders," and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations. in the "waiting room" facing the albanian border, the refugees, political or other, outcast by the rest of humanity, wait. they may be stuck against a political border, but unfortunately they still carry with them, and hang on, deeper ancestral borders: those of the languages, of the customs, and of the races. although angelopoulos' political views are well known, the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees' plights. in the process, angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical, cultural, political, and personal "borders." angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece, and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions. in this film, he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures, drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus' travel. alexander is a telemachus, in search of a story about an aging greek politician/odysseus who disappeared, never to be heard of again. this political man, a brilliant orator, unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence, his wife, and his brilliant career, to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low. he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world. of course, the "politician" is not alexander's father, but the "politician" stands before alexander like a father figure/odysseus. as with homer's telemachus, alexander grows as a person during his odyssey.of course, it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homer's odyssey in a contemporary context. angelopoulos draws on odysseus's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film. in angelopoulos' ending, "odysseus" is more like the dante's odysseus: he does not leave for ithaca but goes on, "carrying a suitcase." and alexander/telemachus is "suspended" between returning to his home and his career, or embarking on a voyage to "somewhere else." he states as much, in a voice-over at the beginning of the film, paraphrasing few lines from dante's "inferno": "and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again. the wind blows your eyes far away." finally, although angelopoulos is not a religious person, there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen, who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications, and also the christ-like figure of the "politician." in the final scene, these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconography's influence in angelopoulos' work. they appear like "stylites," religious figures found in the orthodox tradition, solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars, in a form of asceticism.the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni. angelopoulos does not give us any clues, and the wife's statement, "it's not him," is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough. the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician, but that he could be the politician. but the film still ends on an optimistic note. whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river, and thus communications across the border are still not possible, and it remains impenetrable, we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river: the camera has crossed the border, and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary. on this account, angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow, some of the borders will eventually crumble.

i loved this film. i first saw it when i was 20 ( which was only four years ago) and i enjoyed it so much, i brought my own copy the next day. the comedy is well played by all involved. i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr. tsanders explains why he found water at 6 ft in one area and 227 feet in another area. also look for jason robards father who plays mr. retch. talent ran in that family.

a most recommendable masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of giants, mastroianni and moreau, and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis. gregory karr's performance may seem overshadowed by his "tough" partners' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character, which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl (khrysikou) and the man (mastroianni), albeit hinted beforehand. (hence the spoiler.)get your expectations straight! it's an "art movie" in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention. not for spending free time, but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert. due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended.dialogues are used sparingly. but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian, kurdish and turkish, which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages.

enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially, william powell, (dr. lawrence bradford), "mister roberts", who played the role as a doctor and detective. dr. bradford was once married to jean arthur, (paula bradford), "shane", and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important. jean arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a california race track. robert armstrong, (nick martel) "king kong" gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with james gleason, a detective who need the help of dr. bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery. if you see this film, just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in those days!

"the ex-mrs. bradford" (1936), starring thin man series star william powell (this film was released the same year as the second thin man film, "after the thin man," comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the thin man films, but it nonetheless misses. still, it is a wonderfully fun, highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein.is myrna loy missed? of course, let's not lie. however, i'd be hard-pressed to name a better substitute than jean arthur. and the chemistry between arthur and co-star william powell is real and it's fun, romantic and involving.the story and screenplay by anthonyu vieller and john wyne's production company partner, james edward grant ("the angel & the bad man") is close to being up there with a thin man effort, but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle.while it's not in the stratosphere of 'the thin man" movies (what else is?), "the ex-mrs. bradford" is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery-comedy "who-done-its" of the '30s & 40s.

william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in "the ex-mrs. bradford," also starring jean arthur, eric blore, and james gleason. it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed. though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple, the actor made a couple of other "thin man" type movies, one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur, both to very good effect.somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty, debonair professional and "the ex-mrs. bradford" is no exception. the ex-mrs. b has mr. b served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into. and this isn't the first time she's done that! it almost seems as though there was a "bradford" film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - mr. b complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases. this time, a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line.the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point. the point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-mrs. b. jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny. however, with an actress who comes off as brainy as arthur does, the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained. i suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, the wacky side of carole lombard. when arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "ah, it's probably about my alimony. i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it," it's more of a rib to powell rather than a serious statement. it still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own.definitely worth watching, as william powell and jean arthur always were.

i've seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great, but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthur's chemistry in this flick. jean arthur shines when she looks at powell. there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them. this film may not have the wit of the thin man series, but undeniably makes up for it in charm. while i watched it, i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur. my friends thought the same. this is one film where i wish i could step back in time (to schmooze and lock lips with powell!) there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! powell's character, lawrence bradford, is probably the closest thing to the "perfect man." okay, this is sounding way too gushy, but i can't help myself.

rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia, for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man. they succeeded to some degree.a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles, bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role. so by this time he was pretty well set in the role. doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles, but the basic blasé nick is still there. one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress, doctor bradford works for a living as a physician. that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film.he's got two murders to solve. a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason. the trainer suspects something afoot, but he's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet. this is after he comes to bill powell for help.myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was. arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did. but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry.the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene/nat pendleton role. all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell's butler was essaying that part.if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films.

the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. they are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler.powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films, the canary murder case and the greene murder case, both in the philo vance series.

by the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over, as films were moving in a different direction, comedically and otherwise. with television looming on the horizon, hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. where, one wonders, would movies have gone had television not come along, or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? mr. blandings builds his dream house offers one particular way comedy might have developed.ad man jim blandings, along with his wife and two daughters, are living in a nice but way too cramped new york city apartment, as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. so he buys some property in connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. well, almost. had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. then again he might not have. you decide. on this frail premise a wonderful film results, full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. nothing comes easy in this life, as mr. blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. there is, after all, the long run. but, blandings asks himself every few minutes, how long is long?this movie is a delight. it is not, i suppose, a masterpiece in the capra-mccarey tradition, but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures, and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. there is real warmth in the picture, and a good deal of (w.c.) fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically, but not so much as to leave a bad taste. the people in the film are all very smart and affluent, but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.lead players cary grant and myrna loy plays mr. and mrs. blandings to perfection; while melvyn douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend, who often has to bring up unpleasant topics, such as how the real world works. there is, too, a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia, which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years, as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. these people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural connecticut. in a few short years things would change, as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear, destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns, which soon would be connected by highways, littered with bottles and cans, their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city.

i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv.the one scene that always stands out, for me that is, is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman, where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says "did you get that, that's yellow, blue, green and white"

this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud. in other places, i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious, politically correct prigs. there is neither here, unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid.the lines are hilarious, and all the leads have never been better. melvin douglas is especially brilliant.if you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house, you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel, you are not alone!

great acting, great movie. if you are thinking of building see this movie first. the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same. the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt.

i first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot. after many subsequent viewings (and purchase of the video) it still makes me laugh out loud.yes, it's a relic of another age - a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america - but well executed is well executed. but it's also a document of its age - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the nascent consumer age. this film is no "guilty" pleasure.three wonderful sophisticated leads actors - urbane melvyn douglas; bemused cary grant; daffily determined myrna loy - complement each other and a memorable team of characters.my favourite scenes - "it means we gotta blast" and "miss stellwaggen" and "this little piggy".love it.

i stopped short of giving "mr. blandings builds his dream house" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit). but other than that, the movie's a hoot. portraying middle class new york couple jim (cary grant) and muriel blandings (myrna loy) trying to build a house in connecticut, this flick has something for everyone.grant is his usual flippant self, while loy does quite well as merely a wife. but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim's and muriel's lawyer bill cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear. as for the house itself...throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there. the builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs.all in all, a comedy classic. also starring louise beavers, reginald denny, sharyn moffett, connie marshall and jason robards sr.

modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake, "the money pit." older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: cary grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas were all "superstars" in an easier, less complicated era. or was it? time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. in "mr. blandings builds his dream house," there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948. there is political commentary, however subtle. finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like. politics in the movie? the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would get teachers accused of communism). in real life, too, myrna loy was a housing activist, a democrat, and a feminist. melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas, whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism (and which ruined her). jason robards, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. more importantly, his son, jason robards, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal democrat. almost the odd fellow out was cary grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping. but this was 1948: communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly.

although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built (or bought) to your specifications, it is not the first, nor the last. in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s. kaufman and moss hart. and about fifteen years ago shelly long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit. the former was about moving into an 18th century country house that...err, needs work. the latter was about building your dream house - in the late 1980s. although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as blandings, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name.jim blandings and his wife muriel (cary grant and myrna loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters joan and betsy (sharyn moffett and connie marshall). although blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he is making $15,000.00 a year, which was like making $90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxury apartment - which in the new york city of that day he rents! - he feels they should seek something better. he and muriel take a drive into the country (connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want.and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to. for one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to heed warning after warning by their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole (melvin douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). for example, jim buys land from a connecticut dealer (ian wolfe, sucking his chops quietly), with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of connecticut. bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth. there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the zis - zis water softening machine. they find that the designs they have in mind, and have worked out with their architect (reginald denny), can't be dropped cheaply at a spur of the moment decision by muriel to build a little rookery that nobody planned for. the escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils jim. he has been appointed to handle the "wham" account ("spam" had become a popular result of world war ii, in that the public started using it as a meat substitute, in the light of it's success with the armed forces). jim can't get a grip on this (he's not alone - one or two other executives fumbled it before him). he comes up with the following bit of "poetry"(?):"this little piggy went to market,he was pink and as pretty as ham.he smiled in his tracks,as they gave him the ax -he knew he would end up as "wham"!"his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one!jim also is increasingly suspicious of the attentions of bill to muriel, although (in this case) bill is blameless. but he's always around (jim keeps forgetting that bill is the clearheaded one, and that he's keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes). all three have mishaps, the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house, just as the men have left for the day. they can't open the door, and jim (in a panic) tries breaking the door down by a make-shift battering ram. he breaks a window, and the door opens by itself.the film works quite satisfactorily, with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves. it is one film which (despite changing price levels and salary levels) really does not age at all. after all, most americans dream of owning their own home and always have.a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and emory parnell regarding the paint job parnell's company has to do on the various rooms. she carefully shows the distinct shades of red, blue, etc. she wants - even giving a polite parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue. the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. they proudly called loy "mrs. blandings" in the commercials' introduction. you can imagine though how the no-nonsense parnell handles the situation afterward, when loy leaves him with his paint crew.

liked stanley & iris very much. acting was very good. story had a unique and interesting arrangement. the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing. characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. very enjoyable movie.

- having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of new york city, jim blandings (cary grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children. he's hoping to find the simple life. but, building a house proves to be anything but simple. as the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs. will mr. blanding's ever get his dream house? - what makes this movie so special is the three main actors - grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas. any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. he is so good at playing the put upon husband. loy is a always a joy to watch. the thin man films she made with william powell are near perfect. and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years. douglas also appeared in the old dark house, a particular favorite of mine.- the movie is definitely a product of its time. i get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year. throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful.- however, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today. and that's where the comedy comes in. how many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - the biggest complaint i have about mr. blandings is the whole "wife in love with best friend" subplot. it's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented.

while the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie. i know i did.mr. blandings, a new york ad executive, decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there. he gets into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties, as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control. i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water. they dig down hundreds of feet, but never find water. yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house-to-be floods!cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and melvyn douglas is even better as blanding's lawyer and family friend.the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. mrs. blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horrors!). so don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more.

in manhattan, the american middle class jim blandings (cary grant) lives with his wife muriel (myrna loy) and two teenage daughters in a four bedroom and one bathroom only leased apartment. jim works in an advertising agency raising us$ 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to the lack of space. when he sees an advertisement of a huge house for sale in the country of connecticut for an affordable price, he drives with his wife and the real estate agent and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. his best friend and lawyer bill cole (melvyn douglas) sends an acquaintance engineer to inspect the house, and the man tells that he should put down the house and build another one. jim checks the information with other engineers and all of them condemn the place and sooner he finds that he bought a "money pit" instead of a dream house."mr. blandings builds his own house" is an extremely funny comedy, with witty lines and top-notch screenplay. cary grant is hilarious in the role of a man moved by the impulse of accomplishing with the american dream of owning a huge house that finds that made bad choice, while losing his touch in his work and feeling jealous of his friend. in 1986, tom hanks worked in a very funny movie visibly inspired in this delightful classic, "the money pit". my vote is eight.title (brazil): "lar, meu tormento" ("home, my torment")

this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film! the plot is somewhat lacking, but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference. this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please. as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining; and with major stars like cary grant, myrna loy, and melvyn douglas... how could you go wrong? comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued, and is very difficult to imitate. a good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film: the money pit, with tom hanks and shelley long. despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments. achieving true comedic dialog is an art.

the film opens with bill coles (melvyn douglas) telling a story about how his best friend--make that client--jim blandings (cary grant) and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment, with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms. when jim's wife, muriel (myrna loy), wants to renovate the apartment, advertising exec jim falls in love with (or falls for!) an ad for a house. once he's purchased the house, bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jim's 'dream house' goes wrong.one of three collaborations between grant and loy, this is a charming little comedy--not very taxing, with no real great message, but a great way to spend an hour or two. the laughs are there right from the start, when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off, only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel. the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros, and that's just what grant and loy give us: polished performances, simple chemistry, and a lot of fun. myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role (it's evident that grant's character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting, and grant, as always, pulls both off with remarkable aplomb), but she gives muriel a colour, life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character. melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well, never hitting a single wrong note.one of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the 'store room', and jim goes to 'save' him... only to get everyone trapped inside! every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for 'wham'--seems to bring together everything that *could* go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch. 8/10

manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences. the worst one is the lack of closet space! some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!melvin frank and norman panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in eric hodgins novel, whose hero, jim blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel, and two daughters, must share.jim blandings, a madison ave. executive, has had it! when he sees an ad for connecticut living, he decides to take a look. obviously, a first time owner, jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. this is only the beginning of his problems.whatever could be wrong, goes wrong. the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed. as one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford.the film is fun because of the three principals in it. cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings. myrna loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr. grant. the third character, bill cole, an old boyfriend of myrna, turned lawyer for the blandings, is suave and debonair, the way melvin douglas portrayed him. one of the blandings girls, joan, is played by sharyn moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint. the great louise beavers plays gussie, but doesn't have much to do.the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better. the direction of h.c. potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.

i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was well written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.

the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's "i'll take you there" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (shelly has acted in two of hartley's films). not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank god), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, "i'll see you there" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces. not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home, but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat. all washed up, bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy (played by the director adrienne shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a "date" for her traumatized brother.the unwilling bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice. no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to "rebound" with her. however, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. to what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy?)aware that bill desperately wants to see rose, bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. on the way, she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun (a pinkerton detective, no less). an imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose... of course, with a few stops along the way.

this movie is wonderful. the writing, directing, acting all are fantastic. very witty and clever script. quality performances by actors, ally sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky. really original and heart-warmingly unpredicatable. the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production.

i too have gone thru very painful personal loss (twice) and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well, life out of balance, nothing makes sense, well meaning relatives, etc...it was nice to see ally again. she is one of my all time favorite movie actors.i laughed and cried as the story unfolded. great story and cast. well done!

real cool, smart movie. i loved sheedy's colors, especially the purple car. alice drummond is wise and wonderful as stella. i liked sheedy's reference to how her face had gotten fatter. the roadside dance scene is brilliant. really liked this one.

i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne's "waitress" (2007). this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie. adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. male lead reg rodgers, looking like judd nelson, is fine. there is also a great cameo by ben vereen. the song at the end of the movie "the bastard song" written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: "it's a world of suffering,in a sea of pain,no matter how much sun you bring,you're pummeled by the rain...don't let the heartless get you down,don't greet the heartless at your door,don't live among the heartless"

"i'll take you there" tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly tongue-in-cheek situational comedy featuring rogers and sheedy with little emphasis on romance. a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving, stays fresh, and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers.

this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one. this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film. at first, the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves, even if grudgingly, through each other. rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread. hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt.

the title has many meanings - the boxing ring, where differences and grievances are fought out, a wedding ring, where mabel feels trapped and jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble, a ring-like bracelet that bill gives mabel as a love token. former professional boxer, danish carl brisson, was given his start in films by alfred hitchcock in "the ring". a very young ian hunter, who went on to have such a long career in movies, plays bob corby, who catches the eye of a pretty girl, mabel (lillian hall davis) at a fun fair. she happens to be engaged to "one round" jack sander (carl brisson) but that doesn't stop her flirting with bob. bob is persuaded to go "one round" with jack. he goes several rounds and wins - he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if jack is as good a fighter as they have heard. he offers to take jack on and jack goes off, along with his boorish trainer (the great gordon harker) to make his fortune with plans to marry mabel when he makes good. jack wins his fight and marries mabel the next day, but the deep attraction that she and bob feel for each other is still there. jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight bob for his wife.at last a boxing movie where the hero doesn't go off the rails - bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion - if only mabel acted in the same way!!! she has left him for bob - and the fight at the end is a mighty one. it is intensely realistic - it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film. from being raw and enthusiastic, jack is almost knocked out - then between rounds, reuniting with mabel, gives him the courage to triumph. the question is why would he even want her back - from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with bob - why wouldn't she do it again?the film is loaded with symbolism. jack, shaking hands with the promoter, changes to mabel's hands accepting a bracelet from bob. when jack puts the ring on mabel's finger, bobs bracelet slips down her arm. at the end jack sees mabel's reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on. this is an excellent film that will not disappoint you.highly recommended.

'one-round' jack sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. if they can last one round, they win a prize--a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago. jack is in love with the ticket girl, mabel, though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack. what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ, so he's able to beat jack--though it takes him some work. as a result, bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. later, jack improves so much that he, too, becomes a legitimate boxer. slowly, he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the champ.in the meantime, the champ and mabel start running around behind jack's back--even though by now mabel has married jack. so, when the final fight occurs between jack and bob, it's very personal and jack is ready to kill him. is he good enough? will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance? tune in and see.this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films, back in the 1920s, hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). in fact, in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents, the manxman (also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband). so, while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending.overall, while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly, the film works well. while far from a perfect silent, it's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch.

another silent love triangle film from hitchcock, not a mystery, but very english, very well-paced and photographed. smooth boxer bob corby (ian hunter) recruits circus boxer "one round" jack sander (carl brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the pretty but fickle mabel (lilian hall-davis) nearby. there are lots of character actors and grotesquesat jack and mabel's wedding the verger, standing in the aisle of the church, registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men, the fat lady, the conjoined twins who, of course, argue about which side of the aisle to sit, and the wedding feast is amusing. the rest of the movie has jack losing mabel and boxing his way back to her heart, or something like that. it was another era altogether, with the audience in evening dress, and the boxers dressing up, too, when out of the ring. the camera angles, the pace, the use of symbols, the cuttingall very stylish and masterful. the camera-work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping. brisson's good looks are well-used in this one; his smiling is not so oblivious of what's going on around him as he is in hitchcock's the manxman, and so is not annoying. but can boxers have such dimples?

hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film. the plot of the film, involving two boxers fighting over a girl, is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it. hitchcock's talent, though, is found in his stunning use of images. nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols. especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know. the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was. the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. the object of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust, not reason or love. the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships. all in all, the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock's early work and his development as a visual storyteller.

i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films, because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc. so, that being said, i would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc.now, that may be overshooting a little bit, the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above, but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them. as an almost brand new director, there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.granted, the film does start with, among other things, the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer (and i use idiot in the definitive manner, the way stephen king so often does) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people. i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then, but i think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any hitchcock film i've seen.the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round, but when he meets his match, it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger. so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman, who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.(spoilers) there is, for example, a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and, just before going into the building, she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss. this kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband, or at least ultimately chooses him, they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss.the film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years. there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack's trainer who, in his stone faced expressionism, reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton. hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous, but this is a great sample of his early work.

this early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. it's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.its core, though, remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is very well entwined with the progress of the match. the inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). the pacing becomes astonishingly rapid, and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.the only dvd release with which i am familiar is that of laserlight, a public domain company. as with each hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. the sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.this is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. it deserves an honorable place in both the hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.

surprisingly good early effort from alfred hitchcock. one of the only original screenplays written by hitchcock himself, this film shows remarkable story structure. it kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ "one round" jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter. the movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between jack, his girl and the professional boxer. the rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men, this time for the heavyweight crown. even in this early film, hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement. an armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness. the only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927. the final match, as a result, ends up being somewhat anticlimactic. the story, though, is what carries this film through.

at first, i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with it's ordinary plot. how surprised was i! of course, the plot is simple - one girl is in love with two men - but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair, the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men, the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies(north by northwest, the rope, etc.). the master did it great even before his thirties!

the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals, as many of his earliest pictures do, with a love triangle. at first glance, it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity-themed morality comedies of cecil b. de mille, but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture. even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers, he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense.as well as being a student of the german expressionist style, the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock. but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery. this is apparent from the opening shots, where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo. and like eisenstein, the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split-second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in, we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring.there is also a contrast, particularly with silent films from the us, in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards. as much as possible is conveyed by imagery, and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip-read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters' speech. and it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting, it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing, particularly with point-of-view shots, as well as some strong yet subtle performances. there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices (particularly double exposures), many of which were unnecessary, but there is far less of this than there is in the lodger.let's make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors. first up, the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role. in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role, as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist! but that just goes to show how much i know, as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting. playing his rival is the competent ian hunter, who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s. the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian hall-davis, torn between two lovers. she pulls it off very well however with an emotive, understated performance, and it's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era. and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role.the ring's climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent-era hitchcock. martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull, as his watchword for these scenes was "stay inside the ring". the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots, but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it, with close-ups and point-of-view shots. hitchcock's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience, and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character's fear or paranoia.the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger. it's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture, and probably the best of all his silent features.

the symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. even the title has a least four meanings that i can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet the lover buys, and the love triangle at the heart of the story.

terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt, good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines, well acted and well cast, tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion

very entertaining, and a great cast as noted. i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also, as is usually the case. worth renting if you can find it, which has proved difficult for me. also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name.

tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud. the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself.there are a few surprises. as cynical as we are today, i fully expected the 'good girl' to be crying over his grave, instead of his buddy's. especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend', when she first meets matt. and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr. allen's face, blinding him (interesting role by bruce dern). wrrrooonnnnggg!!! some of the other hollywood endings do happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting so carefully wrought that you're blissfully unaware.and the music is out of this world. taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley. even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago, but at a club called, wonderfully, 'biloxi' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks. i'll be watching it again, just to hear the music. good thing i have the factotum sound track, so i can listen to that in the car. watch both together, and you'll see how matt has matured....playing bar room characters in both. now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc, he probably has great opportunity to do his studies. great actor, just coming into his own. he shows finely nuanced performances ...the good and the bad in his characters. his 'young boy off the farm' is a great study, made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes. he makes love, convincingly as well. since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager, i wonder how that it ...making love to an actress you kinda grew up with. adds conviction, i'll say that.

considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film. the acting for the most part is great, although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best. however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent.

what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be. this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages. particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago, which i still keep thinking about. the back cover doesn't do this film justice, it's superb, and in my top-5 for sure.

this movie is a ripoff of james cain's novel, the postman always rings twice. apparently, the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties! despite this, the movie isn't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie. in some ways it's a lot better and in other ways, it is definitely not.the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. in fact, the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking. the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair (particularly on the back and shoulders) and his lady love is, to put it frankly, unattractive. they are a very, very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version. and the ill-fated husband is really, really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the american film, cecil kellaway is definitely better looking (and probably better looking than the other two italian leads, actually). and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film--since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed "dish" like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway--i am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! whereas, the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable.part of the italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway, they never actually get around to sex! this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. in addition to the casual sexuality of the film, it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people, a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath.the movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long american film. and what you get due to brevity isn't all good. the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film--with grainier footage, relatively poor orchestration and sets. it sure ain't a pretty film, but the neo-realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic. but it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot. many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over. and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats (the best part of the american film).so which is the better film? well, a lot of this probably depends on you. as for me, the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic (though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles)--but it packed a great ending. and the italian film was much, much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed. so neither film is exactly great, but i'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better. it's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film.

the ruth snyder - judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal. more famously, it inspired james m. cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - double indemnity and the postman always rings twice. both became film noir classics of the 1940's, double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made. some of the real-life elements of the snyder-gray story were captured by cain - the old age and indifference of albert gray, ruth's high sex drive, ruth and judd's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause. missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan - albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor. the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase.cain's double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder - let's ignore stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore! the postman always rings twice, however, was filmed thrice and ossessione, an italian version and luchino visconti's first film, was the first of three versions. before commenting on it, i'll recommend the lana turner - john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson - jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table.ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice. it has a strong neo-realist look which makes it a great movie, but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing. it does not have low-key lighting and unconventional camera angles. the dialog is not hard-boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization. this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization. its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version. we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac. a new character is introduced into the story - la spagnola - with very obvious homosexual overtones. there is also a small, but very well-played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute.this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime. the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime. the drifter is a complete tramp, the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage. her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese, rude and arrogant. i think the casting was brilliant for this film. my only beef is with the overlong running time. everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical. nevertheless, fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione, as i did.

well, i'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre, and particular favourite of mine, the 'giallo'...but actually, aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy; the two have pretty much no relation. in the sixties and seventies, italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released. they've not done that here, but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film 'the postman always rings twice', without giving the book's author, james m. cain, so much as a credit! anyway, the plot focuses on gino costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a café where a woman named giovanna bragana works. he soon learns that she's married to giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom giovanna can't stand to have even touching her. he wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea. however, fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful...despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on, it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well, and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics. the story is, as you would expect, extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast. visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost 135 minutes, i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length. i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film, but it's not a 'great' film. the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly, and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads. there's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been. still, it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason...although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m. cain classic.

ossessioneluchino visconti's debut film, this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. set in fascist italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. although visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. all the same, it's incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.

audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out. the structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements. it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light. films of this naturethe neo-realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-world war ii times. ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc. aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments, the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty: shot on-location, uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors. all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film, yielding the following theme: negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally.the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites, yet both carry the mentality: we're bored and we want to be entertained. gino is a drifter; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations. giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence: she doesn't want to leave her home and husband, but would rather remain where she is because it's safer. gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves; the only difference is that she's too afraid to live it herselfthat's why she falls in love with gino: he represents everything she wants but doesn't have the courage to get. she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world. the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40's feeling somewhat uneasy. i mean, films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before. to say the least it was probably a bit alarming.in conjunction with the theme, the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior. succinctly put, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives. when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to "eliminate" giovanna's husband, karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done. they return to their home: the atmosphere is dark and biting (as can be expected from the neo-realist style). they are not happy; they're actually more depressed. they thought that by eliminating giovanna's husband that they'd live happier lives, but they were duped. the film ends with giovanna's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband's death. i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons. here's why.there's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen, and if so, to what extent. i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified, but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have. as the subtext of ossessione asks, is adultery and murder evil? i think the film eagerly responds yes! the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are. ironically though, towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other's arms inside the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness is, in fact, a façade: the car crashes off the cliff and into the river, killing giovanna; the police arrest gino. i think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them. i agree. i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times. this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship: he can't handle the pressure of living in giovanna's husband shadow, so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl. such is typical of the insatiable, hedonistic personality.all in all, the film seemed very risky for its time. the audience, however, was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought. those pre-war, happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed. movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters: they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin' because it was a reflection of their own life problems. ossessione, then, acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading. that is, a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement.

oh, those sneaky italians. it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. james m. cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless. this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment.leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.nevertheless, i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. it's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies.8/10

visconti's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique, accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and, best of all, clara calamai as the fabulous, frantic giovanna. remade several times as 'the postman rings twice' but never bettered. can't believe this was the man's first film! it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career.

i'm not sure under what circumstances director visconti decided to film james cain's novel "the postman always rings twice" (i'm not even sure if viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. it is not the best version of cain's story (i like the 1981 version best), but thanks to visconti's excellent direction and the casting of clara calamai and massimo girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. the film is not perfect, though. my main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (i don't think visconti was very good at editing his films). i think film noir works better with a short running time. fortunately, calamai and girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. anyhow, as much as i like this film and the remakes, i think no one has made the definitive version of cain's much-praised book.

when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama, they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic, melancholic roles. this opinion, however, does not resemble neorealist movies, in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti. ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others. the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself, exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past. at the same time, while being based on the novel by james m. cain, the postman always rings twice, it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style, view, his own art. i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to entail below.first, visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life, in particular those absorbed by desire. these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face. gino (massimo girotti) a traveler with "bear like shoulders" turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern. although many people go there to have a meal, gino occurs to get something more - much more: the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna (clara calamai) a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar, mr giuseppe bragana (juan de landa). her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love, the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together... however, are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire? can one build love upon murder? what is love and what is loyalty? does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession? such questions intensely arise while watching the movie, when, to the core, the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters. "we have to love each other affectionately" answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything? "isn't it what we both wanted" says one of the couple... it occurs that it's not. therefore, the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart. yet, it constantly remains thought provoking.second, ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers: brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography, which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power. these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch. they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots. who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl, a sort of "ragazza perfetta" (perfect girl), a dancer anita and buys her ice cream. his desires show him totally different direction... do viewers remain indifferent at gino-giovanna's first meeting? the first focus of camera is on giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences. a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look.third, ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast. massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done; yet, consequently, what comes out is a flawless acting. he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim, which represents conscience. his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo (elio marcuzzo) whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona. clara calamai, who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused, fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple. they are both very convincing. besides, i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana: he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art. in some of his most witty moments, he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance.in sum, we, as modern viewers who are capable of critical view, have to look at this film very objectively. it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned, it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries; yet, is it educational? visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity. in such case, his films would only entertain (which is, of course, not entirely fellini's style, too). visconti always had something to convey. what did he want to say here? is the film against bad marriage? or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire? the final shocking moments say for themselves. though you don't have to agree with the vision, ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film, one of visconti's best 8/10

a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe: an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter, but still has an ace up her sleeve: beauty and youth. bragana, a fat-bellied gas station tenant, who has been getting on in years, picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection. but the physical contact that giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust, and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of.the arrival of gino, a young migrant worker, finally provides her the longed-for opportunity. and you don't have to ask her twice: at the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired, and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance.the developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by giovanna though. gino's yearning for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside. giovanna aims at another goal: to get bragana killed, to inherit and, in addition to that, to collect the insurance premium. in her hands gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool. being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold-blooded killer.but in contrast to giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level. the very taking over of bragana's place, which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man, causes a deep loathing of himself. and later, after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through giovanna's cunningly devised plan, he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute.if visconti's film ended at this point, it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. but then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse. at last giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done, and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew gino's love. her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. it also affects us, while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster. the culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start.

to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track, not only the music, but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery. how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside giovanna's marriage. don't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in 1943. that's not what this is about. on the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism. by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. this is one of my favorite visconti films.

tcm is keeping me awake all the time... they keep coming up with films ive never heard of ... senso.... now ossessione... a very early film by visconti!!... wow... the italian version of the postman always rings twice...brilliant!! beautifully acted and directed ...never heard of either leads who were excellent, clara calamai,as giovanna, and especially, massimo girotti as gino... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943!!! his look was ahead of its time...many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him... he should have been a major world wide star!! the film is much better than the jack nicholson/jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version (which i really like) with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit ? who can forget.... this italian version is different ..more realistic and with a very different ending... see it watch it...im going to buy it !!

a masterful treatment of james caine's "the postman always rings twice" as luchino visconti's first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy. the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe" (1941), star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. unusual ending in which, although crime does not pay, one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. excellent direction, script, acting, and cinematography. reportedly not as good as the french "le dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the us version (1946) featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles. highly recommended.

this is a really fun movie. one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more funny. sally field, teri hatcher (in her hey-day), kevin klein, elisabeth shue, robert downey, jr...it's all these well-known, quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars/producers. if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought, "how on earth did they come up with this idea??", you will love this movie. i have seen it multiple times; and each time i watch it, the more i appreciate the humor, the more i realize just how well-acted it really is. don't expect oscar quality. this is a fun movie to entertain, not some artsy attempt at finding "man's inner man", etc. sit back, relax, and laugh.

ossessione, adapted loosely (or if it is as loose or close to the version i saw of james m. cain's the postman always rings twice with jack nicholson and jessica lange i can't be certain) by first time director luchino visconti, is no less outstanding with usage of mis-en-scene, music (both diegetic and non-diegetic), and the acting. i didn't know what to expect visconti to do in his approach to the material, after seeing la terra trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit. but this is a totally character and emotional based drama, bordering on melodrama (however, without the conventions that bog down lesser ones), and with the style in the finest path of the budding film-noir movement, visconti creates a debut that's as involving as any other neo-realist film. neo-realism, by the way, could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather (along with de sica's the children are watching us), which that would take shape after the war. although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo-realist efforts, it's dealt with in a bare-bones storytelling fashion, and it's laced with other familiar themes in neo-realism (the lower-class, death, desperation).aside from the story, which is simply as it is described on this site, the artistry with which visconti captures the images, and then layers them with objects (a shawl over gino costa's profile when in guilt), shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film (usually over gian and giovanna), and the feel of the italian streets in many of the exterior scenes. domenico scala and aldo tonti (who would lens some of rossellini and fellini's films) help in envisioning the look of ossessione, which is usually moving in on a character, then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces, their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly, sad and dark and romantic. i think i've just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along, even as i was in fear of the futures of the two leads. the two leads (massimo girotti and clara calamai) portray all the compelling, truthful, and near-operatic emotions, and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes. it's a brilliant, crushing adaptation, and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for visconti in his career.

fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini. street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching. combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again . .. and maybe again.

ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen. the material used is a "master positive" 2nd generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists. it has been scanned on the spirit 4k (as 2k rgb data) then processed using davinci revival restoration software. after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring. sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd. this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.

gino costa (massimo girotti) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar. he meets the young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana (clara calamai) and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana (juan de landa), owners of the bar. he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging, and has an affair with giovanna. they both decide to kill giuseppe, forging a car accident. the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police. this masterpiece ends in a tragic way. the noir and neo-realistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding. this is the first time that i watch this version of `the postman always rings twice'. i loved the 1946 version with lana turner, and the 1981 version, where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema, but this one is certainly the best. my vote is ten.

wow! the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances. absolutely incredible! if this was visconti's debut film, i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film. the only other one of his i've seen (at time of writing) is death in venice - which was absolutely incredible: more dazzling visually than ossessione (obsession). one of the most beautiful films i've ever seen, but its story was not as involving as ossessione. if you click on "miscellaneous" on this page's links, there are stills from the movie on those websites. they won't really do justice to the experience of the movie: such graceful camera movements, such beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such terrific characters, such a great story development, the first movie adapted from james m cain's "the postman always rings twice."i can't believe this was made in 43, eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire (1951). the actors in this may not have used the method technique, ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves (i don't know anything about it) - but they're some of the best, most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema. also, eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen, ossessione was electrifyingly sensual! the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema! yes, i'm being superlative, but ossessione was just that terrific.the reason ossessione didn't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini, and re-cut in america. american audiences didn't see its full glory till 59, eight years after streetcar.i won't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best, most beautiful and exciting movies i've ever seen, and tell you to go out and see it! like another reviewer, i'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it!

luchino visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. the great directors of italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium, but it was luchino visconti, a man of vision, who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing. he clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with "ossessione", a film based on james cain's "the postman always ring twice", which was later made by hollywood, but that version pales in comparison with what visconti achieved in the movie. luchino visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited alberto moravia, a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings.the film has been well preserved in the dvd format we watched recently. the film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way, something the american version lacked.what comes across watching the movie, is the intensity which the director got from his key players. the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna, the woman who has married an older man, but when gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life. giovanna is one of the best creations in ms. calamai's achievements in the italian cinema. the last sequence of the film shows ms. calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed.equally excellent is massimo girotti, one of the best actors of his generation who appears as gino, the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in giovanna. gino is the perfect man for giovanna, something that mr. girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen. mr. girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy, yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent. juan delanda is seen as giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with giovanna. in fact, his character rings truer than his counterpart in the american film, where he is seen more as a buffoon.the film is beautifully photographed by domenic scala and aldo tonti. they gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way italian directors of the era favored. the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect. visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes arias by bizet and verdi that fit well in the context of the movie."ossessione" is a film to treasure because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form.

(some spoilers) i have not read the james m. cain novel (`the postman always rings twice') on which this movie was based, so i cannot compare this film version to it, but i have seen and love the 1946 us version (also entitled `postman').even better is this gem from italy, which, i have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime. well, no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making. one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, hanging heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life.consider gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless.in giovanna, he sees a way out, yet he should have kept going, as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex. in the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner (giuseppe bregana, played by juan de landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy. she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her.on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which he has in fact pocketed), gino wins bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life, or lack thereof) and is left alone with giovanna. they immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair.gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband. wanting no part of it, gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named spagnolo, a fellow train passenger. to gino, spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (spagnolo also symbolizes gino's morality and conscience), traveling and finding work at a carnival together. finally gino has steady employment. to his dismay (he is not yet over his love for giovanna), a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as he is handy to have around.too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite he and giovanna, gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple. after a while he gives in to gina's demands to get rid of her husband. once the evil deed is done, giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm. as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences.i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story.while the '46 u.s. version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone. this gives the final outcome even more potency, and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live.a minor quibble: the amount of time (hardly any) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the u.s. version); gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met!  all rather unrealistic, isn't it? i found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere. otherwise, well worth the viewer's time. the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout. recommended.

visconti's first feature, ossessione is an adaptation of james m. cain's the postman always rings twice. now, i'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions, but i am a big fan of cain's double indemnity (much more so than i am a fan of billy wilder's film version of it, in fact). the two novellas seem like they must be very similar. both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her. giovanna, the woman in this italian version, played very well by clara calamai, is not evil incarnate like the wife in double indemnity, but she seems very spoiled. her husband (a great performance by juan de landa) is a bit cruel to her, but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him. he's older than her and unattractive, so she's rather fickle. when gino shows up, a young, muscular man, it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed. she sweats she wants to be with him forever, but she's stuck with her husband. they break up at first, but when they meet again, they (apparently, although this is intentionally vague) plan to murder the husband. they are successful, and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned. gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea. he wants giovanna, but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life. their relationship quickly crumbles. ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters. it's always fascinating, but it does go on a bit too long. at two hours and twenty-two minutes, i can't, for the life of me, figure out how it took that long! this is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that visconti was inventing within this film. it was, after all, the first film that won that label. we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life, without any hurrying to the next plot point. i've seen many of visconti's films, and the only one i like better than this one is rocco and his brothers (1960). his direction is as great as it ever was, with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect. i also feel the need to point out the film's best performance, by dhia christiani as a young (exotic) dancer and part-time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna. she's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes, and she has only a few lines. it's shocking how much visconti and christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time. she's absolutely heartbreaking. 9/10.

this is a haunting, powerful italian adaptation of james m. cain's novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti. what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it's source material to become something bolder and more original (interestingly camus also credits cain's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger). the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender. cain's very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness (the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant), which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in. this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate, doomed love affair of the two main characters. this film is a complex, suspenseful, rewarding experience.

watching "ossessione" today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience, especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever (roughly from "ossessione" and de sica's "i bambini ci guardano", both 1943, up to 20 years later with fellini, antonioni, pasolini). visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of "the postman always rings twice" as a guide to the development of his own themes.it strikes us even today how ahead of its time "ossessione" was. shot in fascist italy during world war ii (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn't help. "ossessione" alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time italy (far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist "telefoni bianchi" movies); but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk gino (massimo girotti, who definitely precedes brando's kowalski in "a streetcar named desire") taking giovanna (clara calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. we watch calamai's unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo (elio marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike pierre clémenti's, who was shot by the nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...in a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in italian cinema.all the copies of "ossessione" were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the neo-realist movement, preceding rossellini's "roma città aperta" and de sica's "sciuscià". some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw "ossessione" as the italian counterpart to the "poetic realism" of french cinema (remember visconti had been renoir's assistant), especially marcel carné's "quai des brumes" and "le jour se lève", and julien duvivier's "pépé le moko". while "ossessione" may be neo-realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian. he was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, "everyday- life" characters and themes, favored by desica and rossellini. in "ossessione" we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially "senso" (visconti's definitive departure from neo-realist aesthetics) and "rocco e suoi fratelli"...even in his most "neo-realist" film, "la terra trema", he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures."ossessione" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. "ossessione" is not to be missed: you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.

its hollywood imitating daytiem soap operas at its finest! its the fun that we never see. great characters and great lines. whoopi is hilarious.....sally field is so over the top....gary marshalls lines are a riot....this is what i love about good comedies. never afraid to poke fun at themselves!!!!!!the sets were great....wardrobe was on point and the backstabbing "montana morehead" was a devilish delight. terri hatcher as "dr. monica demonico" didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen. i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up. never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work! soapdish is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd!!!

this is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife, daughter, and i found it irresistible. the plot is just crazy but "rings true" to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities. i particularly enjoyed kevin kline's and sally field's performances. i don't anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded. field's character's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation -- and her almost bipolar swings in mood -- played nicely against the background of field's famous (infamous?) "you like me!" oscar exclamation. people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world. i think this is the only movie where i didn't find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization; i thought she was "spot on" in every note she struck. robert downey jr., teri hatcher, cathy moriarty, and elizabeth shue were also first-rate as well. just a great movie if you're in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh!

the only part lacking in this movie is shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her "aunt's" footsteps as a daytime soap star. otherwise it would be a perfect 10.it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - i have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts. it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you.it's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once. i'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose.you'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely, 'nurse nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you.if you love daytime soaps or despise them, this move pokes fun in all the right places.

i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out, and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun. this is a great cast of characters, many big names in it, a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now. i think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watched list. some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well-done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue, kind of odd spontaneous-appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors. the movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of a daytime soap.

i'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but i'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie.i adore this movie, and so does everyone i work with -- and that is the point. i spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama! possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out-of-script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance.since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on tv. but hardly anyone has done it so well.

it's very very funny. you know, just like a comedy is supposed to be. it also looks very very good, like a hollywood spectacular should. so, what more do you want? howz about a very very good sally fields. she is so much better here than in anything else i've ever seen her in, and she looks so damn good. this movie is all you need to understand why she's a star. those eyes! like a silent movie star, but better. in fact, everyone's eyes are so good. i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend. we'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner. they don't do that at all in soap dish. great. the eyes have it! (sorry) there's so many terrific performances, its fun just waiting for each of them to reappear. there's a whole workshop going on with kevin kline on how to overact very very subtly. got that? yeah, he's damn good. so is robert downey, jr. who has since made sumthin of a career of playing the slick, slimy executive. cathy moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and riveting, especially when she's angry. and even whoopi goldberg is decent, her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little zing. ok, no whoopi bashing, i hear ya.and then, there's the hair. soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties, so the ridiculous doos are like a great character in themselves. they get bigger and sillier, just like your's did. yeah, we got pictures.soap dish is better than i thought it'd be, better that i wanted it to be. i'm sick of movies that tell me i'm supposed to care about shallow, self centered, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie. tv soap actors. soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em. thank you.

when i was a kid of 8, i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to, and this was one of them. it's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life, the acting is excellent, they don't make comedies like this anymore these days (movies that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit-inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non-actors like seth rogen, barf).this movie is a classic with actors who can actually act, and deserve all the accolades.

although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe gene kelly, and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff, you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show. in american in paris, he choreographs some outstanding numbers, some which stall the plot, but are nonetheless amazing to look at. (check out gene kelly's "getting out of bed routine" for starters)gene kelly stars as a gi who is based out of paris, he stayed there to paint, soon he is a rich woman's gigolo, but he really loves someone else! hoary story sure, but the musical numbers save the show here! i really loved georges gu¨¦tary's voice work in this one. his 'stairway to paradise' and his duet with le gene on 's wonderful' is 's marvelous'. oscar levant and leslie caron i can take or leave. all in all, a pretty good, but not dynamite movie.

the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end, where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters. kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris, so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy, gershwin tunes, and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant. kelly was at his best here - it's a little different to singin' in the rain, and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. no wonder the sequence ended 'that's entertainment' after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by!

what makes for best picture material? the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly, and ignoring the "auteurs" who would be deified in decades to come. it wasn't because hollywood was against art or creativity. the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself, and that is why, at least in the classic era, they tended to reward the greatest collaborations, the most sensational meetings of creative minds.the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar-winning glory for several years by this point; it was only a matter of time before freed, aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business, would land a best picture. freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else, crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals. the point about freed musicals, is that the lyrics of the songs, unlike those of hammerstein or lerner, don't have to tell or even relate to the stories. what's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film.an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals (the other two being singin' in the rain and the band wagon) which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story. the words don't fit the plot, but the routines fit the show. so, when gene kelly sings i got rhythm, he hasn't even got a girl yet, but the way it's done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation, and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point. an american in paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story, such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron's character.and what better director for this project than minnelli, himself a painter and a pianist? at this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor. while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades, minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced. in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted, but not drab, and in particular there is an absence of red. during oscar levant and georges guetary's meeting in the café, a few more vibrant shades are introduced. then, during the first musical number, "by strauss" minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red  a table cloth, a bunch of roses  until it eventually dominates, as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme. for most of the songs, the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people. however, in some numbers, such as "tra-la-la" he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated.the achilles' heel of an american in paris is its story. i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable, playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s; the headstrong, independent woman gets rejected while the meek, delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero. even if you don't mind that, it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances. compare this to singin' in the rain, which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as an american in paris, but it has a winning storyline. singin' in the rain was overlooked at the 1952 oscars, yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today. but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment, not just a means of telling a story. an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but, like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year, it certainly is a great show.

this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (gershwin) and a nice 'parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm, but in terms of a story.. well it's not really there. or at least, not very well worked out. the acting is also not so smooth by caron. but i liked some of the dialogues, i liked the scene at the seine, i liked the character played by levant, the colors; and the dancing of course, which is quite magnificent.a 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me.

the dazzling seventeen-minute dance sequence of george gershwin's 1928 orchestral piece, "an american in paris", is an indisputable masterwork. choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly, the vibrant combination of color, music and dance is still eye-poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists - dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece, manet in the flower market, utrillo in a paris street, rousseau at the fair, vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de l'opera piece, and toulouse-lautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit. the 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting, not by a long shot, but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 oscar-winning musical.director vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan, a former g.i. who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter. with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style, gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality, but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry. the love-triangle plot is focused on jerry's involvement with milo roberts, a self-proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists. on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub, jerry unapologetically falls for lise, a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of henri, a professional entertainer and friend of jerry's pal, adam, an out-of-work concert pianist. romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed.the best of these is the most imitated - a swooningly romantic song and dance to "our love is here to stay" along a faux-seine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights. the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch. few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love. "i got rhythm" and "s'wonderful" spotlight kelly's nimble tap-dancing and agreeable singing, while "embraceable you" is danced impressively by caron in a five-scene montage of henri's all-over-the-map description of lise to adam. designed to show off caron's dancing versatility, the sequence is similar to the one in "on the town" where vera-ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly's sailor character described his multi-faceted vision of miss turnstiles.as lise, the nineteen year-old caron (in her first film) dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years. looking quite glamorous, nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate, while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam. performing an elegant "i'll build a stairway to paradise", george guétary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end. this is not the best all-around mgm musical, but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile. the 2000 dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras.

this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early '50's and it's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there.the movie got directed by the genre expert vincente minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead. both did quite a few movies together back in those days, of which this one is probably their best known one. the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year, which meant it beat out movies such as "a place in the sun", "a streetcar named desire", "the african queen", "quo vadis", "the blue veil", "death of a salesman" that year. a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful, bright and entertaining movie.when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all, which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie. the musical numbers are also all nicely done, which is no big surprise when you have people such as vincente minnelli and gene kelly at work. but really, couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so? i mean, we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible. not that it makes the movie drag in any parts, it just makes it a bit overlong. the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it.one of the better mgm musicals, that is not without its flaws though.8/10

an american in paris is an integrated musical, meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story. the film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by george gershwin. the story of the film is interspersed with show-stopping dance numbers choreographed by gene kelly and set to popular gershwin tunes. songs and music include "i got rhythm," "'s wonderful," and "our love is here to stay". it set a new standard for the subgenre known as the "songbook" musical with dozens of gershwin tunes buried in the underscore. the climax is "the american in paris" ballet, an 18 minute dance featuring kelly and caron set to gershwin's an american in paris, featuring an impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters, is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any hollywood film. the ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars, a staggering sum at the time.it's funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer arthur freed (singin' in the rain, wizard of oz, on the town, meet me in st. louis and the band wagon) and ira gershwin. it was freed's idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about paris and gershwin's idea that it would only use gershwin music.original cast was to have cyd charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began. a major reason gene kelly suggested leslie caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a "real" french girl playing lise, not just an american actress playing one. gene kelly discovered leslie caron while vacationing in paris where he saw her perform in a ballet. when she got the call to audition, she said, "who's gene kelly?" according to leslie caron, her introductory dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered too suggestive by some censors. gene kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as lise is introduced.vincente minnelli first wanted maurice chevalier in the georges guétary part, and 'celeste holm' in the 'nina foch' part.minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with meet me in st. louis (1944), an american in paris, and the band wagon (1953). he used color and songs in ways they hadn't been used before. he used space and time imaginatively. best of all, though, he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies. the ballet in an american in paris may be his best work.even though vincente minnelli is credited as the sole director, he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from judy garland and other directing projects, leaving gene kelly to take over the directing duties.other highlights include guetary's rendition of "stairway to paradise"; oscar levant's fantasy of conducting and performing gershwin's "concerto in f" (see why it was oscar levant's favorite.)the ballet sequence, now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it, freed, minnelli, kelly but before the film was completed the new york office of mgm said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet. so freed went to studio head louis b. mayer himself and got him to agree, new york said no. finally gene kelly showed the new york office how a british film, the red shoes used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit  and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film. well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks.there was a break in production after 1 november 1950, at which point gene kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography. by the time production for that final sequence resumed on 6 december, vincente minnelli had finished directing another film - father's little dividend (1951).irene sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets, reflecting various french impressionist painters: 'raoul dufy' (the place de la concorde), edouard manet (the flower market), maurice utrillo (a paris street), henri rousseau (the fair), 'vincent van gogh' (the place de l'opera), and henri de toulouse-lautrec (the moulin rouge). the backgrounds took six weeks to build, with 30 painters working nonstop.roger ebert said after viewing the recent restoration, "an american in paris has many qualities, not least its famous ballet production number, with kelly and leslie caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance." an american in paris is often compared to singin' in the rain as to which it the greatest musical ever made, and one critic put it best when he said, "singin' in the rain makes me happy and an american in paris makes me feel good." the ballet represents kelly's fantasies as depicted by the great french artists (renoir, rousseau, lautrec, dufy) he admires. arranging a screening for the then ailing raoul dufy, the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits. there, relieved, they found the artist, moved to tears, requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale.the film was also the first to win a golden globe award for best motion picture (comedy or musical.)gene kelly received an honorary academy award that year for "his versatility as an actor, singer, director and dancer, and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film." it was his only oscar.

an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration. he meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public, e.g. in a museum. golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing. he also meets the main girl lise bouvier (leslie caron) who is engaged to his best friend. he can't help his feelings for this girl, even after he finds out who she is engaged to. filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance, this is a very good musical film. it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence, i.e. the american in paris ballet, but there is a good happy ending. it won the oscars for best art direction-set decoration, best cinematography, best costume design, best music, scoring of a musical picture, best writing, story and screenplay and best picture, and it was nominated for best director for vincente minnelli and best film editing, it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source, and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - musical/comedy, and it was nominated for best director for vincente millenni (liza's father). gene kelly was number 66 on the 100 movie stars, and he was number 15 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, "i got rhythm" was number 32 on 100 years, 100 songs, the film was number 9 on 100 years of musicals, it was number 39 on 100 years, 100 passions, it was number 68 on 100 years, 100 movies, and it was number 58 on the 100 greatest musicals. very good!

if i remember, ira gershwin, the lyricist and brother of george, offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers. in many respects, it was a typical 50's movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kelly.the gershwins were, of course, among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, george himself was among the greatest of all american composers, period!!! gene kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical (one guess as to the other?) and i don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt. but, i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and, as an actual friend of george gershwin, he had to be in this film. he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself.leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french "gamin" type. a talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. george guétary who plays the part of maurice chavalier, oops, i mean henri baurel, was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the part.gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but guétary has much the better vocal equipment. though gene was better cast elsewhere as, obviously, in "singin' in the rain" where his character is much more calculating, even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times (he was, not for nothing, cast as the original heel joey in pal joey, the broadway musical.) i was not so enchanted with his "i got rhythm" scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion.i also found nina foch's character milo to be rather irritating.but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist painters.i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar, as struggling artists, and i don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but, on balance, the gershwin music is very well served in this film.the dvd is well-done with fine clear graphics (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow.

... oxford, mississippi, at least. okay, the paris we get is paris, culver city apart from the establishing library footage of the real mccoy but it is paris in spirit than which nothing, nowhere, is better. okay, kelly is no astaire but then who is and caron is no hepburn, ditto but alan lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated comden and green who scripted kelly's other 'big' 50s musical singin' in the rain (a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by other lyricists and just to balance things the gershwin numbers are far superior to the arthur freed/nacio herb brown numbers so alan lerner didn't have to feel too outclassed). the story needn't detain us any more than the anomalies -kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter, i.e. bohemian, yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when foch invites him to dinner at her hotel; in the well-documented love is here to stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic - this is, after all, a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square. as feel good musicals go it's definitely in the top 10.

there are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close to flawless. this is soooo funny!! and it has quite a bit of satire there to. sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv-diva. sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot! in the same league is kevin kline, robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg (who unfortunately has too little to do here). downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful one. but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste, a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret (you will see in the absolutely stunning finale!). sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. i normally like ms shue, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate. otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever.

the story and music (george gershwin!) are wonderful, as are levant, guetary, foch, and, of course, kelly. one thing's missing, and that thing is a good leading lady. i'm sorry, leslie caron bothers me. anyway, despite her, the plot moves along nicely with the famous (and deservedly so) ballet. oh the colours, the dazzling reds, blues, greens, and yellows. musn't forget the beiges as well. ; ) i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever-so-brilliant ballet.so i suppose what i'm trying to say is this: please, by all means see it, and enjoy it, because though it isn't the best, it is marvelous. but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward.

an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly. watch as gene sings, acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations. some purely majestic, others pure corn. one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before "singin' in the rain". he is definately one of the all time greats. it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in kelly's characters, the only main difference being that one is based in paris, the other in l.a.some have said that leslie caron's acting was less than pure. perhaps cyd charisse, who was originally intended for the role could have done better, however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly. oscar levant's short role in this film gave it just what it needed, someone who doesn't look like gene kelly. filling the role as the everyman isn't an easy task, yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead.the song and dance routines are all perfection. even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without. seeing that there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable, minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you'd spent four hours with them. ingenious!i would have to rate this film up with singin' since it is very similar in story and song. singin' would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance.full recommendation.8/10 stars.

paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music, and to fall madly in love - as is the case in this film. boy meets girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way of eternal happiness, the classic story.the wonderful music of george gerschwin complements the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron. "an american in paris" is a humorous, light-hearted, loving film well worth watching.8/10

uggh! i really wasn't that impressed by this film, though i must admit that it is technically well made. it does get a 7 for very high production values, but as for entertainment values, it is rather poor. in fact, i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s. it won the oscar for best picture, but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing. that's because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting (such as meet me in st. louis), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. in fact, this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren't into this, the film will quickly bore you. give me more story! as a result, with overblown production numbers and a weak story, this film is like a steady diet of meringue--it just doesn't satisfy in the long run. to think...this is the film that beat out "a streetcar named desire" and "a place in the sun" for best picture! and, to make matters worse, "the african queen" and "ace in the hole" weren't even nominated in this category! even more amazing to me is that "ace in the hole" lost for best writing, screenplay to this film--even though "an american in paris" had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song.

while the story is sweet, and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music (gershwin), the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art, kelly's enthralling choreography (including his rapturous "pas de deux d'amour", really a separate genre), with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set. matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist.

i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites. it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli. it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay. the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big. nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him, but soon finds she loves the guy. meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel, leslie caron. his main dancing partner, and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. famous french singer georges guietary sings, too. so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant's nimble piano fingers, the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 8/10

released two years before i was born, this oscar-winning movie has it all - lavish technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb wall-to-wall gershwin music, superior choreography, a lighter-than-air screenplay, and great performances by kelly, levant, foch, guetary, and caron. hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore. definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which i judge all other films. enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!

timeless musical gem, with gene kelly in top form, stylish direction by vincente minnelli, and wonderful musical numbers. it is great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people watch with a smile and say "they don't make 'em like they used to!" but they never did quite make them like this. the climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved. a must see!

i enjoyed this film. it was lighthearted, delightful, and very colorful. you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor. there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. every scene is packed full. the choreography was great. gene kelly is a wonder. he is so talented. the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. the last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. what makes this film very special is gershwin's music. few american composers have had a better gift for melody. i very much enjoy gershwin's music. it is enchanting. ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. he is so witty and charming. this was a highly entertaining film.

okay, so the plot is on shaky ground. yeah, all right, so there are some randomly inserted song and/or dance sequences (for example: adam's concert and henri's stage act). and leslie caron can't really, um, you know... act.but somehow, 'an american in paris' manages to come through it all as a polished, first-rate musical--largely on the basis of gene kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography, and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron. (he needs to, because she seems to have a... problem with emoting.) the most accomplished and technically awe-inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film. it's stunningly filmed, and kelly and caron dance beautifully. but my favourite number would have to be kelly's character singing 'i got rhythm' with a bunch of french school-children, then breaking into an array of american dances. it just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real *talent*.not on the 'classics' level with 'singin' in the rain', but pretty high up there nonetheless. worth the watch!

i have been a fan of this movie for years and years. because of teri hatchers move into the forefront, i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it. why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me? sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous. although i never have watching daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time i watch it. the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart. i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already. you will get to see elizabeth shue, whoopi goldberg, teri hatcher, and carrie fisher...to name a few...all give splendid performances.

i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film's page because some of it was slightly misinformative.originally i posted quotes from the original poster, but i wasn't sure if it was proper given that this is the "comments" index and not a message board (though we used to use 'em that way back before imdb added the film message boards) so i will edit this to make it unnecessary.well, first of all you may not be aware of this, but gene kelly first became famous for playing "pal joey" on broadway in the original production. when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin "panorama" film, he wanted kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "goody two shoes" roles he had been playing in most his films (with the exception of "for me and my gal"). alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of "pal joey". this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to "pal joey." in my opinion, the wb film "pal joey" is a wreck, though sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sunk the film (script changes and poor direction. ===================================================you complain that kelly's pictures are not well done, even citing your art education to prove the point. but you miss the fact that kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story/characters. the pictures are so bad, the audience knows that kelly isn't ready for an exhibition. even he knows it, though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her. but it's important that the audience not be sitting there saying "but, he's a great artist, if he only had the chance!". you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show; again you are not understanding the structure of the story. he refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he's not really ready for the exhibition. his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as "joey's" enthusiasm to "start a nightclub". but it serves the same function in the plot. remember, it's essential in "pal joey" (the play) that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn't deserve it. same with the art show. if kelly's paintings were actually good, it would undermine this whole point. ===================================================then you complain that caron and kelly have no "chemistry". i guess it's in the eye of the beholder. i agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine. compare it to even worse "forced" romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in "the pride and the passion". ====================================================when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film, it just shows that you haven't dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism. many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters, and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism. it's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone). the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships. if you didn't' see that, it's not the movie's fault. it's certainly not a "load of crap". ==================================================

an american in paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and hollywood musical. made at the height of mgm's powers as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable music from the gershwins, who rightly have been called the 20th century's equivalent of beethoven and mozart. gene kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in singin' in the rain (1952). the two films are actually closely linked. aside from the arthur freed connection, the broadway melody segment in "rain" owes its existence to the incredible american in paris ballet sequence in this film. this might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film. and it deserved to be, as it showcases gene kelly's skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.the film's cast is uniformly excellent. leslie caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she'd been making films for years. her introductory dance sequence, and later her work on the ballet, provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in mgm musicals only by cyd charisse's work in singin' in the rain and the band wagon. oscar levant is hilarious as kelly's stoic pal, who gets two of the film's best moments: during the end party sequence (which i will not give away for anyone who hasn't seen the film), and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects.less memorable are georges guetary as kelly's romantic rival, though he does get a few musical highlights, and nina foch as leslie caron's romantic rival. the may-december relationship between kelly's character and nina's reminded me of the same "kept man" relationship seen between george peppard and patricia neal in breakfast at tiffany's.there are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than singin' in the rain. the ballet, though lavish and well-produced, doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. without giving away the plot, the ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason. and unlike the broadway melody sequence, it really doesn't have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d'etre. making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the ballet. although the ending shouldn't be a surprise (this is an mgm musical, after all), i was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the ballet ended. it's as if director vincente minnelli felt that he couldn't follow the ballet with anything else. the film literally left me in the lurch.that negative aside, an american in paris rightly ranks alongside the best of hollywood's musicals. it doesn't quite reach the heights of singin' in the rain, but it comes close and it remains a testament to gene kelly's skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.

i saw "an american in paris" on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway. i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since, both in the cinema and on tv. it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (george gershwin) and features the greatest male (gene kelly) and female (leslie caron) dancers in hollywood history. the supporting cast of oscar levant (as quirky as ever), georges guetary (why didn't he make more movies ?) and nina foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. the closing ballet, superbly choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "it's very clear" (caron and kelly on the banks of the seine) and "i got rhythm" (the kids of paris joining gene kelly in "une chanson americaine"). if you love paris, see this movie. if you've never been to paris in your life, see it. but see it !

gene kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with mgm. here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the arthur freed musical unit. hard to believe when you watch an american in paris that the players never left the back lot at mgm. the magic of an american in paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of vincent minnelli and the sets that mgm designed blended with some background establishing shots. the idea of the film originated with kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving george gershwin's tone poem an american in paris. it sounded good to arthur freed who approached ira gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other gershwin material.gershwin got the kind of deal for gershwin music that irving berlin normally got. not one note of non-gershwin music is heard in an american in paris. listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like embraceable you and but not for me which are not real musical numbers.another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics, alan jay lerner, wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one. all about an ex-gi played by gene kelly who after world war ii never left france, just settled into an apartment on the left bank and proceeded to become a starving artist. he lives with eccentric composer oscar levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy. two women are interested in him. another expatriate american played by nina foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters. but kelly falls for a shop girl played by leslie caron in her film debut. caron also has musical comedy star georges guetary interested in here.of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of george gershwin. an american in paris happens to be the first film i ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip i ever took. i still remember flying back from phoenix arizona to kennedy airport seeing gene kelly doing i've got rhythm. my favorite number in the film however is tra-la-la which kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with oscar levant playing the piano. at one point kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.in a book about arthur freed, i read a quote where he said in the american in paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the french impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot. so it happened that way. kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in words and music, the pirate, and on the town. but this one topped them all. still does in my opinion and that includes some of gene kelly's later films.in a surprise upset at the oscars, an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951, beating out the heavily favored a streetcar named desire. i guess fantasy trumped realism that year. big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.still an american in paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof, something less likely to be repeated.

vincente minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history... he was among the first hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color, motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment... 'american in paris' is the story of an ex-gi who remains in france after the war to study and paint... he falls in love with a charming gamine lise bourvier... their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the city of lights itself... the whole movie brings a touch of french elegance where technique, artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism...the first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of leslie caron in her screen debut... she is like a diamond, a touch of class... george guetary describes his fiancée ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles, sweet and shy, vivacious and modern, graceful and awesome... the number leads to an unpretentious bistro, where kelly and his very good friends in paris share a gentle parody of viennese waltzes... later kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him 'i got rhythm,' and at the massive jazz nightclub kelly spots the girl of his dreams... he is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes, and only one clear thing is in his mind, to pull lize onto the dance floor and sing to her: "it's very clear, our love is here to stay."to the joyful 'tra-la-la,' kelly provides humor, wit and talent all around oscar levant's room ,and even on the top of his brown piano... when he meets his pretty cinderella along the seine river, kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with caron... he expresses all his emotions with 'our love is here to stay.' the piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft, blue smoky light... they start an enchanting dance-duet juxtaposing differing elements... caron dances with her head on his shoulder, then tries to run away in a fluid way... they move backward, away from each other, then pause to rush toward each other, for a little kiss, and a warm hug...the film's weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story... in one, georges guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage... in another, oscar levant imagines himself conducting a concert, and playing not only a piano recital, but the other instruments as well... he even applauds to himself as members of the audience...the extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure, a breakthrough in taste, direction and design... it is a blaze of love, fury and vividness... it is kelly's major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of france's most impressionist painters...the number starts at the beaux arts ball after kelly finds himself separated from lise, and begins a sketch with a black crayon... it gathers the important parts of the film's story through a constantly changing locations, all in the style of the painters who have influenced jerry... the tour, richly attractive and superbly atmospheric, includes the place de la concorde fountain, the madeleine flower market, the place de l'opéra, to his rendez-vous at montmartre, with the cancan dancers in a representation of lautrec's moulin rouge...kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self... caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place...nina foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one-shouldered white gown... in one of the film's most famous lines, kelly asks her: 'that's quite a dress you almost have on. what holds it up?" nina, cleverly replies, "modesty!"'an american in paris' garnered six oscars, including an honorary award to gene kelly... the film gave us a wealth of memories to take home...

anyone who doesn't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed. i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes. sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert, a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise. fields, at 45, still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children. i'm biased, i'm in love with her.the cast of "soapdish" is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection. kevin kline is flawless, as are robert downey jr., an ingénue elizabeth shue, whoopi goldberg, teri hatcher in one of her early roles, carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious.this movie should have won oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years. you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.

till hbo began rerunning it this month. i remember laughing out loud in the theater back in 1991, and now again in my living room. if i see that it's on, i have to watch it. there's just no question. this is so much more entertaining to me than other, more popular spoofs like airplane! (which i really like, btw). cathy moriarty steals the show in my opinion. quotes like "sudden speech! the last symptoms of brain fever! she could blow at any moment!" put me over the edge. and whoopie goldberg hasn't been this funny since 'jumpin' jack flash'. kevin klein, sally field, robert downey jr. all turn in superb performances as expected. i started out giving this 9 out of 10 stars, but then i realized that for the type of film it's supposed to be, there isn't one thing i'd change or improve upon. so 10 it is. i have to get this on dvd, that's just all there is to it.

i don't watch soaps. my grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass. i made fun of them it when i was ten (it was so easy).but this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. i found the story pretty damn funny. the fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just top it off. the huge hair, the high heels, and the histrionics - what a combination.and all the actors just go to town, chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile. sally, kevin, elisabeth - wonderful! whoopi - great! robert downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, before the tabloids. and garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film? leesa gibbons - hadn't been missing her, but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for that job, anyway?).admittedly, i could have done without sally climbing the drainpipe. lucy ricardo did it, how many times?, as has every comedienne from carol burnett to i don't know who and i'm so done with it now, i could spit peanuts if i had them. apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in new york. i'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit.but it was cute, it was funny, it had plot twists, it had an after credits ending before that was common, it had clothes worthy of a second glance, it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me. really, what more do you need?

way back in 1955, the british made a comedy called simon and laura, with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall. to this day, it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and, more particularly, about how television sitcoms become so popular. it was, and is, an excellent example also of self-referential cinema.so also soapdish, a film i'd never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv. i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well, as you know.however, i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv. in fact, it's been a while since i laughed so heartily. so, if you like satire, i'd recommend you see it.the main actors  sally field, kevin kline, robert downey and cathy moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job, revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is. as i watched it, i kept thinking to myself: just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life? that is, if actors ever do have a real life? as you probably know, peter sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person. so, as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie, i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch...is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter (lori, played by elizabeth shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she'd used, on a prior episode of her daytime soap, when confronting her fictional daughter in that show! are you confused? well, it's not all like that, but the dialog is stunning for originality, comedy, bitchiness, anger, depravity, duplicity, and even...love.the story? well, there are many stories in this film, all interwoven, and which all come together at the end (of course  but not like a robert altman film, okay!), and not all of them are resolved finally. life's not like that anyway, right? the pace is almost frenetic, and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes. spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you won't regret the time usage.the rest of the cast all perform well, although i've never taken much to whoopi goldberg. perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as the outstanding player. i kid you not, she gives the term bitch an entirely new face...

this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change. as usual the lovers--sally field as almost-over-the-hill soap opera queen, celeste talbert; and kevin kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, jeffrey anderson--are working at cross purposes, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc. owing a little to bette davis's margo channing in all about eve (1950) and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition, sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness. kevin kline, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time.the misadventures center around celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, aspiring actress cori craven (elisabeth shue) who turns out not to be her niece, with ensuing plot complications. cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to celeste (and to jeffrey anderson as well)--but never mind.as a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are robert downey jr. (soap opera director, david barnes) and cathy moriarty (montana and nurse nan). david barnes is oh so hot for her, but she cares only about one thing: getting rid of celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set. to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck celeste's career, but through happenstance and/or a perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the viewer.whoopie goldberg plays rose schwartz, the show's chief writer and celeste's alter-ego and confidant while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard-as-nails producer of the show.i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen (young doctors in love 1982 which burlesqued tv's general hospital and was pretty good). soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh-out-loud one-liners and terrific performances by field, kline and downy, jr. but see this for sally field who is outstanding.

this movie is about a fictional soap opera. it is very fast and funny. to say anything else would ruin the movie. there are several plots and sub plots in the movie. this movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars. they all gives over the top performances. this movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!if you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious!!!

soapdish may go down as one of the single most under-rated movies ever made.a stellar, unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it. while everyone hammed it up, there was no one-upmanship. kline showed wit and great physical comedy, goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, i could just go on.do not pass this movie by!

this is one of those movies - like dave, american dreamer and local hero - that holds a viewer's interest time and again. lightweight movies seldom win oscars, but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one. even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. true, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg: "now why can't i write sh*t like that?" i think it's unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.

fast paced and funny satire about that original "reality tv", the soap opera. the script by playwright robert harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations. the best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant. keven kline's murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. "her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses." the brilliant cast is on the same page as kline. sally field, elizabeth shue, cathy moriarty, robert downey jr., whoopi goldberg, teri hatcher, garry marshall, and kathy najimy are all perfect. it is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie. this is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks.p.s. the score by alan silvestri is an added bonus. it fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air.

warning: possible spoilers (but not really - keep reading). ahhh, there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won't have room to list them all. the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting peres 'prez' prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable, and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names, including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tv's superman.every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors, actresses and producers in daytime tv. peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned, delicious farce. robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine, but feels like a gift to us in the audience. some of the cliched characters are a bit dim, but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy, especially against celeste talbert (sally field) who is the show's perennial award-winning lead, nicknamed "america's sweetheart". the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celeste's show, the sun also sets. against all vain fears to the contrary, celeste wins again. she is overjoyed, because it's always "such a genuine thrill": "adam, did you watch? i won! well, nguh..." the reason for adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot, and we're instantly off on a trip with celeste's neuroses. she cries, screeches, and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee (kathy najimi, constantly waddling after celeste, unseen through celeste's fog of paranoia) indulges a taste for tammy faye baker, for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired.rosie schwartz (whoopi goldberg) has seen it all before. she is the head writer of the show, and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years. so when celeste freaks, rosie offers to write her off the show for six months: "we'll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama." but celeste has doubts: "i thought that the dalai lama moved to la." "-well, then, some other lama, fernando lamas, come on!". such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas, son of aforementioned fernando lamas (d. 1982).those who can remember the economics teacher (ben stein) in ferris bueller's day off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll ("bueller. bueller. bueller"), will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer. other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall (in real life mr happy days and brother of penny), who "gets paid $1.2 million to make the command decisions" on the sun also sets - he says he definitely likes "peppy and cheap"; and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon, who's "a bitch".geoffrey anderson (kevin kline) is the "yummy-with-a-spoon" (and he is, by the way) dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes (robert downey jr), and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier. of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, rod randall, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago. somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo-choo.celeste can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps. first, her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara, but she soon degenerates into a stalker. unfortunately, she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily. geoffrey's been promised development of his one-man play about hamlet, and he means to hold the producer to that promise. "i'm not going back to florida no-how!", argues geoffrey. "you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !" and indeed, seeing geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious. back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room, geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as "mr loman". he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe, and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer. now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven, the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.beautiful elizabeth shue (as laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well. but, of course, the course to true love never did run smoothly. montana moorehead (cathy moriarty) is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise, and is getting desperate for some publicity.will her plots finally succeed? will celeste settle her nerves, or will she kill tawnee first? will the producer get mr fuzzy? -you'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable, farcically malicious riot.and you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter. if you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face, feel free to demand your money back for the video rental. soapdish (1991) is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again, because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. this is very well-crafted humor, almost all of it in the writing. a draw with blazing saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar. watch it and weep. a happy source for anyone's video addiction. 10 out of 10.

'soapdish' is one of the best, yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's. the film revolves around the various off-camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera. the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic a-list cast. 'soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era.the film is superbly led by sally field, as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert (she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like "gloria f*cking swanson!"). her supporting cast reads like a who's-who of 90's movie greats! whoopi goldberg, robert downey jr, teri hatcher, kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly. goldberg is predictably excellent, whilst downey jr.'s and hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve.in terms of writing, the film is outstanding. there is a really modern edge to the script, which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time. in some ways, the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'high anxiety' (1977). much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors. for example, the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher, is both hilarious and honest.'soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's. it's excellent script and a-class cast make it a must-see. it's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes.

the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive sally's flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie, but wait! there's more! this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv, movie stars on the way down, (and up) and the horrors of love. robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius, and cathy moriarty is splendid. the dialogue is witty, and the physical humor done with consummate skill. this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting, directing, and writing.

this has to be, hands down, hats off, one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the daytime awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. now that is only in the first few minutes. then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. this was the first time i'd seen the always charming teri hatcher. while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for lois & clark. not a huge follower, but if i run across an episode i'd watch it. robert downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic david seaton barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see sally field's celeste talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty's montana moorehead.moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. here, all she has to do is scream "i hate you i hate you you creep!" or give one of her anti-celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles. yes, cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne. sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70-mm-sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher, if only for a glorified cameo. she doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. she takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! at the time, she wasn't really known for much. adventures in babysitting was kind of cute (yes, i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price), but she didn't hold my attention - - much. but here, she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother.i'll stop there - i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. if you've seen it, then reminisce. if you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really. the dvd's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.

i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen. robert harling's script is near perfect, just check out the "quotes" section; on second thought, just rent the dvd, since it's the delivery that really makes the lines sing.sally field gives a comic, over-the-top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else, and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious. robert downey, jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer. i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue, but she's great here as the one *real* person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of "the sun also sets" -- that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave. either that, or he's laughing really hard.five stars. funny, funny, funny.

it's very funny. it has a great cast who each give great performances. especially sally field and kevin kline. it's a well written screenplay by andrew bergman (honeymoon in vegas). i don't like soap operas, even though i never watch them. but i do love this film because it's so crazy and off the wall, that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television. in my opinion, it's the best film of 1991.

years ago i did follow a soap on tv. so i was curious about this movie, and i was so rewarded for finding it. it's a marvelous spoof of soaps, with jealousies, the usual actors' insecurities, and all sorts of lovely excesses. but more than anything - an amazing cast and an incredible script. how did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie? and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines? i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it, but it's marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it. sometimes i'll throw it on while doing housecleaning, and end up sitting on the couch, watching, laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing. many congrats to all who made it.

this is one of the best comedy ever ! the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast, well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great. if you're a kevin kline fan, he does (as always) an fantastic performance, and robert downey jr is perfect. if you don't laugh while seen this movie, you don't have any sense of humor.

a riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas! this film is hilarious! admittedly, you have to have a taste for films with screaming, hysterical dialogue, over-the-top acting, and melodramatic plot twists. but if you do, you're in for one hell of a treat.sally field plays celeste talbert, daytime tv's "queen of misery." celeste's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of lori craven (elisabeth shue), her long-lost niece, and, simultaneously, jeffrey anderson (kevin kline - splendid as always), celeste's long-ago lover. but celeste has been hiding a deep, dark secret, and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface. add in the diabolical montana moorehead (a wonderful cathy moriarty, in full "gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode"), who is trying mighty hard to destroy celeste's career; david (robert downey, jr.), the weenie-boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with montana to ruin celeste; and, rose schwarz (whoopi goldberg), scriptwriter and celeste's one true confidant, and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos.chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute (does anyone remember 'mixed nuts'?), but when done well, can be pretty damn funny! a major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look. field, kline, goldberg, and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm. shue is clearly the weakest link here, but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by field, kline, et al. moriarty is a stand-out in the showy villainess role, making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see!! there are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small (but, nevertheless, all very funny) roles, including carrie fisher, garry marshall, kathy najimy, and teri hatcher. director michael hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish. mention must also be made of robert harling's screenplay, carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera. the dialogue is boiling over with great lines, delivered brilliantly by the actors (i'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised).look, if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it, get your hands on this one. if not for anything else, it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh!

it really is a shame that films like this never snag best picture nominations, because this one is simply a winner. this is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy i have ever seen. its screenplay and design are impeccable, not to mention the incredible cast. i can quote this movie for hours on end. watch it.

it's funny. it's not arthur miller or t.s. elliot, but man this is funny. kline and fields are great. (her toss-off line "god, you are so disgusting" as she climbs in his window - great! kline's running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher - great too!) robert downey jr. and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is... a soap opera turn if there every was one!the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rental price.doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t.v. (i hope). just a lot of fun.

for a mature man, to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response, to a mature film.if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that, "life" can never be the same, after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level.

picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii's past and the people who lived there in that time. the time, money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live, takes a whole new meaning to blood, sweat and tears.the concept of dating/matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net. just that is more of snail mail. very slow snail mail.the singing of the plantation's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers' songs of their demise and future goals.the movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring. like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.

this is a great film. from reading other reviews, i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear. tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction, she made the ending heartfelt and memorable. in the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and corny. one would never guess this film was done on a tight, limited budget. the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors. the script is so wonderful, i can see why they all wanted to be in it. if you watch the long, long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen, and for good reason. the soundtrack (available on cd) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. my only "complaint" is that i almost didn't want the film to end.

i saw this when it premiered and just re-watched it on ifc again. this is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900's. my grandparents were part of that migration; my parents were born on a kohala plantation (big island) at the time setting of the movie. i moved to the big island over a year ago after living in california for over 30 years. i was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped, with wild cane still growing, years after the plantations closed. i've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation. this movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories. this story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie. it leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman's. some people just don't get it.i didn't recall that youki kudoh had the starring role, with which she did an incredible job. i recall her great performances in jim jarmusch's "mystery train" and in an australian film, co- starring with russell crowe, "heaven's burning". tamlyn tomita did a great job with her pidgin english, especially for someone who didn't grow up in the islands. i had forgotten that toshiro mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. and i missed the fact that jason scott lee had an uncredited, non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene. i was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer, kayo hatta, died in an accidental drowning in 2005. there are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience: "gaijin" about the immigrant cane workers in brazil (many of them japanese) in the same time period; and "sugar cane alley" about the cane plantation experience in africa. the latter is still available, but "gaijin", sadly, doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. another great film about the early asian in america experience when immigrants were more like slaves is "a thousand pieces of gold". this was set over the chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad, starred rosalind chao, chris cooper, michael paul chan, and dennis dun.

good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history.very good acting and script.not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed,be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust.very touching as well for the spiritually mature. not for people who do not like to think......

japan 1918. the story of 16-year old ryu begins with the death of her father. as it will be revealed later, both of her parents have died of tuberculosis. in this desperate situation ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a japanese man in hawai, whom they know only from its picture. by her arrival in hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph ,and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on. ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away. she soon discovers that she has nowhere to go. the friendship to kana, a female co-worker of hers, gives her new hope and strength. this picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of asian woman were married off to men in america, whom they only knew from their picture. this not very well known picture is well written and acted. the location is breathtaking. this film also features mifune toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a benshi (narrator of silent movies). this film gives some insight of japanese culture here and across the ocean. a must see!

picture bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for japanese men brought to hawaii at the turn of the 19th century to work in the sugar cane fields. most came planning to return to their homeland, but few were ever able to do so. equally movingly portrayed is the fate of japanese women, some as young as fifteen or sixteen, who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15-years out of date, or were of some other younger man. they too worked long hard hours in the fields, while fighting homesickness and to preserve their dignity.director hatta's portrayal of one picture bride's courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical duress, is, ultimately, inspirational and uplifting--a story of moral and cultural survival. there is a grandness and magnificence of sweep of character and landscape in picture bride that captures the alluring beauty as well as violent harshness of colonial hawaii. this is a film that is emotionally, intellectually and artistically rewarding.

clara bow (hula calhoun) is daughter of plantation owner albert gran (bill calhoun), who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends. she's interested in riding in the countryside until engineer clive brook (anthony haldane) shows up to build a dam. one of her father's friends arlette marchal (mrs. bane) then competes for his attentions. his wife maude truax (margaret haldane) shows up for the contrived finale.lots of 'pre-code' elements like nude bathing.wonderful location shooting in hawaii.

clara bow's beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film. "hula" is not quite up to par with clara's best films but it is still enjoyable. she dances, she rides her horse, and pursues the man that she loves. this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming (gone with the wind).the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time. if you like clara, i would reccomend "hula."

ok clara bow silent film from 1927, it's a spin-off of rain, with bow playing the half-hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid english engineer--clive brook. bow competes with the local widow (arlette marchal) for his attentions, but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up (patricia dupont). the predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune. bow settles her hash fast.bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes: her opening nude bath, her hula in a grass skirt, and the dog rescue scene with bow and brook doing their own stunts.note: the imdb credit list is wrong. the film credits (from the dvd i have) list patricia dupont as playing mrs. haldane---not margaret truax as listed on imdb.

many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow. although the story-line was rather typical of clara's later silents, i still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. clara plays a happy-go-lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a nice showcase of clara's ability to make the audience laugh.

this is such a great film! never mind the low rating here. i really have no idea where that came from, they must be discussing a different film then. because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure. it's story was so original and charming.. i really can't think of anything bad to say about it. maybe it has to be ''your type of thing'', but, i saw this with my sister and my mother, and we all were taken by it. the acting was also very good, and that is hard to do in a film like this. but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. i've always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new ''dark'' role very interesting. it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy, but i absolutely had no problem with that this time. even more so, i adored him. everyone who loves a good thriller/drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film, no question about that! anyone wanting to see a film with 80% bloodshed, should go rent something else, though.. but i guess the title already kind of gives that away. this is a love story, not saw 3.i give this film 4 out of five stars!!! good job!!!xxx enjoy!

this movie was for a while in my collection, but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until i decided that i should watch it. i did not know much about close to leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  aids. although the person who has aids  is leo  the scenario wraps around the way in which marcel (the youngest brother of leo) coupes with the sickness of his relative. at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young marcel. i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves . with exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from marcel, they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness. the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families i know will be reluctant to do that. there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends , concern about each other.close to leo is an excellent drama, which i strongly recommend

i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it. i was very moved by this movie. i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault. as in real life though sometimes people disappoint, as was the case with leo, who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status. i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him, and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train. i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men. this is in no way meant to bash gays (i am gay) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others. the only part of the movie i couldn't understand was why the (gay friendly) family was unwilling to include marcel in leo's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral.i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex!

i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. when leo, the oldest announces that he is hiv+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange.i have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at each other. i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving film.

this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. when leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.the director, christophe honore, has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen. nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.the news has a devastating effect on marcel, the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers.

i loved this movie. first, because it is a family movie. second, because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family, with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies. the brothers are very close, yet are not judgmental. their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble, but not needed in the end. i understand that leo's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people, but i believed it was the right choice for him. i can't believe that this was a french television programme. it had great production values. i gave this movie a ten, and i think you will too, once you have seen it.

it is projected that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of aids. the projected toll is greatest in sub-saharan africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected. beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about. christophe honoré describes one of the most moving in close to leo, a film produced for french television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people. though fictional, it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common -- the effect of a diagnosis of hiv on a loving close-knit family.when twenty one-year old leo (pierre mignard) tells his parents and two teenage brothers, tristan (rodolphe pauley) and pierrot (jeremie lippmann) that he has aids, the family is devastated. out of concern for his youth, they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother, 12-year old marcel (yannis lespert) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically. when leo goes to paris for treatment, he takes marcel with him but the young boy confronts leo and demands to know the truth. leo tells him that he is ill and marcel is sad but accepting. when he brings marcel along to meet some former gay friends, however, tension between them boils to the surface, setting the stage for a riveting conclusion. although i was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers, i feel that the sincerity of close to leo and the brilliant performances by lespert and mignard more than tip the scales in its favor. seeing events unfold from the young boy's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the quebecois film leolo and truffaut's the 400 blows. unlike some american films that dance around the anguish of aids, close to leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real.

it was very heart-warming. as an expatriated french, i particularly enjoyed this "tv" movie, which i think deserves a broader distribution. the acting was good, and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed sostrong and so natural. no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids. one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son (leo), who has contracted hiv, and the youngest son (marcel), to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation. the two charactersprogressively explore each other as time runs out for leo, who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs...

well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert, writer/director pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! the acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, huppert and co-star gerard depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern french stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.i have 3 more of pialat's films in my "vhs to watch" pile, albeit all in french without english subtitles; due to this fact but also loulou's oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - i can't say that i'm in any particular hurry to check them out now...

this is quite a dull movie. well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates. one of france's revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu - i believe they made 7 together - pialat fails to engage. it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like "i don't know"; "i like his arms"; "i like the way he makes love" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because... i assume he loves her. so he accepts and hope for what? that she will one day wake up and come to her senses. things like this are not answered in pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. jules et jim, this is not. the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving.

'loulou' delights in the same way an expensive, high quality french wine does. it leaves you with a very fine aftertaste.'loulou's theme isn't new. the film doesn't carry an original plot either. its colored picturing shows fine, but not extraordinary. its setting is serious. its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.whatever one further may say about 'loulou', it's beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting. the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them, making the plot alive. their acting fully invites you to participate, to make friends.for those around at the time, 'loulou' also provides an extra bonus: its perfectly captured mood of 1980.

pialat films people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. in la gueule ouverte, he's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son as she dies of cancer. in a nos amours, the teenage girl's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family. here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con. her motivation is a little cloudy, since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows; on the other hand, he's got a fabulous body (i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique--he would have been great as a rugby player).the casting is impressive. isabelle huppert isn't allowed to give a bland, inexpressive performance (she has given many); depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want--see the scene in the bar, where he's stabbed in the gut, runs away and seeks treatment, then soon restarts with nelly. guy marchand, with those coal-black eyes and distressed look, plays nelly's husband beautifully; it's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre.

liked stanley & iris very much. acting was very good. story had a unique and interesting arrangement. the absence of violence and sex was refreshing. characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. very enjoyable movie.

another comment about this film made it sound lousy. given talking pictures were so new - i think the script and acting were good. davis was so young and fresh. she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.so many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.

...that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version.despite all of the other comments written here, i really prefer the bette davis version, even though the novak version has a more coherent story line.however: davis' mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute.and it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. he has emotions of despair, of failure, of "otherness" - strong emotions that he represses. davis' mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. she has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of "otherness"; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era.novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis', almost through the the whole movie. davis' mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance. and when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: "i wiped my mouth! i wiped my mouth!!" novak's vulnerability was excellent. davis' realism was monumental.imdb votes concur!

although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress/prostitute mildred rogers, this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole. the acting is indeed fine in most every respect. what i cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why phillip, a sensitive, well-bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him: i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects. yes, i know he is a sensitive club-footed, introverted intellectual. but davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable. davis is astounding in her role: yes, she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then, but it's a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it. too bad she wasn't playing a gangster's moll. her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low-lifes!

when i saw that this film was only 80 minutes long, i thought we were in trouble. condensing the gigantic w. somerset maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen. but you know, the movie's not half bad, and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers.i've heard many film buffs complain that leslie howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but i can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of philip carey than a wet noodle, for that's certainly what carey is. howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly, then finally take him out and buy him a spine.ah, and then there's bette, as the girl with whom carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him. i didn't know what on earth the appeal of mildred was in the book, and the movie stays true to that detail. but as played by davis, she does become the most fascinating character in the story, and if she's nasty and unlikable, she's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time. davis's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting, much as brando's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out "stella!!" in that little-known tennesee williams play, and it's not hard to see why. davis is intense to the point of scary. she makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience, and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous. her appearance when carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease (though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it's an std) is shocking. of course, it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the production code went into effect; if it had been made a year later, you can bet things would have been a bit different.yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor, and the story really does become about carey and mildred and not much else. i found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now, so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did.grade: b+

today actresses happily gain weight, dye their hair, dress like slobs, and lose their glamor for a role, and bette davis was probably the actress who started the trend. even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and constance bennett-type makeup in films, davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside.her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film, "of human bondage," in which she stars with leslie howard as philip carey. davis plays mildred, a slutty, manipulative, greedy low-life to howard's masochistic, club-footed philip. he first meets her when she's a waitress, and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man (alan hale sr.). in truth, mildred is repulsed by philip's club foot. on his part, philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him. he allows mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her, while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women (kay johnson and frances dee). when he gets the gumption to throw her out, mildred trashes his apartment and robs him, forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings."of human bondage" looks rather stilted today in parts. though leslie howard was a wonderful actor and attractive, his acting style is of a more formal old school, and as a result, he tends to date whatever he's in. he shines in material like his role opposite davis in "it's love i'm after" or "the petrified forest" which call for his kind of technique. his dated acting is even more obvious here because davis was forging new ground with a gritty, edgy performance that would really make her name. if she seems at times over the top, she came from the stage, and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her. contrast this performance with the restraint, warmth and gentleness of her henriette in "all this, and heaven too" or the pathos she brought to "dark victory." she was a true actress and a true artist. davis really allows herself to look like holy hell; mildred's deterioration is absolutely pathetic as philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades.an excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film's greatest stars.

reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting. i even found a site which claimed that bette davis' success was probably due to her luck. but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite. the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart: fog over frisco and on human bondage. characters she played in these movies, though both being negative, are quite different. arlene in the former is a beautiful, glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter, which is a pale, uneducated and impudent cockney waitress. needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm. but even that is not all. the point is that the former role, which would be wished by most actresses of the day, was the one she was forced to play. the latter role, which seemed to most actresses as undesirable, career destroying role, was the one she fought for ferociously for months. and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars. so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing.the film, which tells about a medical student phillip carey (leslie howard) which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers (bette davis), has a few week points, but many more strong ones. the story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes. for example, it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place. well, there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes, but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved. nevertheless, the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner's music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters' faces. in fact the film is amalgamated by phillip's walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two-tone repetition. every detail is well thought - max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillip's life, which is consistently used through the film. and a beautiful scene in which we see sally's face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes i've ever seen exactly due to francis dee's breathtaking beauty (ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind) as well as steiner's captivating music. camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing.but my strongest objection is that events are presented too two-dimensionally, which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut. the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship, despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her, but they, curiously, finished portrayed as likable characters. after all, mildred always - in her own specific, but still a honest way - lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him. which he just refuses to hear. it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem. he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life. of course, selfish and impudent mildred, after discovering voluntary phillip's bondage to her, did its own share to make his life hell. even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen, it is less than clear why would she burn phillip's money (maugham intended different in his novel). after all, she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne.for modern standards the film is a bit outdated, but each subsequent time you watch it, you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting, fascinating music and original editing, so it does deserve the highest possible mark.

somerset maugham's characters are brought to life in rko's "of human bondage"; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel, with bette davis' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy. otherwise, it's the story of leslie howard (as philip carey); he dreams of becoming a painter, but is told he has no talent for the arts. as the film progresses, mr. howard's struggles, instead, to become a doctor. his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; though successful in medicine, his painting seemed easier - also, note the symbolism of his disability, a "club foot" (explained in the film).along the way (right away, in this version), howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis (as mildred rogers). davis' characterization of "mildred" is extraordinary, culminating in a spectacular speech, when she tells howard, among other things, that she had to "wipe my mouth!" after kissing him. howard also performs well, but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis; so, their performances are wasted. still, a film to watch for the acting, including some good supporting players. bette davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a "write-in" campaign for the 1934 "best actress" academy award. for the record, she placed third. the results were: 1. claudette colbert - "it happened one night" 2. norma shearer - "the barretts of wimpole street" 3. bette davis - "of human bondage" 4. grace moore - "one night of love" ******* of human bondage (6/28/34) john cromwell ~ leslie howard, bette davis, reginald denny

the movie may be great. i just watched it last night, but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first. the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film. if you plan to watch "of human bondage," don't read the book beforehand. on the other hand, the book is so good, and contains so much more than the love affair phillip has with mildred, you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie. i do not make this claim lightly. i average reading a book every 4 days, and read such disparate authors as danielle steel, ovid, faulkner, plato, and shakespeare. "of human bondage" gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written.

bette davis' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players. they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers - they just didn't have as much to do. some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better - it was but to give the film it's due, to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat. the first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen - it told of phillip's childhood, then moved to germany and paris, where phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist. it also chronicles his first romance - with fanny price, who kills herself when she realises phillip cannot return her feelings of love. it is a wonderful book but rambling and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is.after realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter, phillip carey (leslie howard) comes back to england hoping to take up medicine. when out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, mildred (bette davis). even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, phillip is obsessed. it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room, when they almost miss each other, she berates him with "why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available". you just want to shake him. the only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man, a coarse sales- man, emile miller (alan hale). with mildred out of the picture, he meets nora (kay johnson) a lovely woman, who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants (in the novel he had seen mildred reading them.) nora gives phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love. when mildred returns (miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby), of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby (in the film it is treated as an object - always called "baby", never given a name or gender) - she repays him by running off with his best friend.at the hospital he meets sally athelny (frances dee) who is visiting her sick father. he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family. then surprise! surprise! mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise! philip takes her in. but he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how. then follows one of the most vicious, verbal fights on film with phrases such as "you cad, you dirty swine", "i only kissed you because you begged me" and "when you went i wiped my mouth, i wiped my mouth"!!! in the book a lot of mildred's stock phrases such as "you're a gentleman in every sense of the word", "i don't mind", and "mr. high and mighty" were associated with prostitutes and when phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that.the end of the film shows phillip (being truly free of mildred in the only way possible) now free to love sally. again in the book sally tells phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love. that ending, like mildred's "sickness" could not be in the film - even a pre-code one.kay johnson was always called on to play sensible, believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself. her nora was the woman philip should have stayed with. frances dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues. she was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face ("the silver cord" and "blood money") but when she married joel mccrea her career started to peter out. her sally did not push her talent to the limits. apparently leslie howard was not very helpful to bette davis on the set - he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part. he used to throw her her lines "whilst reading a book off camera". he did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported "the kid was running away with the picture"!!!highly, highly recommended.

this 1934 adaptation of somerset maugham's novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress. she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on loan, so her studio didn't push for her. her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards. as the heartless waitress who jerks philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, davis is way too shrill, almost demonic. director john cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one. davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. i imagine the character of millie as quieter, less feminine than davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy. davis is such a strong, immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her, which makes philip's attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be.as philip, leslie howard is excellent. his wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete. nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part, as, say, dirk bogarde might have done, which gives his work a rare clarity. he seems completely in control here, as he should be, playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy, as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand. howard was a fine actor, too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm, which he doesn't use here.it's been so long since i've read the book i don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it. i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough, and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey. the sexual undercurrents are muted, and at times philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity, surely not mr. maugham's intention. thanks to howard's performance, philip remains firmly in focus, as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational, in himself and in others. overall, a very good film, a little stilted at times, due to its age, it evokes london nicely, and is well acted for the most part.

i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about cary's [leslie howard] childhood. considering thatat the time not much can be shown on the screen, [not that there is much in the novel] the obsession of the character with mildred [bette davis] is very well conveyed to the audience. i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her. i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale, but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked. one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a goodadaptation of a part of it at least.

bette davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film. the film seems rather dated now in 2003. it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. it was startling for me to see how young ms. davis looks in this move. the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. leslie howard is well cast as philip carey, the club-footed medical student. this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why. however, "of human bondage" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. i have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. you be the judge!

the story is somewhat stilted, what with the main character's sudden reversals of fortune, but leslie howard and bette davis's portrayals of philip carey, the naïve obsessed lover and mildred rogers, the unworthy object of his affections, raise this film considerably above standard melodrama.sensitive, cultured philip, who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years later--ashley wilkes, the southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough reconstruction era. philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before mildred enters the picturehe doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he'll never make it as a painter. it is perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he does.although leslie howard is memorable, today "of human bondage" is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture, perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred, and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy. mildred may have a grating voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel, making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did. although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional, she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. one may also think she is on to something when she accuses philip of looking down on her for not being "fine" enough. (the scene in which philip and norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this).most of the supporting characters are also effective, particularly norah the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has mildred's beauty and norah's decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end. the only character i found hollow was sally's eccentric, ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era.a classic that deserves it reputation.

i just saw "of human bondage" for the first time a few days ago and wow! what a mysterious and almost spooky film. i loved how the music went with the pace of each step of philip's feet. it gave me the chills for some reason...one of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see bette davis coming into herself right before your eyes. she's great, not necessarily because this is her best work, but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious, gritty, and unflinching as an actress in 1934... bette was a risk taker, always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it. if you're a true lover of film, it's amazing to see...she just had a way of delivering a line that made the part, and the film for that matter, belong to her. like "a mass of music and fire. that's me...an old kazoo and some sparklers" or "but you are blanche, you are in that chair!" or "with all my heart, i still love the man i killed!!"... those are from a few of her films, but you get my drift. she was just so brave, sassy, and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes. after seeing this, i can't believe it was remade twice...leslie howard was gorgeous...so calm and persistent, needing to be loved. i thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him, but then again, everyone was...except mildred. he did a great job...the only thing that i didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films. they'd make a character so hateful that it's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place. the performances were great, but in real life, philip would have never been interested in mildred. that's just the simple truth... see it!!

this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'the prsoner of zenda'. set in a london that only hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by somerset maughan.i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. so i bought it. well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh. bette davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. it was impossible to take her character seriously. it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke 'mary poppins' cockney accent but close.in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly. he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well. worth watching despite ms davis' vocal gymnastics.

bette davis' cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling. i totally understand that americans and other nationalities mightn't realise this and that's fine; but believe me, it's about half as good as dick van dyke's cockney accent in mary poppins, and that was a right load of old pony (slipped into london vernacular there - many apologies).the remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles don't detract from the films' power. of human bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults. it also has to be viewed in perspective. the technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated, and given those limitations john cromwell does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop cinematically rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue. a fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at victoria station. it is beautifully conceived, shot and edited. note too the stark shots of the prostrate mildred towards the end of the film; they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised, formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate.the themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones: sexual obsession, unrequited love, scorned passion, self-loathing, manipulative relationships, social divides and youthful folly. though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed, the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is tackled well albeit in a low-key way. some of the scenes of obsession and emotional rejection are uncomfortable to watch but the story doesn't descend into cliché; we're aware that the characters (even the poisonous mildred) are both victims and perpetrators, and that their actions are motivated by their misunderstanding of each others feelings as well as by wilful selfishness. whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating exchanges don't diminish the veracity of the work.of human bondage was one of the films that got bette davis noticed in hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career. her unconventional beauty and screen charisma (no one flounced or did disdain quite like ms davis) grab your attention from her first appearance. whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film, leslie howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student philip carey. they are a good combination, though, why oh why didn't he help her with that terrible, terrible accent!?

the movie concerns about philip(leslie howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student .he falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called mildred(bette davis).she leaves him ,engaging with others(alan hale,reginald denny).meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(kay johnson,frances dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.easily the best and first of numerous films versions of somerset maugham's novel. bette davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance ,absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale.davis rose the stardom with her performance.her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting . leslie howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance.he was an awesome actor(gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during wwii. both will play again in ¨petrified forest¨(1936). the atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the rko(radio picture inc) studio is entirely convincing. remade in 1946 by edmund goulding, with eleanor parker and paul henreid; and in 1964 by ken hughes with kim novak and laurence harvey . the motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. rating : very good but a little bit dated.

enjoyable in spite of leslie howard's performance. mr. howard plays philip as a flat, uninteresting character. one is supposed to feel sorry for this man; however, i find myself cheering bette davis' mildred. ms. davis gives one her finest performances (she received an academy award nomination). thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life. **be sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him.

this movie is about sexual obsession. bette davis plays mildred. this is a woman who men are drawn to. not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. she works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. he dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. he is constantly thinking about her. his med school grades are even failing. so what the nookie is too good. he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. he is heart broken but he meets another woman. they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo. mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred. well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. finally sally and her dad takes him in. not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill. soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again. she has tb. meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally. i wished she told him to stuff it. now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. but i feel phillip was the bad guy. yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it, and he keeps coming back. mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. i guess the sex wasn't as good. but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred. not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy. sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred.

i happen to like leslie howard, in his better films. yet, for some reason, his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously. i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed. this is not usually the case (off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed, if he and scarlett o'hara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell - but ashley loved melonie, not scarlett). howard could play any type, and a role like r. j. mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayed.*(*one can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49th parallel, but they are nazis who consider him - a liberal, westerner, canadian - fair game to double cross in wartime. it isn't the same as emotional betrayal, and howard does not shrivel up as a result, but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up.) i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful - or try to be soulful. witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in the petrified forrest. but that character was not betrayed, except by history perhaps (as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart). the character of philip carey in somerset maugham's of human bondage is soulful too. he is sensitive for several reasons. he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter - but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent. so he decides to concentrate on medical studies, accentuated by a club foot condition he has. here he is a man with low self-esteem who is set up to be betrayed.philip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress (bette davis) who is mercenary and as selfish as they come. why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film, but he does find the woman fascinating. and she finds him an easy meal ticket. ironically in being so captivated by this slut, philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him (kay johnson and frances dee), and are more fit to be his mate. he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men (alan hale and reginald denny - the latter a friend of howard's). although howard's performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred, he really does not show enough passion (until late in the movie, when he turns on her). that is why i find i never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality. his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland, not vivian leigh, has more consistency with a man in love. but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important. she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934, like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouse-like secretary in three on a match. as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch.curiously her performance was not all of one note. while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film, culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her, her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating, and her inability to keep any honest jobs. when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes (he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad, which is hardly the response she expects). in the end howard does finally get his life in order, but mildred ends a casualty (ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call). the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in 1934 (leading to the largest write - in campaign in it's history, and a permanent change in it's rules), but davis was established as a star. in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous. and in two years she co-starred with howard again (as equal stars) in the petrified forrest.

every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing. before davis co-stars with leslie howard in "of human bondage," she'd been in over a score of movies. legend has it that davis was 'robbed' of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress, unwed mother & manipulative boyfriend-user, mildred rogers. the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in "dangerous." i imagine davis' fans of "of human bondage" who agree with the oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critique's contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didn't award her performance & the 1936 film "dangerous," performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937.i've tried to view all of bette davis' motion pictures, tv interviews, videos, advertisements for wwii & tv performances in popular series. in hindsight, it is easy to recognize why this film, "of human bondage," gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. she was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach hollywood's red carpet. the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in "of human bondage." that is what makes it her legendary performance. but, rko saw her greatness in "the man who played god," & borrowed her from warners to play rogers.i'm going to go with the afi, in hindsight, some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for "dangerous," 2 years later. by doing so, the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywood's most talented 20th century actors. because, from "of human bondage," onward, davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. doubtless, she deserved more than 2 oscars; perhaps as many as 6."dangerous" provides an exemplary contrast in davis' depth of acting characterization. for, it's in "dangerous" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. davis is so good as joyce heath, she's dead-center on the red carpet. whereas in "of human bondage," davis is right off the edge, still on the sidewalk & ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career.perhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor's greatest work.it is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford; a star whose performances still don't measure up to davis'. even anna nicole smith was a 'star'. howard stern is a radio host 'star', too. lots of people on stage & the silver screen are stars. few became great actors. the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-struck.try comparing these two movies as i have, viewing one right after the other. maybe you'll recognize what the afi & i did. davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo & achieved her goal by the time she was 27. she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached . . . yet.had the afi sent her the message that she'd arrived in "of human bondage," davis' life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom, instead.

coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of w. somerset maugham's "of human bondage" titillated countless moviegoers. it has no shock value today, just fine acting.while the cast is excellent, this is bette davis's first great role and one of leslie howard's best performances. howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius. taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college (one, by the way, that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few. perhaps author/physician maugham didn't care for distaff medicos).having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress, mildred rogers, bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago. her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle's. his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply, "i don't mind," a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's plumbing the depths. maugham's mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking, something not clearly brought out here.carey's besotted prostration serves rogers' avaricious need for support of the financial kind. he is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument. no sex here. recognizing that he is getting nowhere, he begins a chaste relationship with norah, a woman who adores him. re-enter mildred, replete with a baby, and in her usual need of being taken care of. exit heartbroken norah. another separation from mildred and carey begins a long-term friendship with sally, abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring.the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham's excellent novel. howard's carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun. mildred is unrestrainedly wicked, a user of the worst kind, her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words (and offers-at one point she promises she'll do "anything [he] wants," a daring statement for the times and one i'm sure audiences fully understood.pre-code it may be but mildred's quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency. the ending is conventional-sin loses, principled behavior triumphs.director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars, one well-established, the other established largely because of this film. the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking.available on dvd.9/10 (for davis's and howard's performances)

how amazing this film is! i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always spellbound by it. the reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young bette davis. she not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, warner brothers (this film was made by r.k.o. radio pictures). she wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in london's soho). her body was so curvy when she was young. get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard. and oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene. howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity. frances dee scores as the sweet, pretty young sally who truly loves him. max steiner's score is both charming and poignant. splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel.

several features of this film immediately date it. the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years. the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques.bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me.somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers. as in so many of her character roles, bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred. leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress.towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them. this scene is possibly meant to be funny, but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film. it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face. and after all as far as we can see (and hope for) it is a happy ending.

this movie, even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving, strong film. bette davis, as the slutty, vicious cockney waitress mildred is absolutely believable. watching her performance is still spellbinding. she makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. leslie howard's performance as the weak, obsessed phillip carey is not as strong, but i don't see how any actor could hold their own against ms. davis's performance. she chews up the scenery in every scene she is in, totally stealing the show. this is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the academy award, but lost. it was shocking for it's day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and mildred's vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. just to see the scene where mildred tells phillip what she really thinks of him ("you cad, you dirty swine....") is still some of the greatest acting i have ever seen on film.

**spoiler alert** w. somerset maugham classic on film about a love obsessed young man who's abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances. leslie howard plays the role of philip carey a sensitive young artiest in paris trying to make a living by selling his paintings. told by a local art expert that his work is not at all good enough to be sold to the art going public philip decides to go back to his native england and study medicine and become a physician in order to help others. philip being born with a club foot is very hypersensitive about his awkward condition and makes up for that by being a very pleasant and friendly person. one afternoon philip is at a local café with a fellow medical student and spots pretty waitress mildred rogers, bette davis, and immediately falls in love with her. mildred at first rebuffs the love-sick philip but later realizing just what a sap he is takes advantage of his feelings for her. mildred has him spend himself into poverty buying her gifts and taking her out to the theater every time she off from work. phlip also falls behind on his studies, by paying so much attention towards mildred, at the medical university and fails his final exams. going into hock buying an engagement ring for mildred in an attempt to ask for her hand in marriage the cold hearted mildred tells the startled philip that she's already engaged to be married to emil miller, alan hale. it turns out that he's one of the customers at the café that she's always flirting with. philip broke and heart-sick slowly get his life back together and later retakes his medical exam and passes it and at the same time finds a new love in nora, fay johnson, a writer for a local love magazine. later to philip's shock and surprise mildred walks back into his life. mildred telling philip that her husband emil, who's child she's carrying, threw her out of the house has the kind and understanding philip take her back at the expense of nora who was very much in love with him. it later turns out that mildred wasn't married to emil but had a child out of wedlock by having an illicit affair with him! emil it turns out was already married. as before mildred takes advantage of philip's kind heart for her and her baby daughter, where he supports them with food medical attention and shelter, to the point where he again goes broke and can't continue his studies ending with her leaving philip; after having a very heated and emotional encounter with him. out on the streets with nowhere to go philip is taken in by mr. athanly, reginald owens, who he once treated at the hospital and falls in love with his daughter sally, frances dee. later philip has his club foot corrected at the medical center and with the help of mr. athenly gets back to being a doctor. it's then when he encounters mildred again who's really at the end of her rope. dying of tuberculosis and having lost her daughter she's all alone with no one to look after her. philip now well to do and respected in medical circles does all he can to help the sick and poor mildred but in the end she succumbed to her illness and passes away.mildred had the love and devotion in philip all those years that he was in love with her but choose to abuse him and have affairs with man who were just like her, cold unfeeling and selfish. in the end mildred got back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive philip: she became both unloved and alone. philip found in the sweet and caring sally everything that mildred wasn't and in the end also found the true love that he was looking for all of his life.

of the three remakes on w. somerset maughan's novel, this one is the best one, and not particularly because what john cromwell brought to the film. the film is worth a look because of the break through performance by bette davis, who as mildred rogers, showed the film industry she was a star. finally, her struggles with jack warner and his studio paid off royally.the film is dominated by mildred from the start. we realize from the beginning that mildred doesn't care for philip and never will. she doesn't hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman. he will be humiliated by mildred again, and again, as she makes no bones about what she really is.poor philip carey, besides of being handicap, is a man who is weak. when he tries to cling onto mildred, she rejects him. it is when mildred returns to him, when she is frail and defeated, that he rises to the occasion, overcoming his own dependency on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood.bette davis gives a fantastic portrayal of mildred. this was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. her disgust toward the kind philip is clear from the onset of their relationship. when she tells him she washes her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie. leslie howard underplayed philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is. frances dee, reginald denny, alan hale and reginald owen, are seen in minor roles.this is bette davis show, and don't you forget it!

after 21 movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with. as mildred rogers, davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howard's affections, and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this, she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo. it also has been widely noted that her performance here, one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable, has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history.at circa 85 minutes, the story moves at a nice pace, telling the story of philip carey (howard) as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again.howard and davis' chemistry is all but non-existent -- davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn't care much for howard's iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse (in character) towards him as mildred. all the same, the two seem awkward with one another; their scenes together remain stiff, only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence. then again, cromwell's direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times -- he tries to fill in some space (whenever davis is not there) with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time (a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee). all much in the style back then. this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being, and in essence, the visual story is a simplified, bare essentials translation of the somerset maugham's novel -- which is saying a lot, since at 600 pages, "of human bondage" would have been indeed hard to film even then.storywise, it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment, since there is no discernible, sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that, mildred never hides her displeasure from the get-go. howard's performance never seems to go through much external emotion -- his eyes are constantly sad, his expression never veers too far away from lost (he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in "the accidental tourist" -- dejected, hurt, and absolutely passive), but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women (played by kay johnson and frances dee) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections. interestingly, johnson's norah, once she realizes carey will never fall for her, is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people -- she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred, and mildred herself is bound to miller (or men who fit the role of provider). in her short but memorable scene, she's the one who holds the essence of the story's moral.

this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be. it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this. the cheesy acting. the poorly written script. the good ol' boys. the ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, cliché, and banal premise. the riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse. it has it all.you will meet familiar characters: gold-digging hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, daddy who knows better but drives son away. and the wife-corpse. propped up. in a pick-up. wow: and the title. several things in our lives have been "texas tragedies" since watching this beauty. everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.

i just saw this movie on hbo, and it was really good...a tragic love story indeed! i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident. it's rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped. the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can heal someone's heart. laura leighton...all of 27 when she made this movie...was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart. unfortunately, since his family is wealthy and her's is not, "problems" develop.it's playing on hbo some more times this month. check out the schedule here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ scheduleservlet?action_detail=detail&focus_id=598947

this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy,i really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv, it would be well worth the time to watch it again

"a guy thing" may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. the plot focuses on paul (jason lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky (julia stiles) lying naked in his bed. before he can figure out what happened, he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen (selma blair) is coming. after that, as you could imagine, chaos ensues.almost every single scene in "a guy thing" delivers loud laughs. the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen. selma blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused. although, she turns out to be more funny than stiles' character, who actually isn't that interesting. of course, not every comedy is perfect.as i said, "a guy thing" is no classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.

on the night of his bachelor party, paul coleman (jason lee) meets the gorgeous dancer becky (julia stiles) in the bar, they drink a lot together and in the next morning, he wakes up with her on the bed. his future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fiancée karen (selma blair) might be arriving in his apartment, and he desperately asks becky to leave his place in a hurry. sooner, he finds that her has crabs, and later, in the preparation of his wedding dinner party, he realizes that becky is the cousin of karen. this is the beginning of a very funny comedy, with hilarious situations. the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor. julia stiles and selma blair, who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous, and jason lee, who is amazingly funny, have good performances. i laughed a lot along the story, but there are some scenes that are really hilarious. for example, when paul finds becky in his bed; when he finds her paints; his imagination in many situations; in the drugstore, trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine; most of the scenes of his neighbor, the minister; when karen calls the department store; or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting paul. i could number many other scenes, but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun. my vote is seven.title (brazil):"louco por elas" ("crazy for them")

romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? you'll see one that's really sappy, and you'll think you want something more realistic. then, you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dull to keep you interested. or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but just fails to make you smile. romantic comedies are tough movies. you go into them with a lot of expectations, and usually, whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you.of course, if you've got a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good, you've got other things on your mind. for you, i say, "go get her, tiger!" for the rest of us, i say, "see _a guy thing_." it's a lot of fun.because _a guy thing_ knows you're going in to this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend that its "guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and it's not his wife!" plot is going to make everyone happy. sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel. _a guy thing_ covers that. what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time, so if you don't the main plotline, you've still got something to make you smile.whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen, like larry miller (pretty woman, best in show), james brolin (traffic), julie hagerty (airplane!), david koechner (saturday night live and conan o'brien regular, dirty work, austin powers ii) or thomas lennon (the state and viva variety), or new faces like shawn hatosy (the faculty), or colin foo (saving silverman), we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation, steal the show, time after time, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days.and that's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along, because it's very sweet and terribly well done. jason lee (mallrats, chasing amy, dogma, etc.) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is.a lot of the success of the movie, though, falls on julia stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears it well. not since, gosh, i don't know when, have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy. of course, it's all in the closeups, the voice, and the subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place.but julie stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity. this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall over each other to make you laugh, and then comes through with a great deal of heart.a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it. we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl. a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge, often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play.for the record, it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it.and guys, i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie. i'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema, i suggest you just say "it's a guy thing," and leave it at that.

i was literally preparing to hate this movie, so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing. overall, the story and gags are contrived, but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off. that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs, and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent, but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter. very few of the film's gags are high-brow, but they made me laugh. as i said, the film has charm and charm can go a long way. the characters are likable, too. i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolin's character, since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in. plus, i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife (who serves as the obstacle in the plot) a total witch. the selma blair character is hardly unlikable, and there's never a scene where i thought to myself, "why did he want to marry her in the first place?" the ending is hollywood-ish, but it could've been much more schmaltzy. the cast is talented. i haven't had a favorable view of most of jason lee's mainstream work. i just loved him so much in kevin smith's films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles. and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles. even in this movie, he doesn't look perfectly comfortable, but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene. but i still miss his work in independent films. julia stiles proves again why she's so damn likable. of course, she's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint, but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality. in other words, her beauty shows inside and out. i don't know the actresses' name, but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious. julie hagerty also has a small part, and she's always enjoyable to watch, which makes me wish she received better roles. i loved her so much in "airplane" and "lost in america" that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills. don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records. this is a funny, charming film. romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet, so it's always to see a good one among all these bad apples. my score: 7 (out of 10)

this movie starts out brisk, has some slow moments in the middle, but generally moves along well, has a few very good moments, then peters out at the end of act 3. i was able to get to see this in la premieres 2 times (with 2 different endings). jason lee is a star, but he is not tomorrows leading man. he is humorous and holds his own, but he is better served as a supporting actor. julia stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new for her, but she doesn't 'steal' this movie, the way a star of her caliber should. for an actress who has so much potential(10 things, save the last dance, o), it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so 'average', and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie (like daniel day-lewis did in 'gangs'). selma blair is a good young actress as well, and does an 'ok' job. i didn't expect an academy award performance from her, and she didn't deliver one, but, her performance was adequate. chris koch delivers another film that is 'above average'. perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else. i 'did' like this movie! but, it is not a movie where you walk away and say...'that was great!'...this 'story' has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here. the rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie, and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role (he could be the best surprise of the film). if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times, and have an enjoyable evening, i can still recommend this film, but unless they have changed the ending...again...leave during the church scene, or you will surely be disappointed.

first a quick 'shut up!' to those saying this movie stinks. you can't go to every movie expecting 'citizen kane'. this was actually a fun movie. jason lee is good in everything he does. the only flaw in this movie is, i don't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles. they should have dwelled more on that. other than that, the movie is good fun. selma blair needs to eat something. she's worrying me. but she still looks beautiful. so yes, i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun. go see.rating: **1/2 out of ****

i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really, really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer. it's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie.however, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it's still pretty good. julia stiles is clearly the star, she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee. the rest of the cast, of course, lee's testosterone-filled coworkers, his elegant mother-in-law, his fratlike friend jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place. lee doesn't live up to his costars, i don't think, but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to. maybe that's one source of disappointment.the movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended, is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film. the themes of conformity and "taking the safe route" seemed to cleverly align on several layers. for example, there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice.the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part.while it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent, but overall it's still a good movie.

what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a hawaiian guy bar? all smooth sailing until he takes his "bachelor hat" off. what would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance? a new low, right? well paul coleman, played comically by jason lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. i got to say this is one of his good leading roles. however i do believe his role in vanilla sky was better acted.his finance named karen is played by the up-and-down actress selma blair while karen's character, becky, is played by the lovely and talented julia stiles. getting back to where we left off, paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another. he gets diseases, has to deal with certain people, and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get p.o'ed, including one of his relatives that hasn't had a "bowel movement" for 14 days. *vomit* all of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through.overall, a guy thing is quite funny and is all right. sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it's a mixed movie. and if you're a canadian and a fellow fan of the ctv brett butt sitcom, corner gas, you'd recognize a small role played by fred ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series. this movie is all right. it's another feather in lee's hat (quite an empty hat so far, however).my rating: 7/10eliason a.

paul (jason lee) is an underachiever who just happens to be engaged to a type-a princess named karen (selma blair). she chooses his clothes and his daily schedule. at his bachelor party, paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named becky (julia stiles) back to his digs. "nothing happened", as they say, but the duo do wake up in the same bed. suddenly karen telephones. she's on her way to paul's apartment. understandably, paul hustles becky out of the place, although her underpants are left behind. but, there is even more fun ahead. at a family dinner at karen's parents' home, paul runs smack into becky again, learning that she is karen's cousin. talk about some explaining to do! but, instead, paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom. will karen ever find out that becky spent the night at paul's place? and, what will be the consequences? i'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this. they should definitely lighten up, for this film is fresh and fun. of course, it doesn't hurt matters that lee is a consummate funny man, stiles is a charming beauty or that blair is a natural as a pretty but anal fiancée. the rest of the cast, including james brolin and julie haggerty, is also quite nice. the look of the film is wonderful, as are the costumes and california settings. best of all, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating big laughs for the audience. in short, if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones, get this movie tonight. it may not be academy award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one.

recap: the morning after his bachelor party paul is woken by his mother-in-law-to-be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him. unfortunately its a waitress from the bar, and not his fiancée. and suddenly she turns up everywhere... the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent-in-laws dinner. and it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend had him followed and photographed. it is not only about saving his wedding... it is about survival.comments: actually much better than expected. not the sweet romantic comedy i expected, but something much funnier, something with a little edge. this movie wasn't afraid to take the jokes a little further. and jason lee does now how to deliver comedy, especially when his character is half-panicked and deep in trouble, as he is here. and he got nice support from beautiful ladies julia stiles and selma blair. and actually i thought lochlyn munro did a nice part as the ex.so, more emphasis on comedy than romance, and the end result was good. i enjoyed it very much.7/10

i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments. there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself. apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick...cheers

i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels. my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.in 'a guy thing', jason lee plays paul, a straight-laced, seattle-based fellow who is about to marry his fiancée karen (selma blair) and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle-class domesticity. we first meet paul at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, in case he's a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife. of course, the next thing paul knows, it's the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over. oh, and the hula dancer is karen's cousin becky (julia stiles).from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune, as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure, trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful, family-oriented good guy, who's super-excited about his forthcoming nuptials. his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong-doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun-loving becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him. the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance. definitely worth a watch.

in my opinion, a guy thing is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy. i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law. if you ask me, they lit up the screen like magic. you can also feel their chemistry between them. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the production design was nice, the casting was perfect, and the costumes were perfectly designed. in conclusion, to anyone who's a fan of jason lee or julia stiles, i recommend this movie. you're in for lots of laughs and thrills, so, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

i was very impressed with this small, independently made picture. the story, about a pair of social outcasts who meet, become friends, and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children, is at times hilarious, at times sad, but always provocative. music, mostly by underground bands, was used to great effect, as was the experimentation with camera angles, filters, and slow or fast motion techniques. the performances (the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best i've seen in the last couple of years. if you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot, i really believe you'll appreciate "by hook or by crook".

people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production. i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd, and honestly its one of the best classes i've had, its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated. i originally watched "joy of life" for another class where harry did a voice over in the film, and started watching this film after i started the class. harry originally did some performance work, and is really genuine about creating moments that move you, especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment, but its something you see in this film.

by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers, harry dodge and silas howard. they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and it's beautifully shot by ann t. rosetti, and wonderfully written -- truly poetic. the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. this film has so much energy, so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it. i can't recommend it highly enough! the best butch buddy movie of all time!

what is so taboo about love?! people seem to have major problems with the transgenered.the title of this movie didn't catch my eye. it was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing. i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was. it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way. it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen. i did not view these characters as either gender, just human. i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. especially independent films. praise to all fearless filmmakers!

a great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world. isn't this why we go to the movies? i was especially impressed with the editing and the music, the combination of which was very transportive.

this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places--writing and acting. in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far. in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but, surprising, it rivals film stock for brightness, clarity, and, saturation in brightly lit situations. this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a "midnight cowboy" kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco.

i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. i found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging.what i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.

i saw this movie in 1959 when i was 11 years old at a drive-in theater with my family.way back then, i thought it was very funny . . . even though i was too young to understand 90% of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight! i saw it again this morning on "turner south". as i watched it, i was absolutely convulsed with laughter! "the mating game" is a unique classic from a by-gone age. if you're too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film, i feel very sorry for you. there's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can (even today) deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to "old timers" like me.having said that, all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like "the mating game".movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. and as such, these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand.in other words  if you don't understand the issues the film is addressing, please don't embarrass yourself by offering comments which  frankly  make no sense.

mating game is a charming, wonderful movie from an era gone by. hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie. my wife and i would go see it.it is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on amc.this movie has tony randall at his best. debbie reynolds is great, as always. loved it. we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of movies.too bad hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.hey hollywood....time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe, update them a bit (without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes), and hold a casting call.a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, dvd, and on cable/sattv.sn austin, tx

i have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the u.s. government's yearly demand for taxes. ever read a tax code?: it is quite a trial to follow it's multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups. despite claims that it is fair, the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential. most of the various special clauses are meant for their use - go through the average 1040 or 1040a form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules. most people will never have any use for these.the story here is that a wealthy landowner (philip ober) uses his influence to tip off the irs that his neighbors (paul douglas and una merkle) have not payed taxes in 20 years. the baltimore office of the irs is under fred clarke, and he is snapping to attention for ober with his influence. he sends tony randall to check out the situation.randall finds that douglas, merkle, and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people, who rarely have need for cash (they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors). but randall, trained in the clear (to the irs) lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals. but gradually douglas notes that reynolds is fond of randall, and he keeps sidetracking randall from his chore, eventually getting him drunk. he also makes it difficult for randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed "for repairs" by his two sons.the plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban, vaguely ambitious randall, and countryside, life loving reynolds. they make a cute couple actually. eventually, after ober complains, randall is sent back in disgrace and clarke (a tougher cookie) gets down to brass tacks. and comes up with a very large tax bill, that will possibly ruin douglas's family.the film does not end there - it does end happily, but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy, and that the government does, all too frequently, go in for destruction. a chance in a million reversal saves the family, but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick. more realistic is how clarke's boss, (charles lane) cuts to the essence regarding ober's "help" by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully. after that ober is rather green.

excellent farce! which, of course, is all it is intended to be. thankfully there is neither a social or political message, nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction. could the plot actually take, or have taken place in any particular time or location? unlikely, for, after all, this is simply, merely, a movie, and movies spring from imagination, not from reality. the only goal of this movie is to entertain, certainly not to educate, and entertain it does, with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds. i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity. but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a "no-brainer," which the mating game is in all respects. for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then, this is fine fare fantasy.

if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is not for you. nope--you'll hate it. however, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this slight film.tony randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. they dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, debbie reynolds. that's really about all the plot there is. but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting. a really nice little curio from the late 1950s.

many critics have felt offended that r.w. fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human-like manner. connoisseurs of other fassbinder films, however, will realize that "lili marleen" (1981) belongs to fassbinder's "women movies" like "the marriage of maria braun" (1979) and "lola" (1981). fassbinder was convinced that "stories can be told much better with women than with men", because, according to fassbinder, while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society, "women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner". dialectics, however, means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black-and-white world, but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide. moreover, dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished. concretely speaking: starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state, the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do, and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation, so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender. fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme, that transcends classical logic, in his play "the city, the garbage and the death" (1975) which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title "shadow of angels" (1976).therefore, approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany, in a dialectic manner, the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial, especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light-switch schema, but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis. the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized, since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones. in a synthetic viewpoint, the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness. they are mutually related. in a world-view based on classical logic, a relation between good and bad cannot even been established, and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic, the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany, feeling (illogically enough) responsible for the deeds of their ancestors, exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well. from fassbinder's dialectic viewpoint, it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their "misuse" of the ruling system for their private purposes, because they don't misuse them, they just use them. in the opposite, since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims, because "good" and "bad" are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two-valued logic, their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world, that is not black and white at all, much better than a black-and-white logic.

i consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. first, it describes a face of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies. in particular, german soldiers, army and the nazi government are shown more "humanized". one of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze. another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. and the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. have you noticed that?

kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie, although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version. they're both good in different ways. kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting, almost, though. and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better, too...she was more believably sweet and sentimental. there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version, though, like how the humorous side is more apparent.

as winter approaches, our state-owned broadcaster, the abc, has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights. this commenced with a twelve-year old movie length version of "emma" last sunday; more recent versions of three other novels, "persuasion", "northanger abbey" and "mansfield park" are to come.the curious thing about this production by a&e television networks, with script by the ever-reliable andrew davies, is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions, one starring gwyneth paltrow, and "clueless", a "modernized" version, starring alicia silverstone, which transported the plot to beverly hills. perhaps as a result, even with kate beckinsale in the lead, this production sank without trace.as a general rule, much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length. the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters. an outstanding example is "brideshead revisited" which had 13 50-minute episodes back in 1982. you only have to compare the very ordinary movie-length version of "pride and prejudice" in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six-part tv mini-series. it's not that a novel should be filmed page by page, and some novels (often not very good ones) adapt wonderfully to film ("atonement" is a recent example), but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm.given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation, this production is ok. kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self-assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly (he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters  knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p&p). samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly  sybil fawlty on speed. bernard hepton as emma's feeble father was also excellent. we saw the damp countryside, the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors, in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody.even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted, even allowing for the formalities of the times. i'd have to look at the film again to be sure, but it might be due to the under-use of reaction shots.if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example, and compares well with the paltrow version. anyway, there is more to come!

this is the best emma in existence in my opinion. having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and read the book, i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece. the 1996 movie with g. paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. it's very light and fluffy, you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie, that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points, such as the churchill/fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent. but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 tv version is the superior. emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed. kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character. you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith, yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending. you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims. for emma, it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage. for frank churchill, it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. in the book, she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made. both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult. both versions are very good but i prefer this one.

the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice. the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much. the language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice. i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television. i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior. an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!

i really loved this version of emma the best. kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly. the only complaint that i had was on mr. woodhouse..i can't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life..she was a smart girl in the end though. as always, i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot. the settings are so spectular. it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as ireland and scotland) i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emma's most excellently! i am glad that i got to see this one as well.

until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon jane austen's "emma". then two came along in the same year, 1996. or, if you count 1995's "clueless", which updates austen's plot to a modern american high school, three in two years. the main character is emma woodhouse, a young lady from a well-to-do family in regency england. she is, financially, considerably better off than most austen heroines such as elizabeth bennett or fanny price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. she persuades her friend harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, robert martin, believing that harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman mr elton. this scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as elton has no interest in harriet, but has fallen in love with emma herself. the speed with which emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. this being a jane austen plot, emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications. today in 2008 kate beckinsale is a hollywood star, but in 1996, despite being only a year younger, was not nearly as well-known internationally as gwyneth paltrow. she is, however, just as convincing as austen's well-intentioned but often wrong-headed heroine. beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles- she made a delightful hero in kenneth branagh's version of "much ado about nothing"- and i sometimes find myself wishing that hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in turkeys like "pearl harbor" or "underworld". i preferred jeremy northam to mark strong as emma's love interest mr knightley, largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a gentlemanly, chivalrous older man, in some ways more of a father-figure to emma than a lover. (his surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). strong tends to downplay the question of the age difference (he is 37, she 21) and makes knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does northam. samantha morton (another actress who would go on to bigger things) is perhaps closer to the harriet of the novel than was toni collette.this was the more small-scale of the two versions, being made for television rather than the cinema, and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast. costume drama, however, is generally something that british television does well, and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version; both are entertaining and well-made versions of austen's novel. 7/10

old jane's mannered tale seems very popular these days. i have lost count of the number of versions going around. probably the reason is that her "ruts" are our "ruts" even at this late date. this tv mini-series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel. headstrong, opinionated emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, even though the ambience of jane austen's world may seem a tad artificial to us today. if you haven't seem emma, i'll only say that self-sufficient emma does get her comeuppance. it's worth watching to find out how. the acting honours here go to the ladies: kate, prunella, lucy and samantha. they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane!

kate beckinsale steals the show! bravo! too bad knightly ins't as good looking as jeremy northam. mark strong did a fabulous job. bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father. i love the end scene (which is an addition to the novel-but well written) when the harvest is in and knightly dines with his workers and high society friends. emma must show that she accepts this now. she is a changed woman. that is too much too quick, but ok. i'll buy into it. samantha bond plays emma's ex-governess and confidant. she is wonderful. just as i would have imagined her. i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best. american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality. see this one!

it has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately i don't seem to be able to rent it in the video store, only the other version but i fell in love with it. i was always borderline with the other emma. gwenneth and toni collette, as they are not british naturally have to put on the accent, and well to me it doesn't seem natural. it seems put on. sorry but don't think toni and gwenneth did a brilliant job there. i could not warm to any of the characters, but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person i imagined emma to be. it is definitely the version i will come back to from now on. i was disappointed that mr knightley was not better looking, but he is convincing. i also like jane fairfax better (played by olivia williams). i never warmed to her in the movie version, but she is better portrayed in this version. come to think of it, (besides mr knightley) all characters are better played, and a lot less over the top. unfortunately both came out around same time and the paltrow version got more publicity. pity...... i also love the new scene at the end. well done to kate beckingsale! therefore, if you are a jane austen fan, don't forget to watch this one.

i've really enjoyed this adaptation of "emma".i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again.though it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the novel plot and sub-plots were developed in a satisfactory way. all the characters are well-portrayed. most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompson's sense and sensibility.as a foreigner, i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. the setting and costumes were beautiful. i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries "pride and prejudice" but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying "emma" of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no-one but her would love. she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable. mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley, not an easy part, i think, though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth's mr darcy in pride and prejudice. even the end scene (the harvest festival) which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity, had she been in his situation. a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film. i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen's novels.

this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel. although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "pride and prejudice," "emma" is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel -- especially considering its short length. the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book. i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked. kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version. samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book. mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected, sumptuous film.

i've seen this movie after watching paltrow's version. i've found that one a very good one, and i thought this would not be as good... but i was wrong: british version was far better and enjoyable! i found jeremy northam more "agreeable" than mark strong, but i can say that strong catches much better austen's knightley. anyway, both versions are good,but anyone that loved austen's books, should watch this movie. i agree with *caalling*: andrew davies changed a few things, but still remains faithful to the original.10 out of 10my 2 cents!

of the spate of austen films from the 1990s, this is my favorite, more even than "persuasion," which was the one that converted me to austeniana. before seeing this "emma" i had seen two previous versions, but in one emma seemed all wrong, more like lady teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, whereas here she seemed just right, young and silly and stubborn. in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well; indeed it is one of the sweetest, merriest things i have ever seen, rather in the nature of a christmas treat. the script is unusually well formed, and the adapter's additions, like the shaft of light that reveals harriet to emma in church, are all in keeping. mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected, but i enjoyed him very much: he strongly brings out the plain-spoken, practical side of the character, in contrast with emma's affectations, and his choleric outbursts against frank churchill are quite funny. bernard hepton makes mr. woodhouse a figure of almost carrollian absurdity; samantha morton as emma's protégé is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be. and as in the same producers' "pride and prejudice," care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed--uniquely in some cases. for me this production was and remains a delight.

kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv-adaptation of jane austen´s novel. when i read that novel i was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story: for honestly, she is so terribly self-righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously. kate beckinsale´s interpretation, however, saves emma from herself so to speak: she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one can´t help but give in and like (not to say love) her in spite of her less amiable qualities. kate beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this tv-series is so delightful; raymond coulthard is perfect as mr. frank churchill, expressing this character´s personal magnetism to the full (which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of emma), and mark strong, samantha morton, bernard hepton, and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles. this production is, in short, a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure.

this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow (although i liked that one, too). it isn't so much that beckinsale is better -- they are both very good -- but that the screenplay is better. davies is a master at adapting austen for filming, and the production values here are very good. it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment, but it's close, and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better.

jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen. kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable. gwyneth paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) is able to bring out the comedy effectively, she fails to make emma likeable. paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part (and i believe the era) and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses. kate beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly (the most romantic of jane austen's heroes) actually sees in her. mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, an appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behaviour. emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful.

i think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and i've seen many... the book is better, but it's still a very good movie!

all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense. as a matter of fact this is the best movie i've ever seen. it's an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best. i would not give criticism to any of the actors. that movie is the best and it will always stay that way.

i never heard of the book, nor care to read it, but the movie i will probably see many times.this film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie. it was as if i was looking at paintings many times, which i think was the idea.terrific movie, story, actors, and cinematography. full of profound emotions from every angle. although i am not particularly fond of romance movies, i loved this and was deeply moved by winona ryder's plea to her father toward the end.mr. irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never better.

can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal, which was to correctly adapt allende's novel? obviously yes. bille august managed to make a superficial, shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events, resulting in total incoherency. i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. and this something was the most important part.

perhaps the best isabel allende's book, house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history, this one full of magic, a mystic veil, plus some kind of omnipresent sadness. this movie gathers a great cast, plus a great art direction, with a script that cannot contain all this book's quality. it's unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie, whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high, and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset, mostly because they understood very little.

well, i said it all in the summary, i simpley adore the movie and the cast...i would give each actor an oscar...great, great movie...i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do, about 2 or 3 times...;) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, jeremy irons also..just brilliant...i wish the movie received more awards... i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it... also, glenn close was fantastic... the story was beautiful and sad at the same time... i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much, and how blanca was close to her parents...

maybe it's because i saw the movie before reading the book, but i really love this movie. i've seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more. it's a compelling story, that's interesting from the beginning to the end. it has everything: action, romance etc.

this is one of the few movies i watched twice in the theatre. i really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero esteban trueba. he makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption. isn't this a rather consoling thought?when i watched it for the first time, i thought that after the won election, the movie would be over - i didn't know the book. so boy was i wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! i was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film.many people here utterly dislike this movie. i cannot understand that one single bit. maybe those who read the book first are - as often with screen adaptations of novels - simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold, unseen, unexplained. but as a movie telling a touching story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the strength of love and the insanity of hate (and conservatism) - this movie is simply splendid! furthermore, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well - especially winona ryder and jeremy irons.so definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for!

this movie is an incredible piece of work. it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind, focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them. stellar performances all around. this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight. spend some real time with this one.

at first i didn't didn't like it that much, although i did. they didn't include the third trueba generation, the love between blanca and pedro wans't well explained and some actors were too different from what i had imagined.later i realized that, had the movie been more loyal to the book, it would have been like five hours long, and would be kind of tedious. now i like it very much, because my favourite characters are there as i portraited them. clara really looks like an angel in live, and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic, loyal and short. glenn close is ferula. i pictured her just like that, only not in mourning throughout the whole thing. esteban is find enough. i never really liked his character, and, although i was interested in him, i hated him a lot, more specially when he hit clara. as in the book, the very last part is the most exciting one, and it has real history too there.the movie is really good, specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book. its amazing how many famous stars are there, don't you think so?

the photography of this bid-budget production is surprisingly bad. colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it. direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tv-movie like, too. *and* at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence. hans zimmer's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated, untalented composer.but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story, a sort of european version of edna ferber's family epos giant. while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man, even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by. clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country. her daughter, whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it. the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great. the actors all do a great job, too. i was wondering "who is the actress playing blanca?" all the time, but of course, it was a really young winona ryder!all in all, this movie really made me want to read the book.

could not understand why jeremy irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent, spoken through clenched teeth,and from the back of his throat. in fact it rather spoiled the film for me, and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him (very irritating). no other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst i have always rated jeremy irons as a fine actor, i would not class this film as being one of his best. the film however has whetted my appetite, as have some of the other comments made re this film, which i have found very interesting,and intend to now read the book.

brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of chilean president salvador allende killed. in the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart esteban trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant danish director bille august recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened chilean nation, and whose main character would augusto pinochet (stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace).bille august attends an exceptional cast in the jeremy protruding irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. in esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, solomon describes in these words:"the things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you." unforgettable glenn close playing splint, the tainted sister of stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. meryl streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove clara. with telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as blanca worthy rebel leader pedro segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like stephen jr., the bastard child of senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. the film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like isabel allende and immortalize just bille august.

i liked the movie, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much-longer story. since the book is over 400 pages, that makes sense. it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictional south american country, also a lot to fit into the time available. i think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie.even though it's rushed, the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing. what is told is told fairly well. one fault is that clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie, or they should have been left out. two more faults (which could be spoilers): esteban's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly, and ferula's curse seems to wear off, even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever.the acting is excellent. glenn close, as the tormented spinster ferula, is outstanding. jeremy irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent. meryl streep, as the main character clara, is great, although she's often even better than she was in this movie. there were many well-performed smaller roles too. the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent.

although the story is fictional, it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world. this is the true, pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel / film. the offbeat supranatural stuff, lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie. after all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world. although is not critically acclaimed (probably because of the supranatural stuff), this is an excellent movie, with a great story and great acting.

the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue, south american politics and super-natural powers. meryl streep, glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense. this, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably, while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture. glenn close, as esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country. settings of clara's home and esteban's ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere.

before all, i'd like to point out that i have not read the book, so there was no chance i'd be disappointed in that aspect. the major flaw i spotted was historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. i think don´t belong at that time.***possible spoiler*****the technical aspect of the film is ok, nothing to brag about. but the acting, i think, was terrific. i don't have no experience in acting, still i can't believe how people can consider this terrible! maybe they've only seen two movies (ever), and the other one must have been very good indeed!i specially liked jeremy irons, and really understood his character, someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work, then fights against those who would take his life's work from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side, and he ends up a beaten, disappointed man. irons made this so believable, i sympathized with the character despite his brutality.after jeremy irons, winona ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women, who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (banderas, he had an under-developed part, i think), and glenn close was also very good. meryl streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not up to the standards of the other actors. watch out for miguel guilherme, a fine portuguese actor, between so many stars.in contrast to today's movies, here only the interpretations, only people matter, but at the same time, it is not a pretensious film, too worried trying to be intellectual. the best proof i really liked it, i'm writing a review 7 years later.

hotel du nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which marcel carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill-fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world.the film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.pierre and renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery.hotel du nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment.there is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to hotel du nord to eat,chat etc.marcel carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in 30s and 40s as hotel du nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel.carne,while recreating the life of parisian roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre.hotel du nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism.the 14th july ball scene on the banks of saint martin canal remains a magnificent sequence.the film's immense popularity can be judged from the fact that hotel du nord has been declared as a national monument.

a true classic. beautifully filmed and acted. reveals an area of paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. although the area of 'hotel du nord' and the hotel itself still exists, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and joyful as it once must have been. the film makes one yearn for the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and bittersweetness.

i love this movie, jouvet, arletty, blier, carné... almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail i'd like to shed some light onto: no footage of the real, still standing, hôtel du nord (is it still? i heard it was to be demolished...) has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set, the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks.

this is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/dvd. the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. if you get a chance to see this film, then do. i can't wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.

i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. but no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne. the plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war france or simply idiots? suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! i've only seen a few films with jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn - my trouble is shallow: every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen!a remarkably atmospheric, well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; francois (heurtebise) perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. all in all: wonderful.

"hotel du nord " is the only carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by jacques prévert,but by henri jeanson.janson was much more interested in the jouvet/arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,annabella/aumont.the latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the edith piaf's song "les amants d'un jour",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.what's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal saint-martin settings.this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason.the pimp jouvet tells his protégée raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphère) because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphère,the whore raymonde (wonderful arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole french cinéma:in french :"atmosphère?atmosphère?est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" translation attempt:"atmosphere?atmosphere?have i got an atmosphere face? this is our french "nobody's perfect".

fragile carne, just before his great period. although it is sometimes hesitantly directed, and marred by longueurs, hotel du nord is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french films of the late 1930s, as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director. all of his great virtues are here: the cramped interiors broken up by gliding, complex, delicious camera movements; a melancholy deployment of light and shade; remarkable, wistful sets by alexander trauner, which are so evocative that they, as the title suggests, take on a shaping personality of their own; the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert; a seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time, in this case louis jouvet and arletty.in fact, the film's biggest failing, and i find myself astonished (as someone who usually, didactically, minimises its importance) to admit it, is its script. it has plenty of wit and poignancy, but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacques prevert brought to their best films, it cannot avoid slipping into cliche (even if it is only cliche in hindsight).ostensibly set in the boarding house, the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love, and emotional, metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well. annabella is very beautiful, but not very good at doing tragic, while aumont's callowness, brilliantly appropriate though it may be, by its nature obtrudes any real, felt, romance. maybe it's just me, but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple, so young, so attractive, who, after only a few months, are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other. their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too. of course, this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth, hope and possibility being crushed in france, or maybe france itself, despairing, resigned, waiting for death. for symbols to be truly powerful, they must convince on a narrative level, which, i feel, they don't quite here.what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m. edmond, a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters. although we only learn it gradually, he is a killer in hiding, living off the prostitute played by arletty, having dobbed in his accomplices. in his previous 'role' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite. living a rather aimless life, he is profoundly shaken by the lovers' pact, and becomes fatalistic, realising the folly of trying to cheat death.in this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs, and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - edmond is like a romantic prototype of melville's clinical killers. with one exception - he gives briefly into hope, a delusion which only strenghtens - if that's not too much of an unbearable irony - his fatal resolve.all this could have been trite if it wasn't for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet. i had studied his theatrical work at college, but this was my first taste of his screen talents, and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats - grant, mastroianni, clift, mason, mitchum, cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception (he, needless to say, is allegorical too) than an actual person. edmond begins the film a minor supporting character, but emerges as a tragic hero of some force. like all those major actors, jouvet's brilliance lies in what he conceals.on a formal level, what amazes is carne's grasping, ten years before its flourishing, of the techniques of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk, ophuls, ray and minnelli. although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of sierck's contemporary german melodramas (check out the masterpieces zu neuen ufern and la habenera), carne's style truly fits his theme - that of entrapment, paralysis, resignation.the film's principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve, the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of renoir's open river of possibility, we have a canal, stagnant and manmade, going nowhere. the film begins as it ends, and the setting never changes, except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return. characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy, the walls and frames that hold them captive, the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve. any hope at the end, therefore, is profoundly, if romantically, compromised.

the sea is watching was an interesting film experience. first of all, the overall feel was intense, internalized, claustrophobic, and small. each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside, something very focused and not part of a bigger picture. it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame. the physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity. the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half, and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town. even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind. no panoramic views. in fact, it reminded me of the montmarte sequence of moulin rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening.while the acting was passable considering i really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered, i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical. why kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didn't seem true  people hadn't really changed that much, and the character kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on o-shin's business for naught, the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting. another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of kikuno showed up and ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs, the way in which he got up and menacingly came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the reeds was simply unsatisfying. it wasn't that i like fight scenes  au contraire  but it seemed a little stilted and again, overly dramatic.otherwise, while not a beautiful movie to watch, it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution (as opposed to the geisha). unfortunately, perhaps it fed into our expectations of wanton women (the "honey  i'll give you a deal" comments supported by the over-stretched actions) and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way. but once inside the house, the inner workings became most interesting, vivid and real and provided a scenario i never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of japan in the 19th century.

artistically speaking, this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are gorgeous. in fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by akira kurasawa himself. in this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.so, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was interesting. however, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. it's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in japan, the women still long for a better life. this reminds me a lot of the movie streets of shame, though streets of shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.so, overall it gets a 7--mostly due to everything but the writing. it's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great kurasawa.

the sea is watching has been made from an original akira kurosawa script, and it is indeed a lush and warm film. watching it will be a pleasure !kei kumai as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master (particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting), but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable. another thing that is missed here: kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing.probably that was his magic on set while shooting; and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet.maybe we just miss the eye of the master.this is one lovely and sweet film, but it is no kurosawa. to expect that might well be very silly...

kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any shakespearean drama, and the acting is true to the story, with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale. it is touching, funny and intriguing in all parts. the character development is near perfect, the cinematography is vivid and engaging, and the story draws you in.i would like to say that the "samurai freaks" and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa's best work. perhaps not his best, but even at his worst, kurosawa is better than many of the best. this story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change, that it is timeless, despite being set in the not-so-distant past.i would heartily recommend this to any movie buff, and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based.

this is a very fine and poetic story. beautiful scenery. magnificent music score. i've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling. the movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors. it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic. japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here. the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director. it's a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody.

this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawa's works, combined with dostoyevski's topics of human psychology (o-shin - sonia marmeladova ), shakespeare's drama and hans christian andersen's tragic and cheerfulness. the screenplay is wondrous, the scenes are colour- and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind. the plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action, so if you don't like all the sentiments you'd also come to your costs - . it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them, but about life, work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time. a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.

it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place. first of all, these ladies are not geisha, they are oiran (prostitutes)in the yoshiwara-type "green houses", circa 1860, give or take.. this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware. the film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and that of others in their immediate environment. that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music, make for a lovely ride. just plug it in, suspend your disbelief and enter their world. you won't be disappointed.

this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions,muti-billion dollar computer graphics,or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie, all you need is a excellent story line and plot. which the master of all japanese films,akira kurosawa pulls off brilliantly. i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece. and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works. 10/10

i'm not sure how i missed this one when it first came out, but i am glad to have finally seen it.this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho, japan. it tells the tale of prostitution, caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan.it is uniquely akira kurosawa! even though he died before he could direct this movie, his adaptation of the screenplay shows. his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other. the characters may revolve around each other, but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in. the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute's world goes back to his life, while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system..lowest of the low. many prize the world of the samurai above all others, but yet, it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint. the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one, while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones. the movie deserves a higher rating. it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan. during this time frame, men were thought to be the survivors..the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property. this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival, and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has.i recommend "the sea is watching" to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if they're not a fan. it is a lovely, quiet and soul sustaining movie, and one to be treasured for any movie collection.

'umi wa miteita' ('the sea is watching') was akira kurasawa's swansong to film: his adaptation of his favored novelist shugoro yamamoto's story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career. director kei kumai pays homage to both kurosawa and yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image.set in 19th century japan, the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men. the house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers. each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha. oshin (nagiko tono) supports her family who live in a neighboring village, kikuno (misa shimizu) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste. oshin befriends an endangered samurai, falls in love with the gentle fellow, only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with oshin to marry his promised betrothed. oshin's heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically/monetarily by kikuno and the other geishas.a handsome samurai ryosuke (masatoshi nagase) enters oshin's life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her. kikuno is beset by problems, deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her, and coping with a rich but abusive customer. all the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street, oshin and kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by ryosuke. the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice, love, and devotion. the sea is watching and will find protection for true love.the photography by kazuo okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful: night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent. the acting is a bit strained for edo art, but the characters are well created and keep the story credible. the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track. but in the end there is enough of kurosawa's influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema. grady harp

my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much. the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan, while at the same time exposed to very current themes. the characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and story, which is very refreshing. the story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan.

a tragically wonderful movie... brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore. despite hollywood's technical expertise, i have yet to see a (hollywood) movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea... tom cruise's the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old japan.if you like serene but intense story lines, this is a must see film. it will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw. i think this is one of kurosawa's better stories.even if it's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings, it did not turn into a skin flick. the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.

a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors, such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono. after 15 minutes of watching, your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters. this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience, it takes you in, it makes you a part of the story... costumes and settings are brilliant; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built. it is definitely not very akira kurosawa, however it still gets a lot from the master, especially the stylistic story telling tells us we're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance.

i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge.first of all, those girls are not geisha, but brothel tenants, and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie, and certainly not the end. this is a complete art work about the women's life and needs in this era. everything is important, and certainly the way they dress, all over the movie means more than words. to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality. this is kurosawa's work of is life, and i'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual range.

contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. they are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women. i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. the themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting. i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse. the actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. it's a great example of both.

i really liked this movie, and went back to see it two times more within a week.ms. detmers nailed the performance - she was like a hungry cat on the prowl, toying with her prey. she lashes out in rage and lust, taking a "too young" lover, and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fiancé's mother's pieces of fine china to the floor. the film was full of beautiful touches. the maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the rooftops. i particularly enjoyed the ancient greek class and the recitation of 'antigone'.it had a feeling of 'story of o' - that is, where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure. as she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff, she is at ease - and why not, what is to restrain a "devil in the flesh"?the whole movie is a real treat!

the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as 9 and a half weeks...the courtroom scene itself...with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm...is amazing...i have not seen this movie in 20 years...but it made indelible pictures in my mind...it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity, and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all....the plot is european, and it meanders a bit, but so does life...especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on....

notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lover's penis from his trousers and into her mouth. even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride. detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged, insatiable delight, wandering about her flat nude. dressed, partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released, she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps, beautifully of course!

i loved the the film. it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed. for instance, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth.for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film. a great pity.the one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on about, does the film no harm.

bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie, a description of the revolutionary movement in italy, but that seems more metaphor than reality. well, almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor. the revolutionaries, of whom we see and about whom we learn very little, might as well be mafiosi. out with the old and in with the new.andrea's papa, a psychoanalyst, seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values -- morally upright, unperturbed, clean and tidy, thoroughly ritualized.giullia, the girlfriend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands. (i'm guessing here.) andrea, the adolescent boy, seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way "upatz." he's respectful of his father but disobedient too. he loves giullia, or so we assume, although he's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally, but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams. his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as "media." he's the man in between, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming.most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from "antigone," which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will.that brings us -- by no particular course that i'm aware of -- to marushka detmars. she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago. two hippos are neck-deep in the river, staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank, and one hippo says to the other, "i hate her." she's a good actress. (let me get that out of the way.) but so is everyone else in the film. she carries with her, in her speech and manner, the rich glitter of outright lunacy. and it all comes from the actress too, not from directorial aid. detmars isn't nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in "repulsion." the walls don't turn to rubber and grow hands. instead, we see her animated -- sometimes too animated. and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening.a critic described her as sultry, but that's probably not the word he was searching for. she's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair, her wide white ready grin, her impulsive giggles. and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs. the sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one of them is explicit, but because we've gotten to know the characters involved. (it's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick.) actually there isn't that much sex. there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time. at least real time for an eighteen-year-old boy.the young man who plays andrea is fine too, which is a necessary thing, because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia. they have to carry it and they do. if it were not for their performances, i'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is. it could easily have been turned into a rather slow, boring romance.worth it.

i'll be quick to address the matters of the film here: it was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all-consuming passions; a young italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her jailed political-radical fiancé (due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life) finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with. the anxieties, rage, tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads. it lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of italian politics during the 80's). i found the film compelling...what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead...it isn't simulated and leaves little to the imagination. there are other scenes of sex in the film, which i do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in. but the oral sex scene, i feel, derails the focus on the actual story. it was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears (which caused much hoopla back in its day), it's like hitting a roadblock. it's jarring and unnecessary and i am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it. and what's unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film, which i believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface, emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext.overall: wonderful film hampered by a much not-needed sex scene.

this 1986 italian-french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early, and doesn't let us come up for air. the story is about a high-school student (federico pitzalis) who can't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers) who lives next door to the school. one day, he follows her, and his persistence pays off. there's only one problem: she's engaged to a sketchy character (riccardo de torrebruna) who may or may not have committed a heinous crime, and if he repents, will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist. also, the young woman is a little "funny in the head", and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. giulia's emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires. hot, hot, hot, from the word go, with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers, who plays us like a yo-yo (as she does the boy) from scene to scene, with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until--and even after--the end. available in r and x (!) rated versions.

if jean renoir's first film "whirlpool of fate" first takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards. put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great "grand illusion" and "rules of the game." this is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film's interiors, and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well, particularly from werner krauss' muffat. but the glamorous and sultry ms. hessling, who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness, never goes beyond a one note, selfish harlot portrayal. perhaps this is in part a problem with the script, which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; not having read the novel i'm not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not.still, the differences between nana's suitors are well-drawn, and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelo's vandeuvres -- the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other, particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat, and we wonder if violence will erupt -- this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has.far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just shy overall of "whirlpool of fate", this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally.

this is the first jean renoir silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best, besides being also his first major work. overall, it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only renoir’s sophomore effort. for fans of the director, it is full of interesting hints at future renoir movies especially the diary of a chambermaid (1946) and the golden coach (1952) – in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her – but also the rules of the game (1939) – showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters' backs are turned away from them – and french cancan (1955) – nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point. personally, i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to g.w. pabst’s pandora’s box (1928), josef von sternberg’s the blue angel (1930) and max ophuls’ lola montes (1955) in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan.having said all that, the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release – a “mad undertaking” as renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which, not only personally cost him a fortune (he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father’s paintings), but almost made him give up the cinema for good! stylistically, nana is quite different from renoir’s sound work and owes a particular debt to erich von stroheim’s foolish wives (1922), a film renoir greatly admired – and, on a personal note, one which i really ought to revisit presto (having owned the kino dvd of it and the other von stroheims for 4 years now). anyway, nana is certainly not without its flaws: a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences (the horse race around the mid-point in particular) going on too long.the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times – particularly that of catherine hessling’s nana and raymond guerin-catelain’s georges hugon (one of her various suitors)…although, technically, they are being their characters i.e. a bad actress (who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage) and an immature weakling, respectively. however, like anna magnani in the golden coach, hessling (renoir’s wife at the time, by the way) is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as “the epitome of elegance” (as another admirer describes her at one stage) who is able to enslave every man she meets. other notables in the cast are “dr. caligari” himself, werner krauss (as nana’s most fervent devotee, count muffat), jean angelo (as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of nana’s) and future distinguished film director claude autant-lara (billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here) as muffat’s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter’s neglected wife! the print i watched – via lionsgate’s “jean renoir 3-disc collector’s edition” – is, for the most part, a lovingly restored and beautifully-tinted one which had been previously available only on french dvd. being based on a classic of french literature (by emile zola, no less), it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy arzner’s in 1934 (with anna sten and lionel atwill and which i own on vhs) and christian-jaque’s in 1955 (with martine carol and charles boyer, which i am not familiar with).

the production quality, cast, premise, authentic new england (waterbury, ct?) locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item. unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star "decent" flick, mostly memorable for what it tried to do.........bring an art house style film mainstream. the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself, and if well done, will satisfy most grownups. jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable. i wondered why she wasn't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury. robert diniro's character was just a bit too contrived. an illiterate, nice guy loser who turns out to actually be, with a little help from jane's character, a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison.this genre has been more successfully handled by "nobody's fool" in the mid 90s and this year's (2003) "about schmidt." i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts.i'll give it an "a" for effort.

i love this movie very much i watched it over and over. i don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it. it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it. it might be a little like "pretty woman" but i haven't seen that and i don't think it's any better than this. i don't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good. as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people don't like it. as for rani mukherjee ( i think thats how you spell her last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!

after a love triangle story in har dil jo pyaar karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick. the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from bharat shah. here director duo abbas-mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures. they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood. but in this cccc they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama. hardly there is a single action scene when preity was being raped by salman's colleague in her apartment, salman slapped him.the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song, story, casting, performances etc. which are required to make a movie hit. but of course for salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him. why? because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la-la-la all around. his role as a rich young businessman who has no-nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive. after all madhubala, a prostitute role performed by preity is amazing. later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention. her facial expressions and body language become more attractive, and focus mainly goes to her. her previous role as a pregnant woman in kya kehna was not that heart-touching as it is here. of course, this can be termed as improvement. then priya, a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result. she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of preity.finally, the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself. in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother. perhaps, many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret. and in this way the scriptwriter of cccc has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives. but still then it is a doubt.

this is a generally nice film, with good story, great actors and great songs. the cinematography was unfortunately bad. one of the film's weakest points is the annoying chain of sequences copied from pretty woman. why? does it hurt to attempt some originality, abbas? mustan? anyone?the film is about a newly married couple, raj and priya (salman - rani). priya cannot conceive after an accident she had during the previous pregnancy, and they finally decide to use a surrogate mother, who will carry their child. they pick madhubala, a vulgar prostitute played by preity zinta. the film is not really realistic, i mean, isn't it easier to adopt? and even if they pick a girl, does it mean the man has to sleep with her? have you heard of insemination? anyway, i guess if the writers had heard of all this, the film wouldn't have been made, so the concept is apparently intentional.salman acts very well. it's nice to see him playing a serious character. but his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love to his wife and how hard he finds it to sleep with another woman. come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. rani is just about ok; she is generally effective and does try to do something with the role but gets completely overshadowed by preity zinta.the film belongs to preity, who steals the show in a big way with her flawless performance. she makes the transformation from a loud prostitute to a sensitive woman easily and naturally. she lives the film, emotes and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. this is one of her career-best performances. there is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries. she just should do more such roles.the film's ending only highlights what i said above. it is tear-jerking, exciting and very well-acted. watch it for preity.7/10 for the film! 10/10 - for preity!

......... and you get chori chori chupke chupke. don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than pretty woman, but it (was) a new topic for bollywood. the topic was accepted but it is far from jism, murder, and julie. to tell you the truth, the topic is presented in a very clean manner. but the plot has it's number of clichés. the beginning of the movie is presented in a very "filmi" way. there are some very little plot holes. the movie picks up once rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie. otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning. the acting couldn't have been any better. salman khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes lets you down. over here he gave one of the best performances. on top of that his role is written so well, that you applaud every time he solves a problem. rani mukherjee was adequate. throughout the movie, you feel for her character the most, but she is overshadowed by preity zinta. preity zinta is picture perfect. out of the three, she gives everyone a run for their money. its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent. and trust me, madhubala is far from your girl next door. this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high. the supporting cast are like the family you see in hahk, where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here. the songs are pretty nice. the title song is my favorite of them all along with dil tera mera dil (hearts). mehndi mehndi (henna) and dekhne walon ne (look at the world's sight) are two song that fit the film perfectly. preity's cabaret number, diwani diwani (crazy), could've been shortened while no. 1 punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing. otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch.

the year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors. other than mohabbatein and kaho naa pyaar hai nothing stood out. cccc had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around india and abroad. the only information given was that it was a suspense thriller. the film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good. the main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled. salman and preiti give a good performance where salman doesn't actually take is shirt off at all..must be special effects!! rani plays salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. the three main leads confirm, after har di jo pyar karega, they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistry(apparently). salman khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses. rani's character does not know preiti is a prostitute until the end...this kept from her and the rest of the family...the rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you. the songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song. the other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as salmans loving family. abbas mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfully..i say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer!

cccc is the first good film in bollywood of 2001. when i first saw the trailer of the film i thought it would be a nice family movie. i was right. salman khan has given is strongest performance ever. my family weren't too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him. rani and preity are wonderful. the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars. it's about raj (salman khan) and priya meeting and falling in love. they get married and go to switzerland for their honeymoon. when they come back raj and priya find out that priya is pregnant. raj's family are full of joy when they find out especially raj's dada (amrish puri). raj and his family are playing cricket one day and priya has an accident which causes priya to have a miscarriage. raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor, balraj chopra (prem chopra). he tells raj and priya that she can no longer have anymore kids. raj and priya keep this quiet from the family. raj and priya decide to go for surrogacy. surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to raj and priya. raj finds a girl. her name is madhubala (preity zinta). she is a dancer and a prostitute. raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees. raj changes madhubala completley. raj tells priya that he has found a girl. madhubala and priya meet and become friends. they go to switzerland to do this so no one finds out. priya spends the night in a church and raj and madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together. the doctor confirms that madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy. raj tells his family that priya is pregnant. they are happy again. madhubala comes to love raj and she wants him. what happens next? watch cccc to find out. the one thing i didn't like about the film is their idea of surrogacy. they should have done it the proper way in the film but it didn't ruin the film. it was still excellent.the songs of the film are great. my favourites are "chori chori chupke chupke", dekhne walon ne", "deewana hai yeh mann" and "mehndi". the song "mehndi" is very colourful. in that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful. the film deserves 10/10!

a french film ester williams would love. but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves. no question where sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as "animaux" but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background. marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined. she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane ( a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of her body's perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a women's body. what ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural: where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? while the dénouement was breath taking, with floriane's self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne, it all seemed abstract, sciamma's puppets.

in this swimming pool, this pond, there are water lilies and there are frogs. frogs sit on water lilies. the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship. marie(pauline acquart) is a water lily, a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine(adele haenel), a frog, the captain of her team. floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline. but floraine has a secret; the bombshell has a bombshell, which "naissance des pieuvres" reveals to the audience, visually, before she confides in marie.floraine has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a boy.at a party, we see a double-image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make-up in a bathroom mirror. "lolita" is a fata morgana. marie gets to know floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart. while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake, she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking. in the film's most startling scene, the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. floraine wants boys to like her, but she doesn't like boys, seemingly, but it's more important to the frog that she's popular. when the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog remains a frog. the frog can't transform into a water lily, or a princess, because the water lily lost the frog's respect. after their lips unlock, floraine tells marie, "see, it's easy," which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite-of-passage without any strings attached. floraine's beauty is a burden. she carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations. florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet.the other water lily, the other frog, marie's best friend anne(louise blachere) and floraine's frustrated boy-toy francois(warren jacobs), just like any water lily and frog, have a parasitic relationship, too. while floraine uses marie for love, francois uses anne for sex. but that's life; that's the treachery of growing up, in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself. at a mcdonalds, the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow. physical beauty is a currency. marie gets to call the shots because anne, although far from being ugly, is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo. anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation(the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie's flat chest), but the tadpole(marie thinks she's better than anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat. teenaged girls can be brutal to each other.later, in the final shot, "naissance des pieuvres" suggests that marie has a double, too, and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near-future, if it not already has. teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match.

it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team. there are no parents or teachers to speak of, no school, and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.pauline aquart is the youngest of the three, only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. she's kind of odd looking. she's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long, bony limbs, big feet, and no derriere to speak of. she's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.adele haenel is older -- more, well, more developed physically. what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit, sauntering around, teasing the boys, swishing her long blond hair. but she's not what she seems. or is she? i couldn't quite figure it out. the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency. no wonder francois is always sniffing after her.there's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere's character. she's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain, and sensitive about it, and has an intense crush on francois. blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.the movie deals with the relationships between these three, meaning intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings, and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another. this is of course a tricky topic. it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele. not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on, and what little sex there is under the covers, sometimes literally.i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much, partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action, partly because it's complex, and partly because i'm not sure i got it all.let me give an example. okay. adele is the girl the others envy. she's also quite distant and self satisfied. on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all, from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from. she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio. when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team, adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys. a superior and self-indulgent narcissist, you know? but then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin. really? yes, really. pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her. pauline, now drawn sexually to adele, performs the task with subdued relish. now adele would really like to get it on with a man, preferably older and experienced. so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room. the two girls stand there staring at one another, neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other. but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins, reaches up, and kisses adele on the lips. adele steps back, smiling, and says, "there now, that wasn't so bad, was it?", and then walks back into the club.that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele -- but what the hell is going on? initially, adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child, later like a close friend, finally like a potential lover -- and the minute pauline responds, adele walks off satisfied. is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men? does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? i don't know.i've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio, the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity, but i've only skipped her for considerations of space.should you see it? by all means. (just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids.) for men, some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique, this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot.

in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. the three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.

i saw this little belgian gem two days after seeing 'american teen'. make no mistake about it, adolescence is a roller coaster ride, be it american or european. 'naissance des pieuvres' (or as it is being called in the u.s. 'water lillies')is a tale of a young 15 year old girl (played by pauline acquart,who at times resembles a young scarlett johansson)acts the cool, withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team, just to be close to another attractive girl (adele haenel). it's more than obvious that marie is more than attracted to floriane. figuring among all of this is marie's rather plump, unattractive friend, anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age. along the way,we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes (broken hearts,shop lifting,alcohol and/or drug use,casual sex,etc.). this is a quiet little film that takes time to work it's way into your system (michael bay fans,take note:the pacing here is s-l-o-w,so steer clear),but if you have no problem with this, water lillies is a charmer. no rating here,but would pull down a hard "r", due to language,nudity,adult situations.

water lilies is a well-made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship. sciamma works with specialized, slightly sanitized material that is as off-putting to some as it is alluring to others. the film focuses exclusively on three middle-class teenage girls in a tidy new paris suburb. their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team.such distractions as parents, siblings, work and school have been neatly excised from the equation. the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie (pauline acquart), who is not on the team, but thinks she would like to be. marie worships floriane (adèle haenel), an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after. this takes marie away from her former best friend, also a member of the water ballet team, the somewhat plump anne (louise blachère). being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys. floriane, like this film, promises a bit more then she truly offers. marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl: she suffers inwardly. flroiane doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt.marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane. floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations, then, lacking any other friends, her confidante. all the other girls think floriane a slut, an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases, because it leads them on. she suffers the pretty girl's fate of being not a person but an object, and she can't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her, but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap. enlisting marie to act as her pal so her (unseen) mother won't know she's going out to meet boys, she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later. it looked the opposite at first, but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her. anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that's earthier and more real than the other girls'.keeping all external context at bay, sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls' goals and interactions. on the other hand the film's water madness, which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots, makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly. luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever-present goals and avoidances and just do silly, pointless girl things. it's the offbeat moments that give the film life; too bad in a way that there aren't more of them. but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics. along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls, who understandably love to gaze at themselves. there's no great revelation or drama on the way, but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesn't just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends--whom floriane always stops before they go all the way. in a typical irony of this kind of plot, floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie--but marie is the one who holds off, because she knows it won't have the significance to floriane that it will have to her. when it happens, it's a timid, mechanical affair. meanwhile anne has a huge crush on francois (warren jacquin), a male swimmer, but of course he is after floriane. boys are not an element that's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor, but they are just bodies and faces, available studs.

these type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years, making it hard for the movies to still stand out really.also this movie received little publicity, aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little french movie, as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies. the film premiered at cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well.the movie doesn't really stand out from others, since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that "naissance des pieuvres" is a bad one to watch. the movie is certainly a good watch, that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively, in a typical somewhat slow french cinematic pace.it's a coming of age movie, that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid-teenagers. sexuality is a big theme within the movie, which gets handled delicately and subtle. it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one, though perhaps a bit predictable, since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre.this type of french movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty, with deep layers and meanings to it. "naissance des pieuvres" however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. it's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie, due to its subject and visual approach.the movie is also being made realistic by its actors, who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles. the strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments.a good movie on its subject.7/10

the significance of french title of this film, "la naissance des pieuvres" which literally means "the birth of the octopuses", is rather obscure, so it is perhaps not surprising that it has been marketed in english-speaking countries as "water lilies". the "lilies" of the english title are three teenage girls, marie, anne and floriane, who are members of a synchronised swimming team based in the paris suburbs, and the film is a "coming-of-age" drama about the development of their first sexual feelings.one feature of the film, perhaps unusual for a film of this type, is that it concentrates exclusively on relationships between the young people themselves. we see nothing of their parents or their teachers, and very little of the adult world at all. the three girls are very different in appearance, and are portrayed as being very different in character. the shy, retiring marie is slim and petite and appears to be the youngest of the three. anne is something of a plain jane, floriane a glamorous blonde who is very popular with the boys. the three, together with a handsome male swimmer named francois, are involved in what might be described as a love-quadrilateral.anne has fallen in love with francois, but he is smitten with floriane, who seems to return his affections, although he is by no means her only male admirer. indeed, not all of floriane's admirers are male, because marie has a crush on her attractive friend. the film charts the way in which their friendship develops; at first it seems that floriane is simply using marie as a convenient excuse when she is in fact going out to meet boys; her parents presumably object to her dating boys, but have no objection to her going out with female friends. later, however, we realise that, despite floriane's image as the sexy, popular girl who is always the centre of male attention, she actually reciprocates marie's feelings. the film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality. anne, with her short hair and rather chunky figure, looks typically "butch", yet she is the only one of the three main characters who is unambiguously heterosexual, whereas the more conventionally feminine marie and the glamorous floriane are lesbian, or at least bisexual.coming-of-age films are common enough, although most of them tend to avoid the controversial topic of teenage lesbianism. "water lilies", however, deals with its subject-matter in a sensitive way, with three very good performances from its three leading actresses, pauline acquart, adele haenel and louise blachere. the relationships between the characters, especially that between marie and floriane, are complex, and capable of a number of interpretations. (is floriane, for example, simply using marie for sex, or does she genuinely have romantic feelings for her? could floriane's sluttish behaviour with francois and the other boys be just a device to hide her lesbian feelings from the outside world? or even to hide them from herself?) this was the first film made by its young director celine sciamma (only 27 at the time); on this basis she must be regarded as a highly promising newcomer. 7/10

not everything is said in this excellent first feature from céline sciamma. the friendship, the "wanting to fit in", the first sexual feelings... all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes.all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to, say, "thirteen", but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless.a must see, and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door. the soundtrack is a+ by the way.bon cinéma !

the original title means "the birth of the octopuses". i must confess that i do not quite understand this title. the english title is "water lilies". but after having written this, i read the comment by another user: "the title in french is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously." thanks for your explanation.the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex. it is no different for boys. i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures.much of the movie is water ballet. sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards, and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs, with which they will wave and kick in the air. to people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - floriane is the leader of one team of "water lilies". marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training. this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. soon they will walk together. floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then goes away with him for an hour, while marie is waiting for her to return. i took for granted that the couple slept with each other. but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that. i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere. there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane's garbage bag. in it she finds an apple, mostly eaten. and marie proceeds to eat the rest.  there is a parallel scene in another movie, "kazetachi no gogo" (afternoon breezes) by hitoshi yazaki (japan, 1980). this is about adult young females, and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman. she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her. marie says she cannot do this. but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it. and she masturbates on floriane. there is no nudity in this scene. probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of  i would like to quote baudelaire, "les amours enfantines".floriane is played by adèle haenel, who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in "the little devils" by christophe ruggia (2002)  a very underrated movie.

also known as "water lilies" this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex. this story is told at a slow pace and that works very well. it gives plenty of time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow somewhat attached to them.using a small cast puts some extra pressure on the people playing as they all have some more screen time than normal but the people playing in this film handle that well. everyone is completely believable. visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the swimming pool add a nice effect.many films have been made about the same subject though and this one does not really stand out above any of them. it pulls some "standard" pressure methods out of the high hat and works on them. it isn't bad, not at all, but it surely isn't great either and i do feel it could have done better if it had taken some what less explored angles.7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers

i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris. a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers, all of them just at about the same psychologically stages. many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations. it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism, but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story. you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere. i fund the young actresses of talent, special mention with floriane and marie, very convincing. there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressing!

three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation. the base of the triangle is barely there. at the apex is marie, a serious, short and lean tomboy with a belmondo-like facial structure. her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, chubby -- i dare say fat -- and desirous for her first kiss with a boy but not quite ready for her first sexual encounter. because of her chubbiness, boys don't seem interested and it pains her.the other leg of the apex is a beautiful "fille fatale" blonde vamp. she is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level. marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. marie insinuates herself into the life of the vamp using the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. the vamp has a reputation of being a whore, making out with any young male that orbits around her. marie is not phased out by that reputation. put a stress on reputation.the first half is set up. we get to see a lot of synchronized swimming as we become familiar with the three girls. eventually the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy-turvy relations among the three. that's when unexpected things start to happen.it is a trademark of french films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. this one is no exception. here it is about ceilings and the dying. see the film to learn more.the director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful. that women-only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: pretty and feminine on the surface while hard working and competitive underneath. a number of scenes drive this point: elegant moves and smiles for the public, legs kicking ungainly underwater. the title in french is also suggestive: "prieuve", or octopus, suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously.

a bit slow (somehow like a sofia coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age. the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. the music is perfect and the acting is amazing. the camera works beautifully also. i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period. so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.

this film has a special place in my heart, as when i caught it the first time, i was teaching adult literacy. it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time. there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion, and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation. excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work, a great turn by a young martha plimpton, an inspiring story line, and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience.

i am right now in front of the tv, watching casomai. it is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. after that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. it doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. it is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. it is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. it is a simple story of a couple as i said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end!

i now that these days, some people wan't see a movie without movie styling, so much dogma, lars von, watchosky brothers, are changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, casomai is no-one-more-independent-non-american movie, the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage, but much more .. fully of views, lectures and let you thinking ... and i'm sure, you can't fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes. i calculate that don't have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.

the best film about marriage and family. this is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. this decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids. the real intrusion or help of 'friends' -or executioner if we leave-. the real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. the mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality. a couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history.who likes contract marriage? nobody, after the priest tells their own history if they leave the future in another hands, if they don't know what is the marriage. that the problems are true, that the life demand a real engage, guaranties, from each one. that the real victims of the divorce are kids, with real name andrea in the film- or names. that the abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion. that the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families. the gossip of the 'friends', the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of steffania because tomasso lives his life as if he were alone.maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not. steffania and tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, why they like marriage? a truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple: of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives. the family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing. the screenplay is wonderful. the performances are great: steffania and tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! an excellent direction and script. the colors and the management of the cameras, superb.

a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage. the main thrust of the narrative arises from a 'homily' spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan. in it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life. the 'moral' of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out, both now, and in the past, it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends. this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards. it's a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs.

"casomai" was the last movie i've seen before getting married, just last year. it was also the first movie i've searched for, after i was married, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest.sometimes, reality is not that apart from fiction. to all those who wrote that priests like "don camillo" don't exist in real life, i would recommend them to visit my priest pe. nuno westwood, in estoril, portugal :-)to all others, i would only recommend them to see this movie, before and after the "i do!" day :-)rodrigo ribeiro portugal

this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts, i love the final, when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life, but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right, is jut for two, so what are the other persons doing there? the movie embrace you to a new life, to experiences, to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams. also shows you the life itself, hard like it is. but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need. hope this comment works for you. the movie it did worked well for me. i bought the movie by the way ;) take care.

i was very pleased to go and see a "milanese" film shot in milan. alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy.film tells the story of a standard -in career- milanese couple, starting from "the birth" to the death. the birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love. life is hard in the "urbe" of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher, then finally the product: a child, who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because "the selfish effect" typical of a nowadays "metropolis" personality. the advertising environment with all the "creative" under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot. we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle's director.the actors are well chosen, stefania rocca nice and well characterised, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good fabio volo, well known by the "trash" tv serie: le iene.rating: 7/10

"casomai" is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage. the story is very believable in telling the strange see-saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others, which is fairly typical in italy (one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere, though). pavignano and d'alatri were very good at writing, and that is one of the strong points of the movie. acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping. and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded. all in all, a truly deserving movie, probably one of the best italian movies of the year.

this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion, infidelity, juggling work and family.the so called "culture of death" that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think.a must see. i hope it gets distributed as it should.congratulations on the cast and director.two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me!

i guess if a film has magic, i don't need it to be fluid or seamless. it can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. magic in this film: the scene in the library. there are many minor flaws in stanley & iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. both characters are smart. yet stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the u-turn her life took. in both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. it may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. and while these "mysteries" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. i assume no one took the time to rethink the script. even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what de niro, fonda and plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!

well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck. the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations. real americans might appreciate the story line and the action. for all the action and intrigue, fraulein doktor compares favo(u)rably to jacob's ladder.

i remember seeing this film years ago on, i think, bbc2. i would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how i can obtain a copy? as i remember, it was an especially powerful movie, in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks. apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story - which is why i want to view it again! i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market. would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. thanks very much in advance for your assistance. best regards, albany234@googlemail.com

this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60's italian style. from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper' gear, this is a movie that should not be missed. it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. apart from the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes, but for lovers of 60's cinema it should not be an issue. i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs. i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.

excellent film. suzy kendall will hold your interest throughout. has not been shown on american tv for a decade. one scene that has always stayed with me is the german cavalry gas attack. you will find others. hope they soon put it on tape.

i saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago (1969). although i can now only remember bits of it, i long to see it again. the parts i remember, rightly or wrongly, include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy, offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again. there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available. anyone know why? i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.

like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video.i recall seeing it at about age 12 on the "the late show," circa 1972. i too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses. (i don't recall the more horrific bits i've seen described here; they were likely cut out for the tv audience.) but the scenes i really liked were the ones involving the death of lord kitchener aboard the hms hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling, as i recall.don't recall the musical score, but the comments of the others now have me curious. get this one out on video!

luckily, not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv. and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. and it's not just because of the two george's actresses.the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly did hit me. very effective. also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. well, being a case of war, mostly bad.for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must. his work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall. talk about fräulein! let's hope they get this on dvd soon, so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.

there are movies, and there are films. movies are more often than not merely cinematic "candy," whereas films are true works of art. fraulein doktor is certainly well-placed in the latter. as most viewers, i was highly impressed with the battle scenes, but the poignancy of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film. having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of deutschland, all the while in the throes of morphine addiction, die fraulein is treated very shabbily by the german high command despite all of her efforts. the scene in which the doktor is being conveyed in the rear seat of a mercedes benz command auto, alone, desolate, and sobbing is perhaps one of the saddest yet truest depictions of a "spy's" lot in life. only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close. fraulein doktor is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a singular viewing. i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can, and those who have seen it can again (perhaps again and again)enjoy this exceptional motion picture.

fräulein doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has declined in the past 40 years. then, in the late 60s, while the big hollywood studios were on the ropes, italy,france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood's decline. there were the james bond pictures (doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa, it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 cent afternoon admission price), the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns (with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor that never paid the italian producers a dime)and french crime movies that usually went to art houses, with exceptions like the sicilian clan. and there were european co-productions like doctor zhivago and, of course, fräulein doktor. with its big budget for the time, and the world talent involved, fräulein doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.kenneth more, playing a british intelligence officer, has a line in fräulein doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game. the wall being opposite a firing squad, with little chance of the spy winning the game. that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders, in the vietnam war era of 1969.the steamy scenes between suzy kendall and capucine probably did not damage these performers' chances at getting parts in hollywood movies, hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses. fox would no longer co-produce films like the sicilian clan, columbia wouldn't distribute films like belmondo's the night caller. mgm went even further, cutting almost all film production, selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and unloading its borehamwood studio facilty as kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas (where a bally casino gift shop sold mgm memorabilia at giveaway prices, stuff left over from the auction of mgm's prop warehouses).paramount distributed fräulein doktor, but gulf and western's charles bludhorn, who had taken over the company and canned the studio's aged board of directors, unloaded the studio's film library to universal (as i recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another. but that was in the 70s. fräulein doktor with its lesbian scene was buried, with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.kenneth more was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older, especially in the bbc detective series father brown. when he was younger, as in the british movie titanic, he played his standard reserved british officer. in fräulein doktor, he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual, as i recall. it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate, about his role and, of course, those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle. that was some scene, and alberto lattuada showed he was some director, helming this world war i espionage movie, where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.

it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as "dukes of hazzard" and "the hills have eyes" (the new version) can find dvd distributors while older - and far superior works such as this film - are nowhere to be found. with all the on-going debate about the morality (or lack thereof) of warfare, and interest in espionage (consider the multiple jack ryan, bourne, xxx, and "mission: impossible" productions, this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd. true, it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture. but style consideration aside, this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say, and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained. if nothing else, will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd, whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand-alone. i don't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products, but if you are reading this and other comments, please take us seriously. we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, dvds and cds - give us what we want! all that said, if you are reading this and have not seen this film, lobby for it's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about. you will not be disappointed.

i saw this film by chance on the small box. it has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. a lot about fanatical patriotism. a bit of eroticism. i can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!!

i havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but i remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly, this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on saving private ryan, i recommend it strongly.

i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's. the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. the experienced british soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers. the gas clouds move ever closer, finally enveloping the british defenders. the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. suddenly a scream from the defenders... this gas is like no other that they have experienced before.... now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver, i think that you will too!

after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller, madam lili (1969)starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon, i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller. all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis. it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor. once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back. it is, for its time, a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918.it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews! as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.

like other people who commented on "fräulein doktor" i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before. the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginning.to me this is one of the five best movies about wwi (the others are "all quiet on the western front", "paths of glory", "gallipoli" and the post-war "la vie et rien d'autre"). and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks.i only wish i had taped the film.

this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion. this is for many reasons. for example, it takes the series back to some of it's roots. it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence, with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis. this room hasn't been in smallville for a very long time, and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville's past. not to mention, lionels conversations with lex are always admirable.another pleasant return is, well uv guessed it, is bart allen(aka impulse), ac(aka aquaman) and victor stone(aka cyborg). not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers, he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way, that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie.from there you get the basic story, green arrow forms the league, attempts to blow up 33.1, bart gets captured, clark saves him, and the facility is blown to kingdom com. all is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and suspense. oh, and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character :).the music is probably what makes this episode work so well. if you remember correctly, the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4. this was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact clark sais at the end "we didn't find you, you found us", kind of made people lose faith in the formula. but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode.i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10. first of all, the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion. i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver's bike (rememeber from the arrow episode). clark and impulse should have obviously ran, and aquaman should have swam via another route. but that was soo incredibly cheesy, it nocked off 2 points from the full 10.secondly, another cheesy moment, not as bad as the first, but when green arrow sais "let's go save the world". that made me cringe. all in all, judging by the acting performances, music, direction and production values, the pros do outweigh the cons, and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history, and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6.7 out of 10...

this is a reunion, a team, and a great episode of justice. from hesitation to resolution, clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a superman who, like green arrow, sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; this is also about deciding what's more important in life, a lesson for clark. i do not want the series to end, but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any "rewind" pushes and put a good end here of smallville---and a wonderful beginning of superman.in this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team. nine stars should give it enough credit.

i really enjoyed this episode. seeing the flash, cyborg, green arrow, and aquaman (even though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for. this sounds a bit off topic, but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. this is the thrill i got from watching this episode. i wish they had made this episode a little longer, like a two hour special, because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough. now before i bore you (unless i already have with my rambling) i just want to say, smallville is cool again. it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana. but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole. :( so enjoy this episode. who knows when another good one's going to come out. catch it again this thursday, feb. 22, if you missed the first airing.

show favorites green arrow (introduced this season), aquaman (introduced in season 5), "impulse" (season 4), and cyborg (season 5) all come together, along with clark, to stop one of lex's evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode.through his sophisticated technology, green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on. green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry (aqua), bart allen (impulse) and victor stone (cyborg) to stop lex and destroy these facilities. after recruiting clark to help, the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory.this episode is incredible. full of action, humor, and fabulous dialog, it feels more like a movie. it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season.

i loved this episode. it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world. i also love this episode because kyle gallner (bart allen/impulse) and justin hartley (oliver queen/green arrow) are guest starring in it!!! i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower, that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers. also, i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33.1, i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!

chloe is mysteriously saved from dr. caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with abilities from belle reve to project 33.1, and a fraction of second later clark arrives. he finds that bart allan has returned to smallville and they meet each other in kent farm. when bart is captured by lex during a break-in in a luthorcorp's facility, clark discovers that the green arrow had also hired bart (a.k.a. impulse), arthur curry (aquaman) and victor stone (cyborg) to investigate the project 33.1. clark accepts to join the trio to save bart and invites chloe to participate of their mission."justice" is the best episode so far of this 6th season. in this episode, the justice league begins its saga with the association of five heroes: clark, green arrow, the flash ("impulse"), aquaman and cyborg. the participation of chloe is spectacular, completing the necessary organization to the teamwork. in the end, oliver breaks up with lois based on the importance of fighting against criminals and lex's secret laboratories around the world. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "justiça" ("justice")

though cher and cage are the focal points of this story, gardenia and dukakis are good counterparts for them- this is where loretta and ronny will be in 50 years- still in love. the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john mahoney- it shows a real slice of life. though i saw this long ago- i am glad it finally catapulted cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent. from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments- this is a very entertaining movie.

this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours. wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage (as always) gently row the plot along. there are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best. a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.

either or, i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. i have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it. norman jewison, a fellow canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. i have often wondered at the paucity of cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in "mask". i found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called "cinderella")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. the brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, i loved the ending, everyone brought together like a greek chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.

"moonstruck" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller, norman jewison (in the heat of the night, fiddler on the roof, the hurricane). the film is great on many levels. it shows a good slice of italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy.one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors. nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film, and cher... well, cher always looks a little odd.overall, it's a fun film, and easy to recommend.7.4 out of 10

i found this to be a so-so romance/drama that has a nice ending and a generally nice feel to it. it's not a hallmark hall of fame-type family film with sleeping-before-marriage considered "normal" behavior but considering it stars jane fonda and robert de niro, i would have expected a lot rougher movie, at least language-wise. the most memorable part of the film is the portrayal of how difficult it must be to learn how to read and write when you are already an adult. that's the big theme of the movie and it involves some touching scenes but, to be honest, the film isn't that memorable.it's still a fairly mild, nice tale that i would be happy to recommend.

this is not a bad film. it is not wildly funny, but it is interesting andentertaining. it has a few funny moments. cher gives a goodperformance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. herperformance alone is worth the watch. if this movie had come outtoday it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards itwas excellent.

it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress, but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction. anyway, oscar and golden globe winning, and bafta nominated cher plays loretta castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr. johnny cammareri (danny aiello) to marry him. he promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. only problem is, when she finds johnny's one-handless brother ronny (golden globe nominated nicolas cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). also starring oscar nominated vincent gardenia as cosmo castorini, oscar, bafta and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose castorini and john mahoney as perry. it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta, but she and ronny were happy together. it won the oscar for best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, and it was nominated for best director for norman jewison (in the heat of the night) and best picture, it was nominated the baftas for best score for dick hyman and best original screenplay, and it was nominated the golden globes for best motion picture - comedy/musical and best screenplay. it was number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("snap out of it!"), it was number 17 on 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!

i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier. it invariably supersedes anything else on those "cosmo's moon" nights. cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay. what? you don't know what a "cosmo's moon" is?

i'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb. it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone, but for romantic comedy "moonstruck" is really in a class by itself. it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted. the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie. few movies in the 1980's were as good as "moonstruck"and it's funny too. **** out of *****

"moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. i own that film on dvd! the movie deals with a new york widow (cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (danny aiello) angry brother (nicholas cage) who works at a bakery. i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie. nicholas cage and danny aiello are great, too. the direction from norman jewison (who directed "fiddler on the roof") is fantastic. "moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. a must-see!10/10 stars!

the "movie aimed at adults" is a rare thing these days, but moonstruck does it well, and is still a better than average movie, which is aging very well. although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it, the movie has a wonderful specificity (italians in brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. mobsters never appear in acomplication. it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding) the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. i miss these scenes. it also beautifully involves older characters. the movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. there isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. cage and cher do very nice work.moonstruck invokes old-school, ethnic, workaday new york much like 'marty' except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious.

as someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gem. most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director jewison hit a home run every time. the cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, dick hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. the comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. cher is such a comedy natural, vincent gardenia (who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off-broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast. has jewison ever written about this film?would love to read it. hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low...

seeing "moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared. who knew that cher could act? who had ever heard of olympia dukakis? nicholas cage was the beginning of his career, and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was norman jewison the director.the only really flat note in this splendid work is "when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as loretta castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. aielo (johny cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother. he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, ronny, attends the wedding. loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him. meanwhile, her father (vincent gardenia) is cheating on her mother (olympia dukakis), which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan opera.everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. in the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. in its way, "moonstruck" is how hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. if they'd only lost "that's amore" along the way, it would have been perfect.

"moonstruck" is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it. i really liked it the second time. i loved it the third time. now it is one of my all time favorites.the humor is subtle but really good. the film offers a lot of warmth humor. the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc. cher's search for love is enjoyable to watch. this film is, by far, the best job nicholas cage has done on film. the old man character is fantastic. he lights up the screen without saying a word. the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. but, perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia dukakis.the film's climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. exceptional direction and wrap up.

i don't think that many films (especially comedies) have added memorable, quotable dialog like moonstruck. i won't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me. it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory. how about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client? or a nice, elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon? or perry (john mahoney's) description of a female student's youthful promise as "moonlight in a martini" (my favorite line).moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script, first rate direction, and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly. there are other examples (the drama the ox-bow incident is another example, but a grimmer one). cher, olympia dukakis, vincent gardenia, nicholas cage, john mahoney, and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love, and how to handle it. is it a good thing to be totally in love? cher and cage, at the end, seem to think so, but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy (and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme). is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. dukakis believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) aiello. chance reveals infidelity - dukakis realizes early that gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera (but gardenia also stumbles onto cher's similar unfaithfulness to aiello). but chance also causes misunderstandings: fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair.there are lovely little moments in the film too. cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving one. her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it's resolution. but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher's uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita's charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him. it is the sweetest moment of the entire film.it is close to a flawless film. after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be. when cher is at cage's bakery, his assistant chrissy (nada despotovich) mentions how she is secretly in love with cage, but has been afraid to tell him. earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher, who put her in her place quickly. yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry. at the same time, the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped. was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped, besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at a homeless man's shelter as penance? it is a small annoyance, but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good.

the bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! these characteristics of idealistic imagery which "moonstruck" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in hollywood. let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are "yesteryear". "moonstruck" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old italian neighborhood in new york city. new york city has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical new yorkers, this includes a lot of italian americans living in new york as well! the mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in american history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. these generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! for this italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! the kindred spirits with everyone in "moonstruck" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. one might wonder about cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. in "moonstruck", however, i think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. all of the characters in "moonstruck" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. the most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! i thought the acting in this movie was sensational. all relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! for this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). the fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. thus signifying everything!! the homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; be honest, get angry; be honest, get confrontational; be honest, get distorted and emphatic; most importantly; be honest, and fall in love!! this is cher's best performance ever as an actress!! nicholas cage, danny aiello, and olympia dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in "moonstruck" such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! director, norman jewison (famous for "cincinnati kid", "thomas crowne affair", and most famous for "in the heat of the night" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! i am italian american in descent, (partially anyways) cher is not italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! i guess since non-italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! it is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! for those of you who didn't like this movie, i just have one thing to say "snap out of it!!" this movie "moonstruck" is totally happy go lucky!! totally eighties!! and totally five stars!! see it!!

this film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. it is virtually flawless! the writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! even the music -- from dean martin to la boheme -- is captivating and delightful!every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by cher and nicolas cage, to the many supporting roles -- olympia dukakis , vincent gardenia, john mahoney, danny aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! each of these performers, plus norman jewison as director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. for several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.i've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. more tellingly, i realized some years ago that whenever i channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. there are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the cher and nicolas cage characters, where cage tells his tale of woe; vincent gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; olympia dukakis scolding john mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: "don't sh-t where you eat!"; danny aiello at his dying mother's bedside; nicolas cage "taking" cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! there are of course many great romantic comedies, among them sabrina (both versions, but especially the audrey hepburn/humphrey bogart/william holden original); when harry met sally; the apartment.none quite equals moonstruck!

this movie is still an all time favorite. only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film. this movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! i think this is cher's best work ever and her most believable performance. cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure. whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like cher? cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. she is one of the most unique artists out there. it's funny, because who would have thought of cher as such a naturally gifted actress? she is heads above the so-called movie "stars" of today. cher is a real actor on the same level as debra winger, alfre woodard, holly hunter, angela bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be "acting," she really becomes the character convincingly. she has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public.everything about moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food. i never get tired of watching this movie.every time single time i watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at rose's house, i pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food rose is serving. i saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (i think), but i can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? what is that main course? it looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another. the grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. he seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too.loretta's mom wasn't "just a housewife," she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. she was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was. high powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as rose casterini was. notice the saucy way she said "i didn't have kids until after i was 37. it ain't over 'til its over." you got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. she was charming, quick witted, and very smart. what a great mom! i didn't actually like loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. she could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life. she was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. she was more conventional than her own mom. she dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. she would probably end up making an awesome mom too.i could see in the future, a house full of loretta and ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and rose and cosmo enjoying every minute of it.

there is nothing not to like about moonstruck. i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it. the actors & actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor.. they were all fantastic. it starts a little slow, but a lot happens in that two days! i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie. on my list of favorite movies, moonstruck is number 3. it's a "feel good" movie where you leave the theatre humming "that's amore" or repeating some of your favorite lines: "old man, if you give those dogs another piece of my food, i'll kick you till you're dead"; "chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "do you love him loretta....., good because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can". i always put moonstruck on when there's nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.

wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow (cher) who's planning to marry a man she's comfortable with (danny aiello) until she falls for his headstrong, angry brother (nicholas cage). the script is sharp with plenty of great lines, the acting is wonderful, the accents (i've been told) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful. new york has never looked so good on the screen. a must-see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis--they're both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got. a beautiful, funny film. a must see!

deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing, a feat that is beautiful to behold. when cher's spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody younger brother, no one could dream the consequences which follow. operatic symbolism, catholic church confessions, love bites and falling snow..."moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. it takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from ****

'moonstruck' is a love story. there is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. loretta's family. loretta (cher) is about to marry johnny cammareri (danny aiello). she doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny's brother ronny (nicolas cage). he and johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. of course they fall instantly for each other.how this story and love stories of loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. every seen is a delight to watch, with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. she won and really deserved the oscar that year. cage is pretty good, and goofy as well, and olympia dukakis as loretta's mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific. this movie is funny, charming and therefore highly enjoyable.

this movie is brilliant in every way. it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. the script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless johnny. it also and benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting, and performances. the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike "cher" than she has ever been is a wonder to me. i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well. it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.

loretta castorini (cher)is a woman in her late thirties, a widow, who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in brooklyn. she is engaged to marry johnny cammareri (danny aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love. before their wedding johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding. ronny (nicholas cage) hasn't forgiven johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for loretta, and hard. after a heated affair loretta out of respect for johnny tries to avoid ronny, but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over. meanwhile, loretta's mother rose castorini (olympia dukakis) is not only suspecting her husband cosmo (vincent gardenia) is seeing another woman, but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women. things get complicated when johnny returns from sicily to tell loretta they can't be married.the setup is pure sitcom, but the story, written by john patrick shanley with a deep understanding for italian-americans living in new york, is genuine: he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks, and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story. loretta, a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim, slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of la boheme -- the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand (in a clever gender reversal), and cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep, dark beauty. ronny is pure fire and nicholas cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling marlon brando. the castorini's and the cappomaggi's, counterbalancing the central couple, both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments: the latter couple, on the night of the full moon when loretta and ronny consummate their affair -- a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly --, and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when rose bluntly reveals, in touching words, that she wants cosmo to stop seeing his mistress mona (anita gillette).moonstruck is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice, but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people. the ending is a tour de force of emotional impact, the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants, and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic. moonstruck deservedly got its oscars for best writing, actress, and supporting actress, and has proved to grow beyond its time.

so wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so italian. the film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. a kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? take your pick -- they're both faultless. let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass.

one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear! rather risqué for 1931!

soap opera about a small town married woman (kay francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on broadway. when a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. next thing you know she's joined a traveling burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!this film has a pretty interesting plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by kay francis - she just makes this film. also helping here is the well-done acting by minna gombell in her role as a "getting close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends kay. worth seeing, especially for kay francis fans.

this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more. crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. they have never worked before and the brother, william bakewell, gets a job with gable, who is a gangster and bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. their is a massacre in which several of gable's men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing. it's a good movie but not one of their best.

"dance, fools, dance" is an early crawford-gable vehicle from 1931. crawford plays a bonnie jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, booze, and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming. this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (william blakewell) penniless. bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. the head man is jake luva - portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook. later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early '30s, mgm used him as a bad guy. not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity, bonnie cozies up to luva.gable and crawford made a great team. her facial expressions are a little on the wild side, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. look for cliff edwards, the voice of jiminy cricket, as bert.it's always interesting to see the precode movies, and "dance, fools, dance" is no exception.

this is one of joan crawford's best talkies. it was the first gable-crawford pairing, and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars.the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. life is hard in the depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity. joan crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. she's smart, complex, and believable. she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style. clark gable is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford's character. the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in "a free soul", securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm.if you like crawford in this type of role, don't miss "paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early talkie performances.

joan crawford had just begun her "working girl makes good" phase with the dynamic "paid" (1930). she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed. so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering (because they were clinging to characters that had been the "in" thing a few years before but were now becoming passe) joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress. the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon. of course, if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright.this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party. bonnie jordan (joan crawford) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear!!! however, when bonnie's father has a heart attack, because of loses on the stock market, both bonnie and her brother, rodney (william bakewell) realise who their real friends are. after bob townsend (lester vail - a poor man's johnny mack brown) offers to do the "right thing" and marry her - they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared (with abandon) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job.she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well. her working buddy is bert scranton (cliff edwards) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob. rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job. she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer, jake luva (clark gable). rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces, "spilling the beans" to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be bert. he is then forced to kill bert and after- wards he goes into hiding. the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake's clubs. (joan does a very lively dance to "accordian joe" - much to sylvie's disgust). the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying, bonnie tearfully phones in her story.this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all. natalie moorehead, who as sylvie shared a famous "cigarette scene" with gable early in the film, was a stylish "other woman" who had her vogue in the early thirties. william bakewell had a huge career (he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s). a lot of his roles though were weak, spineless characters. in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable - maybe that was why he never became a star.highly recommended.

this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations. there are constant references to assembly line production, where workers are treated as cogs in a machine, overseen by managers wielding clipboards, controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed, and firing workers (stanley) who meet all criteria (as his supervisor says, are always on time, are hard workers, do good work) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake. this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home (where he quickly dies) after stanley loses his job. iris' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant. references are made to the fact that now, with declining wages, both partners need to work, the implication being that there's nobody left at home to care for the kids. iris' husband is dead from an illness, and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care, the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care. iris' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job (even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them). the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail (presumably, he's also black, and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates). she remarks that he, like her, "is doing time" - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave.stanley, however, still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism. he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as iris' brother in law does (suggesting that he "married the wrong sister"). he does not, as iris says, conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else; rather, he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way, in a sort of bauhaus ideal. this was the dream of early modernists and 1920's socialists (such as the bauhaus) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs, allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations. he is also outside of traditional gender relations. he cooks, he cleans, he cares for his family, and he knows how to iron. iris, on the other hand, lives in a traditionally male role - she's a factory worker, the mains source of income for her (extended) family, and she brings stanley into the public realm, traditionally off-limits to women. by teaching him to read and write, she gives him access to the world of knowledge, also traditionally gendered male.literacy here is used as a metaphor for the (traditionally masculine) public realm and the systems of circulation (monetary, vehicular, cultural) that enable participation in the public realm. without this access, stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning. he is excluded from all regular circulations, unable to participate in the monetary (can't open a bank account), in the vehicular (can't get a driver's license, can't ride the bus), and in the social (he asks if he exists if he can't write his name).after learning to read, he grabs books on auto repair, farming, and spirituality (the bible). the word of god is therefore relativized, placed on the same value plane as how-to books. in fact, organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex. it is, however, acknowledged as a moral force - iris, clearly a character devoted to living a "good" life, mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching.once able to read, he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan, a car, and a house, taking his place at the head of the family, the breadwinner. presumably, he's an industrial designer, dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce. this ending, probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film, is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it wasn't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line.now that, according to the pundits, we've comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism, the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel, as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period. nevertheless, it's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain. disregard the ending, and it's close to a perfect 10.

don't listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! young rich joan and her brother find themselves penniless after their father dies - and now they have to work for a living! she, naturally, becomes a reporter, and he, just as naturally, a driver for the mob! by wild co-incidences their careers meet head on, thanks to gangster clark gable. in the meantime there is the chance for a moonlight underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of risque dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam-shovel).but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously - it's all good fun from those wonderful pre-code days, when hollywood was really naughty. joan looks great, and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such longevity (thank god she stopped the dancing!). gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero. great to see him playing something different. and william bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry beaumont, who moves the piece on with a cracking pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! great fun!

i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. set right after the carefree, roaring 20s, during the early days of the great depression, dance, fools, dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale, with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. yet this fast-paced and tightly-plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.in the 30s, hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining *and* enlightening audience-pleaser after another, all without wasting a frame of film. dance, fools, dance -- one of *four* films that harry beaumont directed in 1931 -- is barely 80 minutes long, yet its characters are well developed, its story never seems rushed, and despite its many twists in plot, the audience is never left behind.with the lone exception of lester vail as flaccid love interest bob townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. worthy of note are william bakewell as crawford's brother, cliff edwards (best known as the voice of jiminy cricket) as reporter bert scranton, and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake luva.but this is joan crawford's film, and she absolutely shines in it. made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. however, here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce, crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.score: eight out of ten

this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel doordarshan which was aired at least 15 years ago. the series was known as "gubbarre" meaning balloons. each episode was a new short story. the story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and "convincing" abhay doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a "normal" and "third class" guys(as he calls himself in the movie). in fact shayan munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the abhays role but shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off.i would suggest watching the series if it is available. it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction. the acting of the tv actors was much better than these "stars".the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour(or 45 minutes) story to 2+ hours. so it has to get draggy. even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up.this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial. the script and the ending of the serial was much better#####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### #####spoilers ahead######### the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him. he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be "repayed" and never helped with that intention. the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film. the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement. the deliver just wasn't right.but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy. no credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter. the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of premchand munshi. i am not sure if this is premchand munshi's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi's and other great hindi writers stories.

abhay deol's second film, written by imtiaz ali, maiden directorial effort by shivam nair. soha probably has her first (?) meaty role as megha, a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the delhi marriage registrar's office for her boyfriend dheeraj (shayan munshi) to meet her. she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by ankush (abhay deol). they spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her. then the boyfriend returns! aage pardey par dekhiye! sound familiar? this is yet another adaptation of dostoyevsky's white nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from le notti bianchi (very tiny though - ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead!). but this is an earthier and more realistic (duh) adaptation than the much hyped and overblown saawariya. i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing saawariya like crazy a few months ago.the delhi settings are wonderful - there is the obligatory run through old delhi, shots of jama masjid from a roof top, connaught circus, streets with rickshaws (what? how?). the colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour! the more i see of abhay the more i like this young man. in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman. soha looks beautiful, and when she smiles she fits the role, but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments. i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress, or maybe she will blossom late like the brother. the music by himesh reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs, they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them. the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up. btw - the fact that i love abhay deol's cute dimples has nothing to do with my rating.

this movie was disaster at box office, and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie, sweetness of the story. music was good, story is very simple and old, but presentation of such story is very good, director tried his best. abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. soha looks so sweet in the movie. rest star cast was simply okay. music and all songs are good, himesh is impressive as an singer here. don't miss this movie, its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us. abhay best work till date. i will give 9/10 to ahista ahista.

this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time. soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful. soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore. abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future.the ending of the movie is very different from most movies. in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms, you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie. otherwise, it would have been gross injustice to everyone. the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court. her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness. slowly slowly, over the time, he falls in love for her. it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not. watch the movie for complete details. the movie really belongs to abhay. i look forward to seeing more movies from him. soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie. her eyes, her innocence did most of the talking.

watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind.movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage. soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't, leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her, this is the base of story.the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat.dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right.a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10

ahista ahista is one little small brilliant. i started watching it, and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new. but as the film went on, i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film, the fantastic writing and the charming romance. the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guy's life. there's one very good reason the film got this feel, and it's the fresh talent called abhay deol. he is extremely convincing as the simple, kind-hearted and struggling ankush, whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life. throughout the film, he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster, but also as a helping and loving person, who, like anyone else will do anything to protect his love. deol portrays all the different shades of his character, whether positive or negative, naturally and with complete ease.shivam nair's direction is very good. his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent, but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankush's relationships with the different people who surround him, including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for. i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friend's loud and plump mother whom he calls 'khala' (aunty). he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion, yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother-figure to him as evidenced in several scenes. except for abhay, the rest of the cast performed well. though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me, she was good and had some of her mother's charm. the actors who played ankush's friends were very good as was the actress who played ankush's 'khala'.apart from the performances, the film's writing was outstanding. the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant, and the script was also fantastic. that's mainly because despite a not-so-new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger-than-life. the film's biggest weakness was himesh reshammiya's uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film. otherwise, ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene. the concept may not be new, but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by. the ending was bittersweet, kind of sad yet optimistic. in short, this movie really grows on you slowly, and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing, the moving moments, the charming romance, the realistic proceedings, and of course abhay deol's memorable performance.

abhay deol meets the attractive soha ali khan and greets her "hello sister"!!!. this sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by shivam nair. soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in nainital and come to delhi to marry her lover, shayan munshi. but shyan doesn't turn up leaving soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. slowly romance blooms and soha agrees to marry abhay. then shyan re-enters into soha's life.a sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in delhi, revolves around the delicate soha. this well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & abhay's swift apology; abhay describing soha as "class wali ladki" & hastily adding "that he doesn't love her"; his gifting a churidar to soha & asking her out for a date.the music is good & the background music excellent. in a scene where soha rushes & embraces abhay the sound track disappears. the stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.the poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.a must see i will rate it 8.5/10

the story is about ankush (abhay deol) - who is professional marriage witness, in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office - and megha (soha ali khan) who ran away from her home at nainital to get married to her love interest dhiraj (shayan munshi). the story starts with megha waiting at the marriage registration office for dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up. so ankush comes in the picture here, who had approached megha with the intention of earning rs. 200 for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her. ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent&#8230; ankush falls in love with megha and she too falls in love with him (or kind of love), both agree for the marriage and dhiraj comes back in the picture. unexpected circumstances happen, actually i should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then&#8230;.actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different, then you will definitely like the movie. the movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of abhay deol and soha ali khan. the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door. the background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. the way delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.so let's cut it out and sum it up.story: a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience.music: well, as it was himesh reshammiya creation, so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the qawwali.acting: abhay deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs. soha ali khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll i must say. again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters. apart from these two, shayan munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones. other actors did their job well.stars: i would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre, i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories. otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive. the movie will definitely won't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity.

look, this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world. to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself. i remember that the early 80's were a time of uncertainty. the economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. out of that confusion came a hero, stroker ace. ned beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness. his triumph is an inspiration to all. the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer. jim nabors is a poet. go see this movie tonight!

i love old burt reynolds movies. they're funnier and better than every other movie combined. they might as well have stopped making movies after "cannonball run 2", but i guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? man this movie's good. burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. burt and loni, those were the days! i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. i sure loved that advertisement! plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace (burty r.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night! if you can find this movie, rent it! and then never watch another movie again, because i tell you right now: there's no point.

this is a hilarious film. burt reynolds is a nascar star who signs a sponsorship contract with ned beatty's chicken pit restaurants. the contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing burt to wear a chicken suit during the race! jim nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief mechanic. loni anderson (oh, yeah!) is assigned by beatty to keep reynolds honest and strictly adhering to the contract. this is a funny film in which burt proves that he ain't too proud. i like it!

from the view of a nascar maniac like i am, the movie is interesting. you can see many race cars from 1983. even tough, the racing scenes are not that much realistic. but i have to admit, that i haven't seen any race before 1995, because before that time, they didn't show any nascar races in germany)from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am, the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the 80's: burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in his bandit movies.if you love nascar and burt reynolds, this movie is a must-see. if you only love one of this 2 things, i also recommend to watch it. if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds, you still should give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award.it is the typical humor of the 80's. if you like movies like the cannonball movies, and police academy, you will also like that one.

this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year. i didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. it is similar to anchorman in the humor department, but i think this is a better put together movie. it actually has a point. if you are going to see a whole bunch of t&a you will be disappointed. just a well put together movie!!!! if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. i definitely think that ebert and roeper's review of this movie is right on. i mean, i don't really like ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that i will agree about. the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.

from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie. the poster is possibly the funniest i've ever seen for a movie. i immediately bought one for my dorm this september.every element came together in this movie so beautifully. it's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. the supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves.one of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given. this is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. this movie will often be brought up when the words "chest waxing" and "condoms" are mentioned in conversation.watching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it. i saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter.i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell. a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on family guy, too. the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women.i don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. however, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. the jokes aren't "gay jokes," they're just jokes. and they're funny.

steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful, original, raunchy breath of fresh air. i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was.basically the movie's title says it all: andy stitzer is a 40 year- old male who works at an electronics store. he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics, and has the biggest collection. his peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game, and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky in the very end.leave the little ones at home, but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy. it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments. only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. he is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards. you can bet your hard earned dollar on that, people!i give this one a perfect 10!

well let me just say something about these actors, they really were a good decision, and from experience, having actors really brings the dialogue to life. if you walk into this even fifteen minutes late, you'll be in for a shock, the movie will have already began. you don't want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you came to not miss any jokes.wow! i have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. not to be harsh, i mean i loved it, but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped! but i'm getting ahead of myself, lets start with the very start of it, when it began. the plot outline goes like this, there is this man, and not to give away any spoilers, (*spoiler alert!!*) (he hasn't had any sex ever(!) they use this plot device to set the story moving, and there are (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters, some containing irony, and jokes, and awkward situations, you know.the director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog, some music, and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between. i went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what i already knew about it, and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy. ten stars!!!

the 40 year old virgin, is about andy stitzer, a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women. some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that andy, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. one day in the store andy, meets a woman named trish, who gives him her phone number and eventually andy, works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but andy, is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to trish, much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward. the 40 year old virgin, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. the film stars and is co-written by steve carell, who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too. i was very pleasantly surprised with this film. it is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time. this film is just as good as this year's wedding crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies i have seen in awhile. the 40 year old virgin, really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun. one of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.

spoilers sex huh? it's one of the most basic parts of human life. yet, do we ever take it too seriously? people always want more, even those who get it on a daily basis, and if you are unlucky, there are potential life changing (creating) consequences. ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age (despite victorians getting married and having children in their early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins. in steve carell's first big screen lead, he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it. treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents, not to mention more profanity than an episode of "eurotrash", the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny. it's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate, failed jokes, there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics.andy stitzer (carell) is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. at the same time though, he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, andy's friends discover his secret. at the age of 40, andy is still a virgin. now, for multiple reasons, but mostly pity, the three men (paul rudd, seth rogen and romany malco) all offer andy advice with one goal in mind. to put him out of his misery and get him laid.one of the few good things about "anchorman", it was only going to be a matter of time before steve carell got himself a lead of his own. impressively, in "the 40 year old virgin" he doesn't disappoint. showing the hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help.carell is not alone however in his performance. rudd, rogen, malco and catherine keener as the love interest are all superb. rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick david who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with rogen as the two argue over homosexuality.the biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark, but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it's head. obviously designed for conservative america, the film's entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence. the virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete, he just needs confidence and true love. a worthy message to preach, and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film.it's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted, but low and behold, "40 year old virgin" is just that. throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy. a surprising joy.

as we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect; i did see the commercials after all; "is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?" what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. there's still the weird "off-the-wall" characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.the main character andy is (unfortunately for me) a person i can relate to. in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. most importantly of all; andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. it's like my life story.the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does. i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and i assure you it does. these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults.when i say "good" i mean "bad" of course. this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. for the most part i think it succeeded. there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish. or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence "ooh! como se llama!" an interesting little note about that scene; the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.actually since we're talking about steve carell, i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. i was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that.to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see. i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance. now excuse me while i go puke my guts out; i can't believe i just wrote that...my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin

this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark, and continues it throughout the movie. i cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me. he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed.the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular. as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7.9 on imdb. i think it should be in 250. lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation. see it if you want a laugh. i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb, great movie site.

this movie is a riot. i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies. i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. but this one is wall to wall great lines. i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in. the movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. you have to see it two or three times to get it all in.as far as the actual film goes, it could have used a better edit, it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. all the characters are great. it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. no victims in this movie. also, thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. you just wish that women like her really existed. she's not a "10" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite.if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. i assure you, the trailer does not do it justice. they do not give away all the good jokes. just some of the mediocre ones.oh and one more thing. i hope critics put this on their top ten list. many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. this means you ebert!!!

''the 40 year old virgin'''made me laugh a lot. i don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.andy stitzer has a peaceful life. he is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys, but seems harmless. one day, while playing poker with his friends of his work, they discover that andy is in fact...virgin! and he is already 40 years old! after this surprising revelation, all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman...the problem is the confusions in which andy gets in,specially now that he is really starting to like trish, a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at.

the key to the 40-year-old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one. in a genre of crass "comedy" that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters, the 40-year-old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes. that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity.carell, a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex-daily show castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why andy is the way he is. it's the little things that make this film work. when andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, andy describes his failed efforts at cooking. when andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turns. he doesn't just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them, and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. a lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things.the plot is fairly simplistic  andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman. it's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility.andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: david (paul rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her, jay (romany malco) is a womanizing ladies' man and cal (seth rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times, and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic.finally andy meets single mom trish (played by catherine keener) and, much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it, he falls in love with her. they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  trish being unaware that andy is still a virgin.the 40-year-old virgin was directed by judd apatow, the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy, and began the short-lived cult tv show freaks and geeks. apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor, and the script  co-written by carell  offers plenty.however, in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of the 40-year-old virgin is its maturity. by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics, and even i was surprised by its warm reception. but after seeing the film, it's easy to understand why. we like andy. we care about him. he's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché  he's a real, living, breathing person. his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety. his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. it strikes a chord with the audience.although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor, it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen. the best sex comedies work this way  from risky business to american pie  and that is the major difference between something like the 40-year-old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.

i was really surprised with this movie. going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i'd seen, i thought it was going to be a dude where's my car kind of crap fest. i was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. instead i got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boys. all the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.i went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and i was very surprised. yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.in the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if ashton kutcher found his car or not?

i'm not quite sure if the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, im not even sure if this can be applied. on the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. therefore, i considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as "serious comedies".does the 40 year old virgin fit into this guild? that is finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. you get to laugh a lot, plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations.i'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there, and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men.the story, as the title says it, is about andy, a shy, silent guy, whom collects action figures, watches survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is asia.kal is andy's co-worker at smarttech. he believes andy to be a psychopath until andy's secret is revealed. kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.david is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, whom ran away with another guy. and jay, a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.i'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film, but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. so in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films.it also includes dvd bonuses which you'll really see from top to bottom.

the 40 year-old virgin (2005) **** steve carell, catherine keener, paul rudd, romany malco, seth rogen, elizabeth banks, leslie mann, jane lynch, gerry bednob, shelley malil, kat dennings. hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular andy stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the a-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in southern california who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (rudd, malco & rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. what follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within andy. a surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since "there's something about mary" with a shrewdly observant script by director judd apatow and carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate david caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. a true winner and an instant classic; the funniest film of the year.

only once in a while do we get an r-rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. it's an even rarer case when the critics will like it. i just came back from the 40 year-old virgin and i can honestly say, it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. i went to a 10:35 showing and every row was filled. not only that, everyone laughed their ass off the whole time through. it's two hours of non-stop laughing. i dare you to see this film and to not laugh.the plot is simple. a man is forty years old and he is a virgin. yet, behind this simple, five second joke, we are given a deep, complex story that is not only one of the funniest you'll ever witness, but has genuine lessons behind it. steve carell stars as andy stitzer, the 40 year-old virgin. we have known steve carell, as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. stealing hilarious scenes from bruce almighty and especially anchorman, steve carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star. no one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny, gut-busting, roll-in-the-aisle hilarious comedy.the beauty about the film is it isn't 100% stupid. the brilliant writing of judd apatow and steve carell genuinely has purpose and it's not just one hell of a story to tell. behind the crudeness and vulgar non-stop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned. although not presented in the best way possible, the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable time. its gut-busting attitude will have you laughing the whole time through, while we simultaneously see the real life struggles of people like andy and his fellow co-workers. the end couldn't have been better. not only does it deliver what we are promised but it gives one of the most memorable finishing numbers a comedy has ever seen. it would have been perfect if there was vince vaughn and owen wilson in there cameoing somehow, but you can't win 'em all, now can you.finally, i think as roger ebert put it, catherine keener gives an unexplainable perfect performance as trish, the one woman andy has his heart truly for. not only does she also give us laughs but it is crazy to see how brightly she fuels the story. she was cast perfected in the role and her and carell have terrific, not to mention, hilarious chemistry on screen.canadian ratings-wise, once again, ontario slips away with a 14a, while british columbia, alberta, and manitoba all slapped the 40 year-old virgin with an 18a. the same thing happened with four brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and i can honestly say that i love ontario more and more so for that. to all you fellow teenagers out there in the states: good luck sneaking in! overall, steve carell gives one of the funniest performances i've ever seen and just about everyone in the cast distributes to the non-stop laughter. everyone will love the 40 year-old virgin this summer and i encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible. it is the best comedy of the year, hands down. it beats all over the longest yard, the wedding crashers, and of course apatow and carell's last memorable comedy, anchorman.it is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it. every single one of my favourite critics loved it and it deserves a spot on the imdb top 250 right away. steve carell is a huge star. watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right now.my rating: 9/10 objectively  9/10 subjectively  10/10 eliason a.

all right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. there are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but i probably blushed about as much as i laughed. actually, i probably blushed more than i laughed. and if i wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then i was blushing on the inside. if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder i suppose.i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. if i were to say, "this movie is hilarious, go check it out!" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something i don't need on my conscience.so how raunchy is it? hmm, try about 100 times worse than the wedding crashers. honestly. my mom would've walked out during the first scene. i feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what i come to expect from the man (judd apatow) who had a hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared. i'm all for making fun of michael mcdonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money. paul rudd proclaiming, "if i hear ya mo be there one more time i'll ya mo burn this place down," is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.and when we see a quick 3-second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo's word up, i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. the movie doesn't portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. he's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. sure, he's a little weird. after all, he has a framed asia poster, "more videogames than an asian kid," and a toy collection that features the million dollar man's boss, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. as odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an "it's ok to wait" message.but man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go. that was certainly apatow's intention. according to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly rogen and malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. if you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.i'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. i find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. but that's me. like i said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. i just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. honestly ladies, you might not want to know. if you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.there you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. be that your guide. it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. if you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.

this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. catherine keener was terrific as trish, and all of steve carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.

steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin, having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched, bruce almighty, anchorman, and his work on the daily show, we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own. you can tell that will ferrell influenced his "comedic air" but carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs (or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did), a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. the music fit the tone of the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing.filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers, anchorman, or any movie along those lines, you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin.

something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, wedding crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. but by the end of the 40 year old virgin, i think i found overall it was more satisfying than 'crashers'. although one can guess where the relationship story with steve carrell's character andy and catherine keener's character trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. and, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve carrell as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn, as carrell has built up his cult status on the daily show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in anchorman and bruce almighty. this is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. he and co-writer/director judd apatow treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. it's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). as the title suggests, andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little pee-wee herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).so, his friends (among them paul rudd, romany mancoy, seth rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. he almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (jane lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with trish, who works across the street from him. as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of "how is he going to tell her such and such" might get in the way of the comedy. it doesn't. in fact, if anything, carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. for practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment i wasn't laughing, whether big or small.the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, rudd's being the funniest). the big laughs come through because of carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, carrell gets very high points here. and like with a farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). but if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. this is one of the funniest films of the year.

i got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. the premise seemed silly and i assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. what a great surprise. i laughed so hard i cried at some of the jokes. this film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. ok.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (jack palance?) or small children. the language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. what's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story. my girlfriend and i both loved it. steve carell is terrific, but (like the office) the supporting cast really makes the film work. all of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. i can't wait to get the dvd. i'm sure it will be up there with office space for replays and quotable lines.

steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'the daily show', and then in various supporting roles. in virgin, carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. carell plays andy stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. one night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. his co-workers, david (paul rudd), jay (romany malco), and cal (seth rogen) initially tease andy about his situation. but it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. and so begins andy's quest into adulthood. andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. in addition, i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. i'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. still, every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. a good comparison would be 'the wedding crashers' from earlier this summer. virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. i particularly loved the ending of the film, which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick. without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'something about mary'. very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. i would highly recommend.

i haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. i got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because i had been dying to see it. i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. the audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.kudos to steve carrell(who i had already been a fan of). he proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. he has a style that i haven't seen before. and catherine keener is excellent as always. thank god there wasn't a cameo from will ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).there were parts of comedic genius in this movie. partly thanks to carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also carrell). the waxing scene and the speed dater with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical.i will definitely go see '40 year old virgin' when it's released. my advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it.

just came out of a sneak preview for this film. it had me laughing every 30 secs. the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke. there are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in "bruce almighty" and will ferrell "anchorman: the legend of ron burgendy" in their movies. paul rudd is hilarious as always. i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like p.s.). i think that seth rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments. i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. however, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. if you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. and, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. it would make for some incredibly awkward moments.

in the previews, "the 40 year-old virgin" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't. too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. and then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. what's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called "the 40 year-old virgin."the virgin of the title is andy stitzer (steve carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. he has a lovely home theater system and watches "survivor" with his two kind elderly neighbors. he's a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.now here's the real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way, meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game ("mortal kombat: deception," no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).as someone who is rapidly approaching 20, collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed, i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been. i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. a bit arrogant, i know, but would you ("you" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of "the 40 year-old virgin"?of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with "morning rise" (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. when it's first discovered andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david (paul rudd), jay (romany malco) and cal (seth rogen) all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman, which couldn't be any further from the truth. the truth is, andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.david, jay, and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid, so help them all. but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with nicky (leslie mann), who puts andy through the worst drunk-driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth (elizabeth banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.things brighten up for andy when he meets trish (catherine keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people. hmmm. and with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever "do the deed."at last, this is the sex romp we've been waiting for. it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through, not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture: how many of us "lonely guys" want to be a lonely guy forever? the important thing we're taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself. i don't think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does (which is side-splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was the blood on carell's shirt afterward)."the 40 year-old virgin" was directed by judd apatow and co-written by himself and carell, which originated as a skit that starred carell. carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i've ever seen and is not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. even carell's buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.the way "the 40 year-old virgin" plays out is indeed funny in the end, but i'll leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. surely, if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener, then it's true: it is never too late!10/10

i have watched this movie three times. the last time, i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot. perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically. or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because ann's recall of distant events is rather faulty.take the young ann grant (claire danes). here is a young woman who has attended an unnamed college with the scions of a rich family. she must have had help to afford this very expensive education, but never seems to have any family ties at all. she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect.ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris arden (patrick wilson). then, when harris comforts lila after the tragic death of her brother buddy, ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior. i must have missed something significant here. ann's behavior seems totally inexplicable. ann abandons her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at lila's wedding. despite ann's rejection of harris, she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her deathbed.it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her. a scene showing their chance meeting years after lila's wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann.the film showed a pattern for ann's romantic relationships. she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them. this pattern held with harris and two husbands. in contrast, lila married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died. perhaps lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail.then came the too convenient reappearance of lila ross at ann's bedside. apparently ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from ann's last few lucid moments to identify and contact lila. none of this communication appeared on the film.i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days. how did she afford to buy such a house on the meager earnings of her singing career? ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters.on another level, i enjoyed the film's setting and music immensely. the seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful. claire danes was luminous as the young ann grant. she is really quite a talented singer. i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras. if only those pesky cgi fireflies would go away, i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote!

criticism of the film evening, based on the novel by susan minot and adapted for the screen by minot and michael cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc. for this viewer, seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.ann grant lord (vanessa redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'harris' - with her two grown daughters nina (toni colette) and constance (natasha richardson). as her daughters sit at her bedside ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend lila (mamie gummer) - a marriage both ann (claire danes as the youthful ann) and lila's alcoholic brother buddy (hugh dancy) objected to, feeling that lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - harris arden (patrick wilson), her housekeeper's son who had become a physician. harris, buddy, lila, and ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as ann is dying. the older lila (meryl streep) visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.' the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by minot and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons. yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words, such 'holes' are understandable. the film is graced by the presence of not only redgrave, richardson (redgrave's true daughter), collette, gummer (streep's true daughter), meryl streep, claire danes, eileen atkins, glenn close, hugh dancy and patrick wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances. the setting is gorgeous (cinematography by gyula pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable jan a.p. kaczmarek. lajos koltai ("being julia') directs. judge this film on your own.... grady harp

evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth. all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances. with the tremendous cast, though, one expects stellar acting, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family. as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind. this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it. the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack. any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles. needless to say now, but i recommend evening highly. see it you will enjoy it.

if you cannot enjoy a chick flick, stop right now. if, however, you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting, read on.ann grant lord is dying. her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside. ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware, and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined. they come to realize that these people from their mother's past are, indeed, real.the story shifts, basically, between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at ann's life between those years. it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy.one of ann's two best friends from college, lila, is being married. ann's other best friend is lila's brother, buddy. lila and buddy are the children of a rich newport family, whereas ann is a cabaret singer living in greenwich village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950's conventions.soon after ann arrives to be maid of honor at lila's wedding, she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three - harris. he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town. ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be. buddy, also, is in love with harris, but being 1953, he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend, ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man. buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic, wise-cracking bad boy of the family - much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents.needless to say, all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy - after all this is a chick flick.in the present time, ann's daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts. constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife. nina, having always felt inferior, cannot maintain a relationship.stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years, and you get an intriguing look at society, its values, and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved.all of the acting in evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film so very, very special.claire danes plays the 1950's ann, and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do. her performance is not easily forgettable.vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present, to the past, to flights of fantasy, and of course, redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style.natasha richardson - redgrave's real daughter - plays ann's daughter, constance, in the film. the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch.toni collette plays ann's other daughter, nina. nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister. collette is perfect for a part such as this, but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays.mamie gummer plays 1950's lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend, ann. she is very good.meryl streep - gummer's mother - plays present day lila. what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance.director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film. he certainly was right, and close's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind. all the other scenes in which close is lila's very proper mother, and you get another performance to treasure.there are three other scenes in the film, combined with the one featuring close described above, that make the whole movie worth watching. on lila's wedding day, ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lila's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love. this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived. in this latter scene, streep and redgrave are enthralling.the other memorable scene - at least to me - is when buddy declares his love for ann. hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. his performance is superior.chick flick? yes. a very special film with unbelievable acting, directing, and scenery? definitely. i cannot recommend evening too much.

so many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so i duly responded. here are some remarks..vanessa redgrave is great even while lying in bed. she also looks very old and i don't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers. i think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years. claire danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth. mamie gummer's resemblance to her mother merly streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that i lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance. she is surprisingly good; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor. i agree with a previous comment: natasha richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face. she certainly does not look like how i remember her from previous films ("nell" for example.) both she and toni collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters. their interplay is weak. toni collette additionally is way too old for her character. glenn close and meryl streep had to have more screen time. streep's performance actually is little more than a cameo. her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film. eileen atkins provides some welcome dry wit, especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to redgrave's character. as for the men; hugh dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed. as a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag. it is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer. patrick wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film. he also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people (one of them a man) are so much smitten by this man. the backstory to this should have been developed more.the cinematography is excellent as expected. however the main summer house set failed to convince me. it does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill, particularly with its grass patch in the front. a bit too cardboard like.overall, the film is a classy production, but a seen-it-all-before, cried-at-it-all-before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that i expected from a tearjerker. however, it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time, about one's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not. worth trying at least on dvd if not at the movies...

the danes character finally let's buddy have the awful truth. ""leave me alone, kiss men if you want to," she screams self-righteously in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. nice girl. this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character. great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except, maybe, seeing this film. wait a minute. this irony is intended! this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit, yes! but somehow i doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind, sadly. maybe there are a few mistakes, after all.

after seeing the trailer for evening, you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved, (i mean they even got rocky horror's own brad, barry bostwick, to show the world he is still acting), and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. while not entirely true, the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. this is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and harris killed buddy soon plays out. no matter what happens, though, the film is not about these people and what they do, good or bad. it is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. what may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen.the story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present (ann on her deathbed), dreamstate (ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind), and the past (ann meeting harris at her best friend's wedding). there are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt, and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring, but overall it is handled better than at first thought. it's not as though ann's life now is uninteresting, it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. while i grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for ann's children currently, i was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as i maybe should have. there are some nice moments, though, for instance, the crash that awakens ann from slumber being mirrored later on, and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together.it is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. these performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when our time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. no matter how annoying i find claire danes' angry/sad/crying face that exists in every role she plays, the girl is good at what she does. i find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. patrick wilson is always great in whatever i've seen him in. you must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. from angels in america to last year's little children, the guy will soon blow up, but hopefully he will stay true to the craft and not cash-in. heck even mamie gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother meryl streep, (who surprisingly is in the film very little). she is still rough around the edges, but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. the real revelation, though, is hugh dancy. i feel i've seen him in many things, but in fact it seems only in king arthur. dancy literally steals every scene he is in and the way in which his role of buddy is devastated by love/alcohol/life is etched in his facial expressions throughout. without his performance, the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse.while not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after, evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. you may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together, but you can't argue that the acting isn't worth sticking around for. maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see, however, when it is all put together, there may also be something coming out of it that couldn't have been achieved without all the other story threads. either way, the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.

while in her deathbed, ann lord (vanessa redgrave) repeats the name "harris" and recalls the day on the 50's when she was an aspirant singer and traveled from new york to be the maid of honor of her wealthy friend lila wittenborn (mamie gummer) in newport. ann grant (claire danes) is welcomed by lila's alcoholic and reckless brother buddy (hugh dancy) in the wittenborn's cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant harris arden (patrick wilson), who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine. later the bride-to-be confesses her true feelings about harris to ann. however, when ann meets harris, she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with buddy. meanwhile ann's daughters, the insecure and unstable nina mars (toni collette) and the happy wife and mother constance haverford (natasha richardson), are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved."evening" has one of the best feminine casts i have ever seen in a movie, with magnificent performances. the resemblance of the stunning mamie gummer with her mother meryl streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother. the locations, costumes, set decoration, cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. unfortunately the plot is confused and i have not clearly understood the message of this film. why motherhood is so important in the story? was constance engendered in the night stand of ann and harris and he would be her father? why ann and harris have not stayed together, if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in new york? which issues ann lord has resolved after the visit of lila ross? was buddy wittenborn bisexual or his love for harris was a fraternal love? why nina mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end? it seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "ao entardecer" ("in the eventide")

i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy, a romantic love story, and a very sad story plot. everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film. it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards. with the mention of beautiful scenario, and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone, it was sort of much more cunning, sad, and brilliant than those films. the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years, and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well. the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat. you really get to know all the characters and by the end, i was wanting to watch it all over again. this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is. all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go. i loved it, and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film...

this is not a profound movie; most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and "tried and true" but it was well-acted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the movie calls them) as we look back over our lives. i had not read the book, so didn't know much other than it was the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from long ago that she hasn't really shared with anyone. thankfully they got a top-notch cast....merylstreep's daughter, mamie gummer, plays the young lila, and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila...in addition to an amazing resemblance (duh!) the younger actress did a great job (perhaps not quite up to her mom's caliber, but who is?) all others in this film were fine, although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic. this is more of a girls' movie than for the guys, but a good one to see with your mom, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialog going. how hard it is to really know a parent as a "person"!

i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night, with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing. i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death. i have had many such losses, and this movie spoke to me. one of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions/issues/stories with our loved ones until it's too late--they're too incapacitated or dead before that happens. talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love them, resolve differences. i loved the message that there are no mistakes. i love the director's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters--as one of six siblings, it's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are. his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear--what a beautiful movie! the casting is outstanding--a film not to be missed!

i saw this movie sunday afternoon. i absolutely loved this movie. i loved everything about it, from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer (lila) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love. i loved these moments because they were just so real. at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby, which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it. but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different. you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time. trust me when i say go see it!

halfway through lajos koltai's "evening," a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: "can you tell me where my life went?" the line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears your heart out.time and again, the film based on susan minot's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have. with only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being sara polley's "away from her." hollywood might have turned "evening" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson, and meryl streep and mamie gummer. richardson is redgrave's daughter in the film (with a sister played by tony collette), and gummer plays streep's younger self, while redgrave's youthful incarnation is claire danes.add glenn close, eileen atkins, hugh dancy, patrick wilson, and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform. instead, koltai - the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of "mephisto," and director of "fateless" - created a subtle ensemble work with a "continental feel," the story taking place in a high-society newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble.missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, koltai's direction, and selfless acting raise "evening" way above that level, into the the rarified air of english, french (and a few american) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting.complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly. individual tunes are woven into a symphony.and yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of "evening" still shine through, redgrave, richardson, gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), danes carrying most of the load - until streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission too.as with "away from her," "evening" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises. at two hours, the film runs a bit long, but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn.

evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother. the movie split in time, is magically shot, amazingly acted and has a touching script. vanessa redgrave plays anne grant lord, a woman sun-setting out of life. lying in her bed, her mind remembering and misfiring, she recalls her first mistake. claire danes plays the young anne, giving a youthful vitality to dying bed ridden woman. daughters nina (toni collette) and constance (natasha richardson) try to decipher the real story from the disheartening dementia. her first mistake revolves around harris arden (patrick wilson); the man her best friend lila (mamie gummer) deeply loved. the daughters must come to terms with their mother's past, and their futures. the cast is glowing in evening. the collective acting energy of this movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this entire film. i am so glad to see claire danes working again, especially in this role. she is so young, and alive, fully living the joys, mistakes and heartbreak of young anne's first mistake. this is a true feat when you realize she is playing a woman, dying in bed. when her life overwhelms her, you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless hope that she won't. some of her facial expressions grinded on me a little, but over all her performance was so radiant, i was left with that only as a side note. toni collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress without being a super model. she plays the black sheep of the family; a little lost. nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's mistake. collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who revels in the mistakes of her mother, instead choosing the wiser path of learning from her mother's mistakes. there is a great deal of infighting between nina and her sister constance. their fights remind me of ones i have with my sister all the time. mamie gummer, who plays anne's youthful best friend, is wonderful. her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society. even when she is crying and her heart is breaking, she is incredibly regal and charming. i can't wait to see her act in something else in the future. vanessa redgrave's performance is very hard for me to describe. her talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or even especially tragic is why it is so powerful. the audience does not know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if these events truly happened. physically and emotionally speaking, redgrave is acting in a box. not much physical space and limited emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she makes the limitations work for her. i was constantly amazed. the movie is definitely woman-focused but the men in the movie are not just accessories. patrick wilson is mesmerizing as harris. it is no wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him, i sure was. buddy wittenborn is lila's brother, spiraling out of control. hugh dancy spirals buddy out of control without sending his acting down the drain. glen close has my favorite scene in the movie. it reminded me of the famous scene from monster's ball. it is terrible and jaw dropping grief. i was utterly stunned. the one acting disappointment was natasha richardson. while her fight scenes were memorable, most of her acting reeks of melodrama. it would have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her stink. it's a good thing she wasn't in charge of the visuals. the visuals of the movie are sparkling. cinematographer gyula pados couldn't make a film richer in color, light so perfectly matched to mood and emotion. the visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating. there were many scenes that could have been stopped, printed, mounted and sold as art. i admit it, i cried. evening is a powerful movie. evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick. if you want to impress a woman with a movie choice, pick evening.

i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend. evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such, but i can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a red-blooded male to watch. except for a single instance at the very end of the movie, i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama. ladies, for their part, will absolutely love this movie.ann lord is elderly, bed-ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side. discomfited by the memories of her past, ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before: harris. while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times, ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris - and in doing so, lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with.both ann and her two daughters - one married with children, one a serial "commitophobe" - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more importantly, if true love can endure the test of time. are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters.the cinematography for evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in ann's mind as she recalls the past, and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed, to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real, but occurred in the past). claire danes is beautiful (appearing to be really, really tall, though just 5' 5" in reality), and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test.you can't really talk trash about the cast, which leads off with claire danes and doesn't let up from there: vanessa redgrave, patrick wilson, meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film.i can't really say anything negative about this film at all, though hugh dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss. playing the spoiled, lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them.in the end, gentlemen, your lady friend will most certainly weep, and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected, the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening. catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick. it'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all.

since starting to read the book this movie is based on, i'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book, because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film. this would undoubtedly have been true here, whereas in the case of atonement, which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i've ever seen, it would probably not have mattered.i'm trying to figure out what the cause is, and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham. much as i respect him for the hours (which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by) i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.it's not that i dislike the movie. i actually love the movie, which is why, since i started reading the novel, i'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. i feel disloyal to ms. minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. reading it, i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. unlike what one reviewer of the movie said, it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. ms. minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character, so internally, that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. even though a lot of the book is memory of real events, it is memory, and so fragmented and ethereal as to be, i feel, not filmable. i think that ms. minton's work is a real work of literature, but cannot make the transition to film, which in no way detracts from its value.i cannot yet report that evening, the film, does not represent evening, the novel, in any more than the most superficial way, since i'm only halfway through, but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. i guess i'm writing this because i feel that if you're going to adapt a novel, adapt it, but don't make it something else that it's not. i'm not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original, but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs. dalloway, and we would not have evening, in its distressed form, if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. but it's too much to say that it would be better if ms. minton had left well enough alone, because evening, the film, is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.thus my confusion, mixed feelings, sense of disloyalty, and ultimate conclusion that, in this case, the novel cannot be the film and vice versa, and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did, so that we have both works as they are.

saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival, and it's a stick-to-your-bones movie -- it's really stayed with me. adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel, it's a back-and-forth-in-time drama with fully rounded characters, thoughtful rumination on life choices, and, i'm not exaggerating. one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100+ years of movie-making. wonderful work from everyone, led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying, deluded newport matron, and claire danes as her much younger self. meryl streep's daughter mamie gummer is, like mama, the real deal; patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesn't overplay the charm; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp, detailed cameos. hugh dancy, also from the stage, doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichéd role of an unhappy rich wastrel, and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. but it's a deliberately paced, visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues, and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being recklessly manipulated. also, what a sumptuous parade of 1940s/50s automobiles.

`stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley. she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. over time they become romantically involved. after stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in chicago, only to return to iris and ask her to marry him.it's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. a good film all round. 

based on robert louis stevenson's st. ives, the film tells the story of a dashing young french hussar captain (jean marc barr) during the napoleonic wars. captured in battle he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the scottish highlands, run by major farquhar (richard e grant) in short order he falls in love with a local girl (anna friel), strikes up a friendship with the major, and discovers that his long lost grandfather, who fled from france during the revolution, lives just up the road! spirited performances from all the cast and some memorable lines make this an above average offering.

what a fun movie st. ives is. it reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's. classic story, rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated. in fact it isn't over anything. robert lewis stevenson's story - here adapted for the screen - reads like jane austen for men. we do get a tale that has a romance at its heart, but there is plenty of fun too: battle scenes (sort of), prison escapes, mistaken identities, swordplay, and the funniest line i've heard in years: "only in scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball." there is much hilarity, hardship, and not a little heartbreak as st. ives tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew.the cast is absolutely stellar with the too infrequently seen jean marc barr absolutely perfect in the title role. anna friel is a refreshing delight as the resourceful flora and miranda richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and worldly, been there and seen-it-all aunt susan. richard grant provides comic relief of the highest order.this is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen, but its charms are undeniable and the entire film fairly bristles with an energy that bursts with life.

exquisite comedy starring marian davies (with the affable william haines). young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom. cameo performances showcase "all the stars in mgm's heaven" in the famous commissary scene, plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar. pic also captures for posterity davies' famous, wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day (her swanson is a beaut!)."peggy," even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis, turns up her nose and comments, "ohh, i don't like her!"my print was perfect. story, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados.

first of all, 'st. ives' the film is only fairly loosely based on the robert louis stevenson story of the same name, but for once, this is not a criticism. the original novel was a work-in-progress, unfinished at the author's death, and in freely adapting it and giving it an ending, the film-makers have brought to life some endearing characters who, although different from stevenson's originals, would, i am sure, have charmed and amused him.it is 1813: capitaine jacques de kéroual de saint-yves is a breton aristocrat, orphaned by the revolution's guillotine, now serving as a hussar in napoleon's army. we meet him going out for the evening, claiming that since a hussar who is not dead by 30 is "a blackguard", he, at 34, is now "on borrowed time"! certainly, as he faces a string of challenges to duels, our dashing hero seems in danger, but a surreal prank on his colonel provides him a way out of the duels and into the bed of a beautiful courtesan/singer. unfortunately, it also results in losing his commission... further misadventures result in him being taken prisoner by the british, and sent to a pow camp in a scottish castle.while carving toys and boxes, jacques catches the attention of flora, the young niece of miss susan gilchrist, a well-travelled woman of the world who lives at swanston cottage. they fall in love, and most of the story concerns flora helping jacques to escape and to find his emigré grandfather, the old comte. of course, there is a problem. jacques' older brother, alain, a dissolute alcoholic, is - perhaps understandably - far from pleased when grandfather disinherits him in front of the whole household, the very instant that jacques has appeared... cue treachery! there is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward, naïf but good-hearted major farquhar chevening and aunt susan, who has travelled through most of the ottoman empire and been a prisoner of the turks.even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the heroines share my surname, 'st. ives' is magic! it combines splendidly swashbuckling swordfights, a balloon-flight, comedy and romantic adventure. i would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don't make anymore' - fairbanks, colman, flynn, & co. the acting is splendid. anna friel makes flora a spirited and appealing heroine, and jean-marc barr is delightful as jacques, a genuinely lovable hero. miranda richardson and richard e. grant are already great favourites of mine, and have great fun as susan and farquhar, whose relationship runs as a comic counterpoint to that of the leads. as the rakish, scheming, but ultimately tragic alain, jason isaacs shows, as he did more recently in 'the patriot', that he has the classic swashbuckling style, besides the dashing good looks! please, please will someone cast him as a *hero* in the genre?!!!my main quibbles with the film concern settings and costumes. in the book, the castle in which jacques is a prisoner is clearly edinburgh, but the film, shot in ireland, germany and france has 'highlandised' the setting, making the retention of place names such as swanston, inveresk and queensferry decidedly incongruous. the costumes too are a real hotch-potch, from 1780s through to the period in which it is set. while this would not be implausible with more down-market characters "making do", it seems odd for well-to-do ladies such as the heroines to be wearing 1780s gowns in 1813. clearly, the costuming decision was æsthetic: these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than regency fashions, and they work in the idealised world of the film. as a whole, 'st. ives' is 90 minutes of pure delight.

there are no people like "show people" marion davies (as peggy pepper) and william haines (as billy boone). my introduction to ms. davies was a "clip" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. my introduction to mr. haines was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role. haines makes an incredible impression, when he joins davies for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table. indeed, haines and davies deliver great comic performances.the story starts off with dell henderson (colonel pepper) driving daughter davies into hollywood, certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation. indeed, davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars. but, davies yearns to become a true drama queen. davies leaves haines, and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli. but, audiences prefer davies in more comic roles; perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life? full of great hollywood location footage, both on the set, and off. full of great "cameos"; at a studio lunch, at the stars' table, davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s. hart. the best "bit" player, however, is charlie chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph! while the cameos are fun, they, and the episodic sequences, do help "show people" become less of an important film, and more of an important historical document. ******** show people (11/11/28) king vidor ~ marion davies, william haines, dell henderson

i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of "show people". i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters, plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words. seeing the cameo, out-of-character appearances of so many m-g-m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself. i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie, patricia pepoire. make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of "i don't think i like her!" pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history. enjoy!

there are some wonderful things about this movie. marion davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. william haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular leading men. (until a potential scandal forced him from the business).the story is a bit trite, but handled so beautifully that you don't notice. king vidor's direction is one of the principle reasons for this. the producer? the boy genius, irving thalberg.it's about movie making, and you get to see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, directors directing and actors emoting. you get to see (briefly) some of the major stars of the day; even charlie chaplin does a turn as himself, seeking an autograph. you also catch glimpses of eleanor boardman, elinor glyn, claire windsor, king vidor, and many others who are otherwise just names and old photographs.please, even if you're not a fan of the silents, take the time to catch this film when you can. it's really a terrific trip back in time.

marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy "show people" released by mgm in 1928. davies plays a hick from savannah, georgia, who arrives in hollywood with her father (dell henderson). the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is davies outrageous southern costume. davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. she meets fellow slapstick star william haines, who is immediately smitten with her. well, davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("high art studios") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. a handsome but fake actor (andre telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star. davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. marion davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a "serious" actress. william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by charles chaplin, john gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, king vidor. this is a silent film with a few "sound effects" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. a treasure of a film.

arthur bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people 'below him' in social standing - he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter.he drinks quite a lot too, and sometimes he is driving while drinking, too, which of course is not funny, ever. the movie is great but behind the comedy is some reality, too. john gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages. talk about deserving an oscar. moore and minnelli have their moments, but its gielgud as "hobson" you'll remember the most.

written and directed by steve gordon. running time: 97 minutes. classified pg.it was the quintessential comedy of the decade. it won sir john gielgud the academy award. it was even featured in vh1's "i love the 80's." and it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by dudley moore in an oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. while the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. arthur bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. especially when he delivers lines such as, "don't you wish you were me? i know i do!" he's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen, he's not ashamed of being filthy rich. in one scene, a man asks him, "what does it feel like to have all that money?," to which he responds, "it feels great." moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience. and gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him. arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally. the screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. this is the kind of movie that, when together with a bunch of poker buddies, you quote endlessly to one another. it also looks at its characters with sincere empathy. there have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star (including both grumpy old men's), but few can carry it off because we just don't care. when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler, it actually works, because we genuinely like these people. why should you see arthur? the answer is simple: because it's an all-around, non-guilty pleasure. at a period in which films are becoming more and more serious, arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time.**** - classic

i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie. but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago. my sister told me i had to see it. now my whole family has it memorized. we quote it at least once a day. i absolutly love this movie.i still laugh after all this time. sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible. the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. and that he is willing to give it all up for love. i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. a lot of laughs. its hallarious, sweet, and if your a movie buff, it will truely change your idea of "funny". watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head. it will make you laugh for years to come.it is really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. but this movie, i feel, made us closer. and i know it will do the same for you!!

i'm a huge classic film buff, but am just getting in to silent movies. a lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but show people is a notable exception.marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture. davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously.show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film. (i know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.show people is a perfect introduction to silent films. it is a fast paced, interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars. add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs.

dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. without dudley moore, john gielgud, liza minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the "psycho"-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. the character arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. but he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. the end is fairly corny, though. i wont give it away, but it could be improved. worth seeing many times.

as drunken millionaire playboy arthur bach, dudley moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. as it turned out, the role fit moore so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor as well. many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel), yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. some of moore's drunk scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. it has a very big heart and gives oscar-winner john gielgud a sly, dryly amusing role as arthur's valet, hobson; his relationship with arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. liza minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and moore is brash, but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of arthur, but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from ****

 what can i say? this is one of the most perfect films ever made. its a throwback to the glitxy,sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.the screenplay bursts with wit,charm,humor and tenderness,the cinematograpy is breathtaking(nyc never looked so beautiful),and of course there is the cast! dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable,drunken arthur bach. he is also wistful and real..one of the film's best lines is his poignant "not everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we're not poets." the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson,arthur's valet and caretaker.although he considered it a "take the money and run role",he brings to the character all the talent ,experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. the supporting cast is also out of thisworld,from geraldine fitzgerald's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott's bombastic mafioso. the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.

excellent comedy starred by dudley moore supported by liza minnelli and good-speaking john gielgud. moore is arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family, who was near to get 750 million dollars provided that he marries to a lady (susan) from another multimillionaire family. in principle, arthur accepted the conditions, but he finally refused when he met nice and poor linda marolla (liza minneli). arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. after several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, arthur decided not to marry susan only few minutes before their wedding. the end was happy for linda and arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future. this comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone. rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.

this is one of my favorite comedies ever. not wanting to condone the uninspiring lifestyle of its hero, but taken for what it's worth and not as trivializing alcoholism, the movie is simply a lot of fun. it tells the unlikely tale of a perpetually drunk, irresponsible 40 something bachelor named arthur who is set to inherit a vast fortune, but only if he marries susan, chosen because the family thinks she might make something of him. arthur proposes, but then unwisely falls for linda, a waitress and petty thief.dudley moore is perfect as arthur, the world's most endearing drunk, whose antics are a laugh a minute. admittedly, moore is arthur and i agree with those who can imagine no other actor in the role. the ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. liza minnelli sparkles as linda, and her on screen chemistry with moore is great. jill clayburgh plays susan, the wealthy and more appropriate woman chosen for arthur. however, this film is literally made by sir john gielgud, who portrays arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, hobson. it's obvious these two have had a great mutual affection during hobson's longtime employment. hobson is arthur's best friend and purveyor of unsolicited commentary and advice. the most interesting relationship in this film is not arthur's romance at all, but his unusual rapport with this witty and of course perpetually disapproving servant. it's the butler you'll remember best long after the closing credits roll.

this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time. recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old, grainy vhs versions.i hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time. it's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (truly funny line after truly funny line) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time.dudley moore got an oscar nomination for "arthur" but lost (although john gielgud won for best supporting actor). if moore's performance in "arthur" doesn't win a best actor oscar -it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is gene wilder in "young frankenstein").steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story. quite simply, imho the movie is a rare gem. it's only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after "arthur" was released.regarding the dvd that is available as of 1/2007, it's so/so. although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies, there is still no widescreen version available.the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough. one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit. the dvd, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well.this, the original "arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.

i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981! i have lost track of how many times i have seen it! it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down. the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless, plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song? i think i quote this movie without realizing it. i basically know the entire script, so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it. i can't even narrow it down, although, sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones. the famous "i'll alert the media" when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. the scene's at arthur's soon to be fiancé's father's house are a scream, particularly his interactions with the moose. do yourself a favour and see this movie!

arthur is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish. arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. he likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. he spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny. arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress liza minnelli (she looks really weird).this is a damn funny film. i watched this film because a very famous indian film 'sharabee' is based on the character of arthur. although 'sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'arthur' i think they are two different films. 'arthur' is just fun. its very corny at times. there are so many fantastic one liners in the film. its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. my favorite scene is when arthur meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. duddley moore sure has some comic timing. he is very good with words and body language. i loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. john gielgud got an oscar for this film. i don't know that actor. i don't think he did a great job but may be if i watched more of his work i may agree in future. movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.

"if i wanted to dribble, i'd call a nurse." "haven't you had enough?" ..."more than enough.""you got me a choo-choo.""if i begin to die, please remove (the cowboy hat) from my head. that is not the way i wish to be remembered." some of the wonderfully humorous, and often insightful, quotations from this charming and often insightful film. dudley moore is charming, lovable and rich. sir john gielgud is aristocratic, charming and loving...and poor. the two have a non-father/father and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become. will he follow his heart and soul, or just his wealth? over twenty-five years, i've returned to this movie, with glee and amusement and joy. it is a movie to return to, time and time again, and remember what is important in life, as short as it is. judge miller

my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. we have most lines memorized. i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays. liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though i'm not her biggest fan. this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. his conversation with the butler and susan's father is side-spitting. the line from the butler, "would you care to wait in the library" followed by arthur's reply, "yes i would, the bathroom is out of the question", is my newmail notification on my computer. "arthur is truly "funny stuff"!

1928 is in many ways a "lost year" in motion pictures. just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology."show people" is one of the great silent era comedies. the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane. she had excellent comic instincts and timing. this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper (marion davies) and her father, general marmaduke oldfish pepper, fresh from the old south. general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. while at the studio commissary, the peppers run into billy boone (william haines), a slapstick comedian. he gets peggy an acting job. she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes.one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930. this film is one of those, as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph, an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself, and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot. peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while. this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible.

this is one of those movies that i've seen so many times that i can quote most of it. some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.i don't know how many times i have seen this sequence but it's funny every time. from the moment arthur gets to susan's dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much laugh the whole time. i remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. it went down just like i'd imagined it'd be like. they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. his demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious. it's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. i laugh every time i listen to the "i'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow.

when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under-utilised asset the late dudley moore was. there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive.he was already top-notch talent before he went to hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook, on television and in one or two indifferent british movies. perhaps the best of these was 'bedazzled'. he always tended to be eclipsed by cook, who's jealousy and meanness rifted their partnership and enabled moore to realise his true potential in america. 'arthur' is the result. this is a truly splendid movie. moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is undeniable. the script is perfectly suited to his manner with lot's of hilarious, almost surreal conversational digressions. there is something so british about him that i'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes. tommy cooper, an anarchic comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank. it is moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing.liza minelli and john guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some excellent one-liners. john guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and acerbic authority that is a treasure to watch. he invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar. correct me if i'm wrong, but he has never played any other comic role.there is a follow-up movie called 'arthur 2 - on the rocks'. it never attains the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches, but it is still rather good even so. guilgud only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost. it is darker. and there is some interesting soul-searching. it will disappoint if you watch 'arthur' first.hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly dudley after these two outings. he eventually returned to britain, dejected and apparently dying.but 'arthur' is a sample of what might have been. we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made.your're sadly missed, dudley.

after seeing arthur on tv numerous times i laughed so hard dudley moore's role as arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but john gielgud as his servant/ father figure hobson was equally charming. i bought the dvd a few weeks ago and watched it, despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was liza minnelli's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic.arthur bach, (moore) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child. his activities are supervised by his dry english butler hobson (gielgud) it appears that nobody really cares about arthur except for him, arthur's father (barbour) offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite susan johnson (eikenberry) in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of 750 million dollars.however arthur meets and falls in love with linda marolla (minnelli)a young working class waitress and tie thief,now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money. when hobson dies arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with susan before the wedding, leaving him to keep both the money and his true love.arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone

although it's most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk, there's such a charm to dudley moore's portrayal of lovable lush, arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness. although i'm not really a liza minnelli fan, she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role. sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar. the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune "arthur's theme", wow. truly this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with "arthur."

i remember trying a few minutes of this film, i'm very surprised i didn't watch all of it, from director steve gordon, his only film directed before dying of heart failure. basically arthur bach (golden globe winning, and oscar nominated dudley moore) is the happy drunk millionaire with everything he could want, a mansion, a butler hobson (oscar and golden globe winning, and bafta nominated sir john gielgud), and plenty of booze. he is to inherit $750,000,000 if he marries the daughter of fellow millionaire burt johnson (stephen elliott), they woman he and the family have chosen, susan (jill eikenberry). but instead, arthur finds himself falling for queens waitress linda marolla (golden globe nominated liza minnelli), which of course is threatening the inheritance, and 3/4 of his family's fortune from father stanford (thomas barbour) and aunt martha (geraldine fitzgerald). after the death of hobson, arthur, on the day of the wedding, disobeys the family's wishes, but aunt martha still gives arthur the inheritance to live happily ever after with true love linda. also starring ted ross as bitterman, barney martin as ralph marolla, anne de salvo as gloria - hooker, maurice copeland as uncle peter bach, justine johnston as aunt pearl bach, florence tarlow as mrs. nesbitt, marcella lowery as harriet - martha's maid, john bentley as perry and peter evans as preston langley - party guest. moore is wonderfully funny and a little cringing as the almost always drunk millionaire, minnelli is likable as the woman he loves, and gielgud of course makes a great oscar winning impression as moore's humorous humble sarcastic servant, a terrific screwball comedy. it won the oscar for best song for "arthur's theme (best that you can do)" (it also won the golden globe) (it was number 79 on 100 years, 100 songs), and it was nominated best writing, screenplay written directly for the screen, it was nominated the bafta anthony asquith award for film music for burt bacharach, and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical. sir john gielgud was number 35 on the 50 greatest british actors, and the film was number 53 on 100 years, 100 laughs. very good!

i watched this over the christmas period, i don't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it, so there we are. arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances, great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it. dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily (spoiled, rich, lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love. liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough/soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for. john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish. i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film.

arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation. frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.secondly though, i actually knew a real life arthur bach. he was not quite as wealthy as arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. his parents tightly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village. he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like dudley moore does. the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. but that's the other half of the equation. my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. he couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. he spent his life being a perfect party guest. the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.and that's what dudley moore is, a wastrel. unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him. that's a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur. my friend also never found a liza minnelli, a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay. still moore's portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry. since he won't work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to. we should all have such troubles.john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time. the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime. that man was amazing, still at his craft almost to the end.so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss, a genuine real life arthur, i dedicate this review.

again, it seems totally illogical, to me at least, that "arthur" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. steve gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally "unlikely" if not quite "impossible" melding of wildly disparate elements. that he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is, in itself, wonderful. that he gave dudley moore his finest role, and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact, including the score, seems to me patent and egregious. i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. but, apparently, nearly a third of its audience has so managed. well, i, for one, found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable, and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great-aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters. even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization, and the late, sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee, but wrong about undertaking his role. "arthur" makes no effort to "underztand," much less rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, ifit ain't booze, it's other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are merely symptoms, not targets), it simply observes in its own quizzical manner.

the father of the who's alcoholic drummer, keith moon, was named arthur. i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie. liza minelli, who usually overacts, did quite a good job in this one, and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn. yes, i agree, sir john stole absolutely every scene. it was a very "different" movie, enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life. we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite. god rest dudley moore; this was such an enjoyable movie. much satire and thumbs down to the rich and snobby/affluent. the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing.

arthur bach needs to grow up, but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do. according to his extremely rich father, arthur has to marry a certain wealthy susan johnson or he's cut off from the family money ($750 million dollars worth). the problem is, arthur doesn't love susan (though i hear she makes some good chicken) and has just fallen head-over-heels for the waitress and part-time shop-lifter linda marolla. arthur is an interesting fellow. he's really just a big kid, born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day. working just rubs arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun, womanize, and of course, drink. drinking gives arthur a sort of jekyll-and-hyde complex; and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen. dudley moore is great here in this film as arthur, earning an oscar nomination and golden globe win for his performance. moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film, turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold, but he is also great in bringing arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable. moore has some help in the co-star department - liza minnelli is great as lina, the spirited nobody who arthur can't get enough of, and john gielgud is terrific as arthur's butler hobson. gielgud won the best supporting actor oscar for his performance in this film, and there's no doubting why. hobson has a stone-solid dry wit and stuck up attitude, but he's always looking out for arthur - and gielgud is perfect in the role. steve gordon's 1981 film arthur is short and simple, but delivers laughs a-plenty.

i just read the comments of tomreynolds2004 and feel i have to jump in here. i understand he doesn't like the film, but his reasons are not evident. my feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sorrow. each of these two people, as portrayed, have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry, yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. i really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. i have every reason to dislike jane fonda for her vietnam era actions, but personal feelings apart, she is fabulous in this role. robert deniro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. this is the first i have seen deniro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and i really like it. this film was a big surprise when i first viewed it and i look forward to seeing it again.

i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really couldn't understand her appeal. she couldn't dance for peanuts, she didn't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance. but i hadn't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful. rather than kidding her own image, as has been suggested here, to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson, who did start off in slapstick comedies, went on to highly emotional women's pictures and did end up marrying a count. marion, a top mimic, also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand, that was gloria swanson spot on!!!colonel pepper (dell henderson) has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood, determined to prove that his daughter, peggy, (marion davies) will be the greatest star ever. their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone (william haines) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job. peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic. they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success. charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she doesn't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely. "who was that short little guy" - when she finds out she faints!!! peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way. there is a funny scene where she sees a star she doesn't think much of - it's marion davies!!!she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she can't cry!!! it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds, she can't stop!!! her new leading man, andre (paul ralli) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - patricia pepoire!!! she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad - she has developed a "star" personality!!! when the slapstick studio picks the same location as "patricia's" movie, billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude. when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew. after a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day) "patricia" gets a call from the boss. it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back. she and andre decide to get married, she dreams of being a countess (even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a count than he is). on her wedding day, billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for her.it was amazing to see all the guest stars - john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates, lew cody is talking to elinor glynn, who not only wrote "it" but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies. william haines, another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see, was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing. harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all - i'm giving this film 10 out of 10.highly, highly recommended.

the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's arthur, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach, a drunken playboy who "races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss." arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston (jill eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla (liza minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, hobson, whose outward disdain for arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda's father. stephen elliott as susan's father, and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur's demented grandmother. the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. there was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.

it's hard to put your finger on this one. basically i suppose it's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a (comparatively) poor girl, whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family.it has funny moments, romantic moments, and touching moments. dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centred character endearing, liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts, but john gielgud steals the show as arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler.it's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit.

let's begin with that theme song sung by christopher cross. the song is "if you get caught between the moon and new york city." it's a great theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tiring. it really is a great song about new york city as well. anyway, the great dudley moore cbe stars as a spoiled drunken millionaire who is engaged to jill eikenberry's character in the film. jill would later star on la law. anyway, he is served by his wonderful british butler, sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor. arthur falls in love with liza minnelli's character who is perfect in this film besides her performance in her oscar winning role in cabaret. no, liza doesn't get to sing. she plays a diner waitress. anyway i love geraldine fitzgerald as the bach matriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune. anyway, she is fabulous and should have gotten an academy award nomination herself for best supporting actress. barney martin best known as jerry's dad on seinfeld plays liza's dad. he's great too. the movie was well-written, acted, and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.

ok, even if you can't stand liza- this movie is truly hilarious! the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza. one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century. dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch! the one-liners are the best.

this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud. sadly, gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. it's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. it plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. the plot centers on arthur bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into linda marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father.the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by moore. that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as hobson, arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. it's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. in probably her most likable film role, liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation.a pre-"la law" jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while barney martin (jerry's dad on "seinfeld") steals all his scenes as linda's slovenly father ralph. the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. and i have to admit that i still can't stand the very dated, overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year's best song. unfortunately, the 1997 dvd, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.

quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time... it's certainly on my personal top-ten list. this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale. millionaire heir, arthur bach (moore), is a middle-aged 'child' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities. he also refuses to leave the bottle. one day he and his personal butler, hobson (gielgud), go shopping at bergdorf goodman's and run into petty larcenist, linda (minnelli). arthur and linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film. there are hilarious set pieces aplenty. in one such scene, arthur (drunk throughout most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren' ("my husband has a gun!!!!). performances by everyone involved should be duly noted: geraldine fitzgerald plays arthur's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother, sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms (he took home the oscar for this one), and christopher cross provides the main theme song (oscar winner "best that you can do"). it's a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month (march 2002).

back in the day if marion davies had had her druthers and didn't just listen to william randolph hearst, she'd have done more films like show people and been a lot happier. in fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy, she'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like when knighthood was in flower and janice meredith. what you're seeing by all accounts in show people is the real davies, a gifted comedienne, a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person. she could really identify with the character of peggy pepper aka patricia prepoire, she put up with her share of pretense in her hollywood stardom.if the plot of show people was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story. i guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story. marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in hollywood like so many others, looking for that big break. she wants to drama, but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics. she gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face, but learns her trade. and also wins the heart of young comic actor william haines.she does get her first big break, but it doesn't come for haines as well and marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor paul ralli, playing andre telfair, a pretend no account count of avignon. somebody here was taking a shot at actor lou tellegen, lover and husband of sarah bernhardt and geraldine farrar and others and to hear tell of it, one of the most despised people in cinema.show people was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves. you will get to see folks like charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, mae murray, john gilbert, eleanor boardman etc., just being themselves in and around the film colony. that in itself makes show people a film worth saving.show people also made good use of standard tin pan alley songs like, ain't we got fun, i'm sitting on top of the world, you'd be surprised, california, here i come. as the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced, a song called crossroads was introduced in it. it's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack. i guess since they're not seen, it was felt no billing was necessary. still i'd like to know and i'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see show people.it's easy to see why marion davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite. she looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience.

prior to seeing show people, my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick, and slapstick only. i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls. but this masterful film proved me wrong. davies, in my view, was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball. i mention lucy primarily because davies' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn't one of ball's primary influences. this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy, and i must say that no matter how much of the period-specific references you actually get (i didn't, apparently), you will not be bored by this movie. you will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies. this is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time.

i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the ft. lauderdale film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a comment/review on. this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs, excellent acting, and an inspiring message. ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life. this is poignantly illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in various shapes and sizes enter into a pool of water. this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes, which hold your attention and imagination.

sunday july 16, 8:00pm the castro, san francisco"as a southern colonel your make-up is very indiana"the yammering gossips of hollywood have managed to sling more than a little mud in marion davies direction over the years. that she had fame handed to her and was undeserving, is often speculated. considering the mawkish dramas she was so often pushed into, this criticism would seem to have some validity. as a comedienne however, her star shone very brightly. left to pursue a career in light comedy and slapstick she might have rivaled mabel normand. one of her better outings was king vidor's show people (1928), which survives and is so well known largely because mgm filled it with star cameos. this happy coincidence inadvertently saved what is surely among the best work of its two stars, davies and that notorious joe college wise-cracker, william haines. rumor has it show people was loosely based on the life of gloria swanson, who began in sennett comedies and rose to grand drama (and don't think she didn't spend the rest of her life reminding everyone!) with von stroheim, walsh and demille. coincidentally, the comedy studios used in this film are the original digs keystone had abandoned the year before (think of who worked there!).colonel marmaduke oldfish pepper (dell henderson) drives his daughter peggy (davies) from georgia to hollywood to star in the movies. these two country hicks are unsuspecting fodder for incorrigible billy boone (haines), "  a custard pie artist " who descends on their cafeteria table in an outrageously funny entrance (watch for the bit with the noodle), and then helps peggy land a part in his next picture. what she thinks is high drama turns out to be screwball, but a job is a job and billy convinces her " . . all the stars have to take it on the chin  ". at the preview, billy and peggy bump into .. charlie chaplin, who asks for her autograph! she pushes the little fellow aside and a horrified billy grabs the book and makes her sign. chaplin climbs in his car and billy tells peggy who shes just snubbed, so naturally, she faints. it's so very funny, considering davies character isn't supposed to recognize this guy! peggy soon moves on to work at the high art studios, changes her name to 'patricia pepoire' and leaves poor billy behind. davies does a wonderful send-up of a serious actress, with all the prerequisite fluttering eyelashes and quivering lips. vidor throws in a parade of stars eating lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder, facing the camera!) that includes polly moran (who's also sensationally funny playing davies' maid), louella parsons (one of the friendly vampires), estelle taylor, claire windsor aileen pringle, the comedy duo of karl dane (with his arm in a sling) and george k. arthur (pretending he's stealing the silverware), leatrice joy (amused by arthur's antics), renee adoree, rod (eating and smoking) la rocque, mae murray, john (in a robe) gilbert (who also appears driving through the mgm gates early in the picture), norma (eeeww!) talmadge (looking bitchy and aloof as usual) and patricia dressed like marie antoinette, sandwiched between douglas fairbanks (as he does an amusing trick) and william s. hart (protecting her from doug). billy runs into the high art crew on location when the comedy troupe disrupts their filming, with predictably nutty results. vidor even works himself into the final scene as the director of peggy's current production. also worth noting are harry gribbon as the comedy director doing a great caricature of eddie sedgwick, sidney bracy as the dramatic director who can't get peggy to cry for her screen test and then can't stop her once she does, and paul ralli as andre, her dramatic love interest and a hilarious phony. when her character tries to 'act' its as though davies is poking fun at all the awful dramas she'd been forced into and she's brilliant doing it.while it's true show people is a hokey satire of the 'good ole days' ten years hence, it remains a highly entertaining example of quality work from mgm, irving thalberg, and their tremendous wealth of assembled talent. what a shame so much has been lost. there are also far too many examples of great films like the patsy (1928), vidor and davies' hugely successful comedy from earlier that same year, languishing in vaults when they could be seen and enjoyed.

this film is hilarious, original, & beautifully directed. i have become a big bad swim groupie, tracking it to film festivals whenever & wherever i can. i've seen it about half a dozen times now, & each time, enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years. at nearly every festival it has screened, it has either sold out, or won the audience favorite award. it's clear that people love this film, & even clearer why they do. the cinematography is superb, the characterization & acting brilliant, the ending fantastic, & the direction filled with compassion, wisdom & the art of perfect timing. it's hard to believe this is ishai setton's first film. i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.

a community pool in connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" film which is charming, funny, entertaining, and appealing. although it won prizes in major film festivals, "the big bad swim" was not released to hordes of theaters across america, but was distributed in dvd form, and shown in theaters selectively. it is unfortunate that "the big bad swim" never had the marketing hype of a hollywood release, considering how many sinkers hollywood has released this year, such as "i know who killed me." "the big bad swim," a genuinely good independent film, has had to swim upstream on its own.nevertheless, in "the big bad swim," actress paget brewster is endearing and believable as amy, the wired-to-breaking point math teacher who not only is being dumped by her husband but also is about to lose her job, and ends up taking a gamble on a new life. tv soap actor jeff branson-- who is hot-- plays noah, the earnest, vulnerable swim teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears, and discovers he can learn from his students. pretty, sexy jess weixler (did i just see her in a bank commercial?) deftly plays jordan, the swimmer-to-be who works two jobs, one as a pole dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer. her character provides the catalyst for change amongst the ensemble, but is the least understandable of the characters, because of a lack of a "back story" or motivation as to why she does what she does. jordan is young enough to still live at home with a ubiquitous, video-camera-toting younger brother who spies on her. however, her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way, which seems odd. there's no drunken mother or abusive father here to explain why a normal, attractive girl from a connecticut suburb would choose to be a self-medicating pole dancer who debases herself for loutish bachelor parties. despite this quibble, "the big bad swim" succeeds, in large part, because it is a happy, feel good film.as one might expect, learning to swim is the metaphor for life. ultimately it's better to jump in with both feet, and get in the swim, rather than sit on the deck, because life happens to you anyway.the big bad swim is a great date movie, a great dorm movie, a great "what haven't i seen" movie, and men like it as well as women.

i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be "quirky," and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh-out-loud humor in scene after scene. there was a sophistication, maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp, i've rarely seen in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. of special note here: paget brewster's turn as amy the math teacher. after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasn't been "discovered" by a larger audience. she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience. i look forward to more from the director and this cast!

this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut. the plot is fairly thin. what drives the film is the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. the two actresses give natural performances and work well together. this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton. the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip. the film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama.

i saw the big bad swim at the 2006 temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how much i was drawn into it.the film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. a humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.what surprised me about the film was how real it felt. rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very poignant. nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, form strong bonds, and make discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. i suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...aside from this, i found the film very well-rounded and quite enjoyable. see it if you get the opportunity.

writing something genuine and true is challenging. knowing how to shoot it and putting it together without making it trivial is even better. ishai setton's movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. i have been touched by "the big bad swim" and from now on, i will promote it as far as i can. it is just a shame that i can't have something to show to my friends (you know, such as a dvd???), because talking is good...but giving something to see is better. everyone can't go to festivals to discover pearls like that and this movie's really worth to be put out there! a big thank you to the staff of this master piece, and i am waiting for it to be distributed.

this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal.i thought that avi did a great job in his role. and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see.i think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again. this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous. i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really don't want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future.

i had the pleasure of screening "the big bad swim" at the 2006 new london film festival last week. the festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream films from the past year. it was my assumption that "the big bad swim" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around eastern connecticut. however, as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well "the big bad swim" compared to the others featured during the festival. by far it topped my list, followed by "the puffy chair", "who killed the electric car" and "transamerica".the "the big bad swim" is an engaging, truthful and often-humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that i've not seen on screen in quite a while. the interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which i found refreshing. the plot doesn't beat you over the head with a direction; rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on. i was never bored. i never cringed. i never stepped out of the story on the screen.the humor of the film is something like "napoleon dynamite" meets "old school". the acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived. obviously not being a multi-million production the camera shot weren't all awe-inspiring and clear, but adequate and well done for the budget. the lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in "closer". i also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be.i sure it's said over and over from many in the independent film industry, but i have to say it: if "the big bad swim" isn't picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed. "the big bad swim" needs to be seen. if you have the chance to see this film, see it! disappointment is impossible!

the big bad swim has a low budget, indie feel about it. so many times i start to watch independent films that have had really good reviews only to find out they are pretentious crud, voted for by people who are so blinded by the idea of the film and its potential to be provocative that they forget that film is a form of entertainment first and foremost.i do not know if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor, if it does then i missed it.from the get go bbs felt right, it was easy and warm and human, there were no major dramas or meaningful insights, i just connected with the characters straight off. and when, as with all good films the end came around i felt sadness at the loss of that connection.if you are looking for something big, or fast or insightful look elsewhere, look for a film trying to deliver more than it can. bbs delivers a solid, enjoyable, real experience and i felt rewarded and satiated having watched it.

i don't know why i picked this movie to watch, it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different. every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different. right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end. i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors. at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being, and are left with the 'things are going to be ok' type of a feeling. i'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.

perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood' movie ever, especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystone.marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role. plenty of cameos for film buffs.

i was really impressed with this film. the writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich, and simple. it's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters, and getting the viewer sucked right into their world. further, the music is terrific. they employed some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like i did), i highly recommend that you go see it. also, on a personal note, paget brewster is beautiful in this movie. that's reason enough to go check it out.

i actually thought this is a comedy and sat watching it expecting to laugh my ass off. pretty soon in became clear this is no comedy, or at least not a 'jim carrey type' one. what kept we watching was the characters - the movie starts with some pretty grim, troubled people, gathered together to try and fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we start to get bit by bit into their lives, witness their troubles, guess of their thoughts.actually i made it look much darker than it actually is, and besides the chain of events soon brings some light and hope to their lives.i probably wouldn't have watched the movie had i known its not a comedy but rather a drama, but i had good time, enjoyed the story and don't mind i spent about 90 minutes with it.many films treat the alienation between people in the western world, this movie shows how people can get together and help each other"and if in the light of dying day you meet her, don't let her pass you by and leave, don't loose her, she is your gift from the sun..."9/10peace and love

i consider myself a huge movie buff. i was sick on the couch and popped in this film. right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors, i'd never seen, say great word. the filming was beautiful. it was just what i needed. i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others. the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout. thanku for making a film like this one. just wonderfully awkward, beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once. just great. i can't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director, more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer. i didn't want it to end. the end

i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in birmingham, alabama. i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screening.when i think of the films that are shown at festivals, i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. there's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making. by "mainstream," i mean more like a film produced for national release - in other words, a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater.the writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. there is nothing typically independent about this film. as an aspiring director, i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. this is one of those films. as i watched the big bad swim, my motivation level was incredible. i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production. i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. when a movie makes me feel like that, i know it's really good. this is the first feature-length project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project. for me, that's really rare.see this film. it's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance. she has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. that's a gift. i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often. jeff branson and jess weixler also did top-notch jobs. i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim. i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production.

this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. it should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.the swimming instructor is an almost-olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. he attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.the students characters are mainstream u.s.a; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. the movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.this is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.

"show people" is an absolutely delightful silent directed by king vidor and starring marion davies and billy haines. what gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, peggy pepper, whose acting is the talk of savannah trying to make it on the big screen. though she's a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make "art" so she moves up to high arts studio. soon she becomes patricia pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend billy.many stars of the silent era have cameos in "show people," including davies herself without the curly hair and makeup. i'm sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it's not the case, even for film buffs. in one part of the film, however, she does meet charlie chaplin; in another, author elinor glyn is pointed out to her, and vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. other stars who pop up in "show people" are john gilbert, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, leatrice joy, bess flowers, renee adoree, rod laroque, aileen pringle, and many others.davies was adorable and a lively comedienne. it's a shame william haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day."show people" is a simple story told in a witty way. it's also a look back at an exciting era in hollywood's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.

this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies. she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film. (i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies' style, that could be termed "zany beauty".) vidor's direction is light but sure-handed, the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary, and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. for all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films, sit through this one and it may change your attitude. 

"wisecracker," the biography of actor william haines, offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past 70 and long retired from making movies. the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films, but in 1972 he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people, the late silent feature in which he co-starred with marion davies. beforehand, haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter, but he was pleasantly surprised (and no doubt relieved) at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it. watch the film today and you can see why: show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair, yet without malice. it's still funny and its satirical points still resonate. needless to say, the technology of movie-making has changed vastly since the silent days, but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven't changed all that much.show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies, a first-rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes. where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour, the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst. it's well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies' choice of roles, and well known too that, despite her gift for comedy, he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas. by the late '20s, for whatever reason, marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies (including the red mill and the patsy), but show people, directed by the great king vidor, stands as her most enjoyable showcase. william haines gives an engaging, likable performance as her boyfriend and co-star billy boone, but this is the leading lady's show all the way.marion plays southern belle peggy pepper, an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father, determined to become a movie star. (her dad colonel pepper is played by actor/director dell henderson, a veteran of griffith's biograph dramas whocoincidentally?resembled hearst!) one of marion's funniest bits, often excerpted elsewhere, is her audition at the comet studio casting office. while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray ("sorrow! . . . joy!") and drops a handkerchief across her face, peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture. she's hired, only to discover that comet makes low-brow comedies, the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue. of course, comet is intended as a take-off of mack sennett's keystone, but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds. as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio, assuming the name "patricia peppoire" as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress. at some point it may occur to us (as it surely did to viewers in 1928) that davies' rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b. demille. and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously, giving the high-hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone, davies' performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself. this is especially notable during an interview sequence, when miss peppoire's spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot-on impersonation of swanson. i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof, but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released.in any event, show people is a delicious treat for buffs, who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout. charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit, sans makeup and looking quite distinguished, eagerly seeking patricia peppoire's autograph! (and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self-mocking cameo appearance, evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself.) this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate, at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business. show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin' in the rain, among hollywood's most expertly produced, enjoyable exercises in amused self-examination.

oh it's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while! director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself. the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger "drama" studio. she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world. for a moment she even denies her (poor) past! the cameos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (marion davies) sees...marion davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special... it's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then. a must-see if you ask me!!

i've seen hundreds of silent movies. some will always be classics (such as nosferatu, metropolis, the general and wings) but among them, my favorite is this film (it may not be the best--but a favorite, yes). in fact, when i looked it up on imdb, i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made. marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst's mistress.the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see!

'stanley and iris' show the triumph of the human spirit. for stanley, it's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential. for iris, it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together, starting and stopping, before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on. in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is, thus being credible. unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture. the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances. all in all an excellent movie. the best thing i take from it is hope.

updated from a previous comment. the great and underrated marion davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines. davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines, a bit player in crude comedies. they appear together in cheap comedies until marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star.a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretensions. davies & haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin, douglas fairbanks, william s. hart, john gilbert, elinor glyn, norma talmadge, mae murray, rod larocque, leatrice joy, dorothy sebastian, estelle taylor, louella parsons, renee adoree, aileen pringle, and marion davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies! dell henderson plays the father. polly moran is a maid. paul ralli is the slimy leading man.show people was said to have used the career of gloria swanson as its model (i think mae murray is closer). davies and swanson were friends. but this film's story does parallel the rise of swanson from one-reel mack sennett comedies with charlie chaplin to star in cecil b. demille films of the late teens and early 20s.davies and haines were huge mgm stars and friends. odd that mgm never teamed them up in a talkie. they're great together! a sweet romance and delightful spoof of early hollywood. greta garbo and bebe daniels are mentioned but do not appear.

paul & grace hartman are my husbands grandparents. they were both deceased when we met so watching old movies is a good way to see them and their work. i have always enjoyed old movies and was very happy to discover that this was also a very good one.

i thought this movie was pretty good. some parts were corny but that's understandable since it was made more than 55 years ago. i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly. jack haley is also really good as mike o'brien. even though i'm not a big frank sinatra fan, i think he was very good in this movie. if your have a craving for a silly, over the top musical comedy, higher and higher is the movie for you.

if you have never viewed this film and like old time veteran actors, this is the film for you. seeing frank sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with sunken in cheeks and a wonderful voice which sang some great old songs. michele morgan, (millie pico) gave an outstanding performance with plenty of dance and musical numbers. leon errol, (cyrus drake) gave a great supporting role along with victor borge, (sir victor fitzroy victor) who performed classical piano and no slap stick comedy like he did in his career. this is not a great musical, but frank sinatra was a great joy to see at the beginning of his career in the 1940's.

this is one of my all-time favorites. great music and some funny bits. i laugh every time at millie, the maid pretending to be a débutante, holding her dainty hankie while chatting, and mindlessly polishing furniture with it as she chats. i just never can get past her french accent never being a problem as they try to pass her off as the boss's daughter.seeing a teenage mel torme and the very young frank sinatra singing is such a treat. my mom saw frank sinatra at a theater about the same time this movie came out. she said they couldn't clear the "bobby-soxers" out between movies (in those days you didn't have to leave between showings). this movie shows you how attractive and appealing the young frank was and allows you to appreciate his early talent as well. and victor borge gets in a bit of his routine in, which is a bonus. this is a fun movie with a sweet, simple storyline. very enjoyable.

in frank sinatra's first three films, he was purely a speciality act: ostensibly playing himself, he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie. in his fourth film, the very enjoyable 'higher and higher', young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role ... a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers.sinatra's entrance is quite funny. michele morgan hears a knock at the door, and asks who's there. from outside, a hoboken-toned voice answers 'frank sinatra'. sure enough...the opening credits of 'higher and higher' may confuse some viewers, as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed. in fact, they only contributed one song to this musical: 'disgustingly rich', which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song, 'i'm a debutante'. interestingly, that rodgers & hart song -- one of their weakest -- is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score; several others are lively up-tempo numbers, notably 'it's a most important affair', 'when it comes to love, you're on your own' and 'i saw you first'.sinatra's good in this movie, but he would do better work (and sing better material) elsewhere. the real merits of 'higher and higher' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films. paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues: genuinely graceful ballroom dancers, they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material. (here, grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul's hands.) grace hartman, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform. after grace hartman's death, her husband had a long career as a character actor, just occasionally dancing solo. (or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of 'mayberry rfd'.)also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in 'higher and higher' is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire. why didn't this talented girl make more movies? perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton. i enjoy hutton's performances but i like marcy mcguire even better. near the end of 'higher and higher' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses, taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub. the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious! regrettably, although leon errol plays a large role in 'higher and higher', he is given almost no comedy business: not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance. jack haley, despite his prominent billing, is also wasted.very well-represented here is dooley wilson, inevitably remembered as sam from 'casablanca'. in that film, wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of 'as time goes by'. (in real life, wilson couldn't play piano.) here in 'higher and higher', he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players. less enjoyable is mel odious, i mean mel torme. victor borge gives a rare film performance here, handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows.the plot? forget it. 'higher and higher' is nobody's idea of a 'great' musical, but it's an enjoyable delight, and i'll rate it 8 out of 10. director tim whelan, who worked in britain as well as in hollywood, deserves to be much better known.

mel torme and victor borge, in their younger years, serve to make this film interesting - and especially viewing a young sinatra, on the sunny side of 30, and definitely conveying that this was his "yes, i'm a popular singer, but hardly an actor yet" stage. michele morgan is an annoying, inane presence, and jack haley is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me. leon erroll is silly, as always, but overall pretty funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right "grade," because with the combination of its positive aspects, along with the lack of much of a story, and a silly one at that, and the fore-mentioned annoyances - it is overall average at best. most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years.

this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it's a very enjoyable, light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. ok, so frank sinatra's "acting" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film. sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this, his first venture into hollywood, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this movie. i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago.

higher and higher was one of rodgers&hart's lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of 84 performances on broadway in 1940. yet it yielded one of their bigger hits it never entered my mind.nevertheless except for one minor song, so disgustingly rich, the entire broadway score was scrapped when rko bought the film rights. instead a whole new score by jimmy mchugh and harold adamson was written, mostly to accommodate one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debut.sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films, takes a leaf from the page of his singing rival bing crosby. when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast, he played bing crosby. frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i can't think of anyone who could have done a better job. the chairman of the board is billed third here behind stars jack haley and michele morgan. he's the butler and she's the scullery maid to leon errol. in fact errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months. mainly because he's about to go belly up into chapter 11 or so he informs the staff.errol's a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing. they pool their resources and get michele morgan to impersonate errol's daughter who's over in switzerland with her mother. the idea being to snag a rich bankroll in the hopes rescuing the family fortune. only michele starts looking at another.it's a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals, but rko invested this film with a good cast of players. barbara hale and elizabeth risdon play another débutante and her mother who suspect something's not right, victor borge is a fortune seeking no account, dooley wilson, paul hartman, grace hartman, marcy mcguire, mel torme and mary wickes, play others of the errol household staff. not a bad bunch at all.sinatra sang three good ballads all of them had some kind of commercial success, the music stopped, a lovely way to spend an evening, and i couldn't sleep a wink last night. the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song, but lost to alice faye's you'll never know.1943 was the year of the musician's union strike against the recording industry. to get their material out, frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an acapella chorus for columbia. bing crosby recorded songs from his film dixie in the same manner for decca. both of them were denounced by the president of the union, james c. petrillo as strikebreakers and both did not cross the picket line again. the strike wasn't settle completely until 1944 although decca broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia, rca victor and the others.the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra. he had just left the tommy dorsey orchestra when the strike was called. it closed off a needed venue for his artistry when he wasn't sure whether leaving dorsey would prove to be a right career move. fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched.

saying a film is depressing isn't necessarily a bad thing. i'm very willing to watch a depressing film if there is a point to be made and this one certainly has one. it's the often heartbreaking story of a chinese man and his family as they experience many years of both hardship and plenty. but, i must warn you that this might just be about the most depressing film to come out of hollywood in the 1930s--because peasant life in china was tough to say the least. be prepared to watch segments about famine, death and disease.about the only negative other than the persistent tone of misery is that the lead is played by paul muni. while he was an exceptionally talented man, it's just a real shame that hollywood always cast people of european descent to play asian leads during this era. if you are paying attention at all, it's pretty obvious that muni is wrong for the part.

the good earth is a great movie!!!everybody must see...it is tear-jerking and very heart warming. it caters to the enhancement of values-formation on perseverance, humility and the love of family...the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold. the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such, he may be left defenseless and useless. i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors...their emotions has captivated the audience. the movie may have been done in black and white, but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end. that makes it really great! there should be a re-make for this very nice movie.

this timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. so many years have i waited to see this eternal story! i was not ready, perhaps. it is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power. so i now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness.my respect and admiration for paul muni has been long. his is now a legendary luminescence. but now i have finally discovered the priceless gifts of luise rainer's splendid talents. oh, how many faces can speak as did hers? some have said that it was wrought from her silent years, and this well might have been but her speech, is eloquent enough when it is given a chance. she amply deserved her oscar.this movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions. all parts equal, necessary and perfect. naysayers may walk away if they wish, but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime.the good earth enriches one in ways that one does not expect. but all will not come from it with the joy that i did. but i can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years.do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players. these are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection. but i dare a million score of newer films to tell pearl buck's story with such poignancy, power, conviction and grace.if any modern artist would dare to re-film this masterpiece, i warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling. time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness.

this adaptation of pearl s. buck's film is certainly a classic. a true hollywood epic, it has all the things a great hollywood film has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair, and so on. there is only one thing that irks me. i know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors. paul muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as wang lung, the owner of a farm in china. luise rainier plays olan. she does not even look chinese! i think she tried to get the role, but they should have put anna may wong in the role. i know why they didn't, and ms. rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". stillm its a great film, especially if you read the book (i did in high school, decades ago). its a must see, just look beyond the casting. i think you can.

pearl s.buck was a brilliant author that was a first american lady won nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with enrico fermi an italian physit.she wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel (east wind and west wind) in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels.she won in 1935 (pulitzer prize) in literature on her eternal novel (the good earth) which made a brilliant panorama on the life of chinese peasant (wung lung) and his wife (o-lane) and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders.paul muni succeeded in this role as chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with chinese people in san francisco in their town to be chinese exactly as a real and true.shara reiner succeeded in her role as (o-lane) by this brilliant evidence that she won an academy awarded as a best actress in 1937.

the quote i used for my summary occurs about halfway through the good earth, as a captain of a chinese revolutionary army (played by philip ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot more of the looters among them, as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. of course, the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave girl o-lan (for whose portrayal luise rainer, now 99-years-old, won her second consecutive best actress oscar).the next scene finds o-lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband, farmer wang lung (paul muni), setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline.for a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, starvation, home invasion, eating family pets, mental retardation, infanticide, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, summary mass street executions, bigamy, child-beating, adultery, incest, and insect plagues of biblical proportions, the good earth is a surprisingly heart-warming movie.my parting thought is in the form of another classic quote, from o-lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband wang lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): "meat is meat."

1st watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (dir-sidney franklin): well told account of farmers in china and their rise to prominence and struggles with what mother nature throws at them. this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl. the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni. it chronicles , wong long(the character played by muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started. the relationship between him and his wife, played by luise rainer, is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself) and despite the obvious non-chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people. it's obvious that mgm used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it. the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year. the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it's pulled off pretty well.

i first read pearl s buck's splendid novel in my ninth grade history class, and i enjoyed every thrilling page of it. it was almost inevitable that hollywood would get hold of it, and considering that it was made in 1937, the results are excellent.certain things have to be accepted: in 1937 there was no question of casting asian actors in a major hollywood film. in a way this renders the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic-looking cast.with that obstacle to overcome, executive producer irving thalberg and director sidney franklin (among others) took the trouble to hand-pick a splendid and stellar cast. paul muni plays wang lung. muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period, and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to. once you get past the makeup (it's good, but no one is going to really mistake him for a chinese man), his performance has all the verisimilitude of his best work.then there is luise rainer. coming off an oscar win the previous year for her performance in the great ziegfeld, the viennese actress's star was on the rise and she was given the plum role of o-lan despite her lack of experience in hollywood. her performance won her a second consecutive oscar, the first time in history that happened.much criticism has been leveled at rainer's performance, and her oscar win here. she has been called wooden and one-note. there is a small grain of truth in that. however, that being said, all you need to do is go back to the book. for rainer, though not chinese, played o-lan pretty much as buck wrote her; it is in fact a splendid performance, and one of the best transfers from book to screen i have ever witnessed.as for the rest of the cast, well this was mgm. they had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in hollywood at the time, and a big budget to pay for the best, and in the end they got the best.the film softens wang lung's marriage to o-lan somewhat. in the novel, with wealth come the lusts of the flesh and he takes on a concubine, a move which devastates his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him. in the film, a contrite wang lung returns to his wife on her deathbed the two pearls he had taken from her years before, realizing too late that she was his true love.corny, yes. but that's hollywood. considering the obstacles they were up against, the film might well have opened to screams of laughter. but despite the noticeable dearth of real asians in the cast, this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of seventy-three years. in fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is, when it might so easily have been a disaster.

this film was an interesting take by hollywood on the novel by of the same name by pearl s. buck. while some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. i found that the white actors playing chinese was not as bad as i expected, that it wasn't the asian equivalent of blackface. back then there were not really any asian actors in america (not even george takei was acting) and rainer did a good job with her part. it wasn't the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.the film had some parallels to the john ford style, but i think the eastern influence affected it as well. if this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. however here he learns his lesson, then wins.

my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. other then that, it's pretty good. paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. luise rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni. they live with muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad. when he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first. when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before. they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it. when a bunch of people start looting the town, the military show up and start executing people . paul muni does a good job and luise rainer won a second oscar for this movie.

sidney franklin's "the good earth" has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially from luis ranier, who won an oscar for her portrayal of o-lan. rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable. having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), rainer relies instead on facial and body language. she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.the film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. when lung and wife o-lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning. it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch) that they again find fulfillment. a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. money isn't worth anything without friends and family, a point that the film drives home perfectly in it's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion.

faithful to the work of pearl s. buck whose years spent in china as a child of missionary parents that provided her with deep insights into the chinese culture and its philosophy, this film adaptation is brilliantly done, both in technically artistry and acting.wang lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life: to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to olan, a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area. despite wang lung and olan's best efforts to farm the land, raise kids, and build savings and wealth, a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for. choosing not to sell their land, a traditional asian belief, they instead journey to a major city to wait out the famine. while in the city, they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families. although not a looter, olan gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man's house. she's summarily rounded up for execution by the army, but is saved at the last minute. her good fortune, however, is that she found valuable jewels at the looting site that affords her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again. the newly found wealth transforms wang lung. he becomes selfish, self-centered and takes credit for the find. he becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more unappreciative, arrogant and difficult to reason with. he loses touch with the basic things in life that money can't buy: loyalty, commitment, trust, fairness and honesty. as punishment, nature once again turns the table on wang lung by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has. brought to his knees, wang lung enlists the aid of all friends, former friends, workers, and family. with all that help, he succeeds in saving the farm. from that experience, he once again returns to humbleness and an appreciation for the basics in life.

this film was released the year i was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. i watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. while it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb. pearl s. buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of luise rainer and paul muni. the novel which earned ms. buck the nobel prize for literature comes alive under the baton of sydney franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the story of peasant farmer, wang lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. in buck's story, wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. in the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. the german-born luise rainer brings a tentative but determined peasant chinese woman to life in her portrayal of olan. muni likewise captures the naive but honorable wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. other classic characters include charlie grapewin, dorothy gale's kansan uncle henry from the wizard of oz, walter connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and keye luke as number one son-- but this time, not charlie chan's.a classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. if that's indeed the case, this film is a classic, no doubt whatsoever.

from the upper shelf of great classic books, comes this masterful story written by pearl buck. the book like the movie is called " the good earth." it relates the story of wang lung (paul muni) a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'great house' where he has taken a slave woman called o-lan (luise rainer) and made her his wife. almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. during the following years, o-lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's toil, troubles and changing fortunes. through the passing years, they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine. indeed, it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship, loyalty and love. with the changing times, their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives, like their uncle (walter connolly) who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but is compassionately tolerated. wang has his 'old father' (charley grapewin) to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature. two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are keye luke who plays wang's elder son and phillip ahn who plays a nationalist soldier. the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. highly recommended for all audiences. ****

"the good earth" is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore. there are a lot of big disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. all of this happens in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards. the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role. she basically only has three emotions: submissive, hungry, and heart-broken.the performances by the asian and asian-american actors are terrific.

this is where the term "classic film" comes from. this is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (yeah right, a pearl!!) luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in "the great zigfield". it really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. but in "good earth" she shows that she can really act! her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. people say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. like hell. her character olan is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength. she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. if you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are not looking!paul muni shows that he can act as well. his character is not a likeable one to me. he never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. the greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl.if you get a chance to see this film, watch it. you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created.

what irving thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again. making a chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of paul muni, luise rainer, charley grapewin, and walter connolly among others.perhaps it's partly because the story was written by a westerner, pearl buck who got a pulitzer prize for her novel in 1932. ms. buck, daughter of chinese missionaries, probably brought china closer to the consciousness of america than any other person. not the political struggles of china, but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in the good earth. unfortunately later on, pearl buck became an apologist for the kuomintang china of chiang kai-shek in all its virtues and excesses. the rest of her literary output never matched the good earth.in the sundowners there is a great description of comparing china to australia by peter ustinov. when asked the difference, ustinov said china was very big and very full and australia was very big and very empty. that's what you see in the good earth, china very big and very full of people, more than she can deal with at times.the good earth tells the story of wang lung (paul muni) as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave. the woman o-lan (luise rainer) bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have, drought, famine, revolution, and a climatic locust plague.luise rainer won the second of two consecutive oscars for portraying o-lan. she may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player oscar performance with the least amount of dialog. everything she does practically is done with facial expressions, her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles. i think only john mills in ryan's daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man.muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture. rainer helps in the field, bears and raises the kids, does the housework. when muni becomes a man of property he takes a chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief. still rainer stoically bears it all. still muni is not a bad man and it's a tribute to the film and his acting and buck's writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged. we've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just kung fu movies. i'm surprised the good earth of all films has not been remade at this point. i'll bet the chinese government would even let some american company do it on an actual location.till then we've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.

i watched this movie with some curiosity. i wanted to see if 1) paul muni could play chinese and 2) luise rainer deserved her oscar. i came away from the film thinking yes! having seen muni in only one film where he was quite hammy, i expected the same type of performance here. i was happily proved wrong. although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the hollywood idea of asians, i thought he was just right in the role. keye luke, if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role, might have played him in much the same manner.i was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the sacking of the palace where o-lan was once a slave. the graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter. i watched this film from beginning to end enthralled. i can't say the same for the "epics" of today.

this is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it. in other words, a lot of ground to cover.it was soap-operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments, too, capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film. that was astounding to view. considering this film is about 70 years old, the special-effects crew on this film did a spectacular job.paul muni and luise rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here, both giving powerful performances. the only problem is credibility as all the asians are played by caucasions and some of them, like walter connolly, just don't look real. i'd like to see a re-make of this movie with all-asian actors, not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible.

sure, 65 years have passed since thalberg's last production was filmed. but fellow imdb members, come on, this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30's! it is a 10.this was the first movie i saw at new york's museum of modern art, around 1970 (i was a teenager). expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often thrilling, and always engaging, to me it was mgm movie-making at its best. what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack, the person by person destruction of a mansion, the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth.last week, those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the "senior" oscar winner in attendance, luise rainer. how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful, haunting performances in history electing to return for a celebration.ok, so she should not have won the year before (great ziegfeld), but don't blame luise. talkies were only a decade old when this was released, and her dialogue limited. but as olan, her use of visual and vocal is memorable.large scale and touching, what more could a movie lover want!

let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non-asian actors playing asian roles. the movie is 67 years old. in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could/should be able to play any role. actors were under contracts, and did not always have a choice about what role they played. end of story.this is a truly great epic story of love, individual rights, class strata, and men/women issues. the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni. muni plays wang, a chinese farmer, who is about to take a wife (rainer). from the start, he treats her with respect, during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help. without giving too much of the movie away, they go through the highs and lows of all relationships, and even though the story may take place in late 19th/early 20th century,the story and much of their feelings, seems credible.other than the fact that the movie is about 5-10 minutes longer than it needs to be, and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters, this is a really wonderful movie that, unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness.9 out of 10

this may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.the story revolves around iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley. iris discovers that stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...jane fonda competently plays iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. however, robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. they aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.i won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.

set in world depression era prague, this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has exchanged romantic letters, only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop, who seems to be constantly bickering with the colleague. add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -stewart- is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable.although very dated (references to poverty and -i have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out-of-reach for common people's enjoyment), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make "you've got mail". in the re-make starring tom hanks and meg ryan, the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended."shop around the corner" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's utopia. lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture!

would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement. margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other. this movie sports what i think is frank morgan's most winning performance, and with "the wizard of oz" and "tortilla flat" under his belt, that is saying a lot. the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. director ernst lubitsch might have thought "trouble in paradise" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph. with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the 30's has to offer.

i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laserdiscs from ebay. usually, i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies.if you are bored by today's special fx films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening. what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. there is nothing fake or pretentious about them. take mr. matuschek for example: when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself. not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of stewart. (ok, weired example.) yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. yet still, i liked it a lot. if you likes notting hill then you will like shop around the corner. in fact, hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart.

a warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (james stewart and margaret sullavan) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it. the key to this film's success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key, unfussy performances. as a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them.there's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated. loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by frank morgan. he discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it. this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met. of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy.lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well.this is a wonderful, unsung romance.grade: a+

i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. however, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. you think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. but, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.

so much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can i add? just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed. it is christmas eve and frank morgan's character (the owner of the shop - mr. matuschek)is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner. each and everyone of them politely turn him down. they all have plans for their own christmas eve. at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene. frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene. the new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene. desperately mr. matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!the chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as mr. matuschek and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal. every time i see this scene it moves me. if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr. matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film- the talented ernst lubitsch. this film is a joy from beginning to end.

'the shop around the corner (1940)' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. by 1940, director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm, and his famed "lubitsch touch" had become a sparkling commercial trademark. this film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming. rather than substituting either of his main stars, lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing greta garbo in 'ninotchka (1939).' when it was finally completed, 'the shop around the corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role. time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high-profile remakes including 'in the good old summertime (1949)' and 'you've got mail (1998).'at its surface, one might assume 'the shop around the corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, klara novak (sullavan) and alfred kralik (stewart), who love each other without knowing it. however, lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. it's the story of matuschek and company, a stylish gift shop in budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family. when store-owner hugo matuschek (frank morgan) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work. there's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states  perhaps in the blustery streets of new york  but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep. this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film  in fact, even as i write this review, i'm beginning to appreciate the story even more.sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but i think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film. each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable. i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two-dimensional portrayal. matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy (charles smith). this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder's later creations, for example, boom boom jackson in 'the fortune cookie (1966)' or carlo carlucci in 'avanti! (1972).' of course, it doesn't really need saying, but billy wilder learned from the best.

in budapest, margaret sullavan (as klara novak) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop; there, she bickers with co-worker james stewart (as alfred kralik). the two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal. watching ernst lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. even better is a sub-plot involving shop owner frank morgan (as hugo matuschek), who suspects his wife is having an affair. hiring a private detective, mr. morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees. morgan, painfully realizing, "she just didn't want to grow old with me," and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old.********* the shop around the corner (1/12/40) ernst lubitsch ~ james stewart, margaret sullavan, frank morgan, joseph schildkraut

the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film, balta street in budapest but it could really be in any place. the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner. the film is not about budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters.alfred kralik and klara novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. hugo matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone. ferencz vadas has a secret affair. ilona novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments. mr pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children. pepi katona 'plays santa claus' to a girl at christmas. you even sense that quiet flora katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone.the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. it moves effortlessly from scene to scene. it is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound. the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. all the acting is magnificent. even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. james stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other perfectly. he was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance. margaret sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. some of her other films are worth catching. as mr matuschek, frank morgan is amazing. his moment of truth is very moving. gold stars all round to the performers.it is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to (the vague re-make 'you've got mail' was dire) but in this case it is true. the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.

two warring shop workers in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box-number aliases. within this simple idea and an everyday setting, lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit, drama, poignancy and irony that never lets up. stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes. although wrongly eclipsed by stewart's big films of 39/40 (destry, philadelphia story, mr smith) this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films.

after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed, i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, the shop around the corner. i was amazed at this movie. it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times. the acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, i wish to urge you to see it today. i'm not against re-makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic. don't miss it, go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today!

has there ever been a movie more charming than this? one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. the center of it is the "romance" of james stewart and margaret sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including "you've got mail", the recent update of "shop") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with. a must see! **** out of ****

every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production. i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. everyone involved is perfect; script, acting, direction, sets and editing. whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance, and the supporting cast are magnificent, it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was. her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve. lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best. watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking.

the shop around the corner is one of the sweetest and most feel-good romantic comedies ever made. there's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words. it's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end. in fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot. it's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, *could* happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart-warming they may be. alfred kralik (james stewart) and clara novak (margaret sullavan) don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop (matuschek & co.) he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job. they clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened--he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired. their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both (unconsciously, of course!) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through po box 237. this would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that the shop around the corner is expertly fleshed-out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely hugo matuschek (frank morgan) himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; pirovitch (felix bressart), kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp-du-jour vadas (joseph schildkraut) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous kralik; and ambitious errand boy pepi katona (william tracy) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for matuschek & co. the unpretentious love story between 'dear friends' is played out in this little shop in budapest, hungary, in which kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along. it's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well-developed, and matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one alfred and clara share. his invitation to new errand boy rudy (charles smith) for christmas eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell. aside from the love story, i must say that james stewart is truly one of the best things about this film. he doesn't play the full-fledged jimmy stewart persona in this film (c/f 'mr smith goes to washington' for that); in fact alfred kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind. he's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint (until, perhaps, the very end) of the aw-shucks down-home boyish charm stewart would soon come to patent. when he finds out before clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, kralik doesn't 'fess up--he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises (given his stormy relationship with clara as boss and underling) that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself. his description to clara of the fictional matthias popkin (what a name!) who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her. stewart plays this role perfectly--he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever clara insults mr. kralik, as she is often wont to do, even (and especially) to his face. and yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he *could* reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer *hope* as he eventually does. special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well. margaret sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing-shop scene on christmas eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart. frank morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous hugo matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'. and felix bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal pirovitch wonderfully (a lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious russian ambassador in ninotchka)--of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend alfred get the christmas present the latter *really* wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box clara is so hung up on. ernst lubitsch really does himself proud with this film--for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on. but even though lubitsch chose to have the story set in hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you. therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really *are* people. the snow on christmas eve is real as well, or at least as real as lubitsch could make it (he had snow machines brought in at great expense). it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated. (no, not even in a remake like you've got mail.) *this* is really the jimmy stewart christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about it's a wonderful life. not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching the shop around the corner this christmas instead. it's sweet, funny, charming, and stewart is impeccable in his role. we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could.

"the shop around the corner" is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch. in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart .they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs. in fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore. (the makers of "you've got mail" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find "the shop around the corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. just as good with repeat viewings. enjoy!

james stewart and margaret sullavan play co-workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other, not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet.a very charming romantic comedy, very engagingly played by it's two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast. the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (don't quite know how to explain it) that films today just don't have. this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail, and the original wins in every way.this is mandatory viewing each christmas, i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem.

this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players. it will make you laugh and it will make you cry. the very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time. if you want to see a great movie, this is it. jimmy stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr. matuschek is spellbinding. morgan's diversity of character is nothing short of amazing. william tracy as pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances. felix bressart delivers a fantastic performance as perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with. it is a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances.

back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner. had i been casting the film, the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer. his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing. stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan.margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. but is only this one where neither of them dies. sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york. in fact sullavan's husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then.i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty. stewart in the mortal storm was german, but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out. but if you can accept stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch. the plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don't get along in person. but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut. bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions. he makes himself very scarce.and joseph schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan. you really hate people like that, i've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.

of the three remakes of this plot, i like them all, i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd. there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re-watchable. in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each? of course the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also superb. i particularly like william tracy as pepi. he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in. he appeared in many, but most are not available. as the other comments, i also say - buy this one.

this is a truly classic movie in its story, acting, and film presentation. wonderful actors are replete throughout the whole movie, miss sullivan, and jimmy stewart being the foremost characters. in real life she greatly admired, and liked jimmy, and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles, and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set. the "chemistry" between the two was always apparent, and so warm and enjoyable to behold. she was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality portrayals. the story of these two young people, and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch, and pure magical entertainment. heart warming presentations are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story/movie. i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic, that has a special appeal for all generations. a must see for all!

this, despite not being the original - it began life as a play in central europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed (mgm's own remake with period songs in the good old summertime, the broadway show she loves me, even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of years ago) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat. several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try, for example, removing ugarte, ferrari, renault etc from casablanca and yes you'd still have rick and ilsa and viktor lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below. jimmy stewart and maggie sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of frank morgan, felix bressart, joseph schildkraut and andy hardy's sara haden and this is before we factor in that lubitsch 'touch'. okay, maybe they were a tad more naive, innocent even, in that jurassic age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in-your-face sex, turn back to those days of stories, style, slickness and skill and wallow in great movies like this one. by far the best thing about this technological age is not csi but dvd that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it.

much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at the shop around the corner.ernst lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. with sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator samson raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the lubitsch touch.'although the story is set in budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. the beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great american city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.jimmy stewart & margaret sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.cherubic frank morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold. an accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. additionally, morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable christmas eve.joseph schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him. gentle felix bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to stewart.sara haden graces the small role of a sales clerk. william tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force.in tiny roles, charles halton plays a no-nonsense detective and edwin maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. movie mavens will recognize mary carr & mabel colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as miss sullavan's grandmother & aunt.

calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.the shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-european atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads; i avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example mr. matuschek (frank morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.the 1998 film you've got mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.

i just watched this on turner classic movies last night, for the first time ever seeing it, and i loved it. i like lots of the older films, especially because of the absence of all the filthy language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's films. i also think they were made much better in many (but not all) cases. jimmy stewart is a special favorite of mine. i just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and i enjoyed it thoroughly. if you feel the same way about the older films i don't think you can go wrong with this one. i believe "you've got mail" is a remake(even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film.) of this film. for a relaxing evening with a movie you don't have to be ashamed of if your kids or anyone walks in on your viewing, get this,or catch it on one of the classic movie channels.

sweet romantic drama/comedy about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. you can guess the rest. it's beautifully acted by the entire cast (especially sullavan, stewart and frank morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood, but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest! everything looks so perfect and dream-like. a one of a kind film. don't miss it!

a wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. what really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout. the story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences. most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of world war ii. in fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes. yet funny it is--listen to margaret sullivan's harsh dismissal of jimmy stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend "of poetry and meanness". it's funny, pointed, and sad all at once. a remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made.

this is a movie that gets better each time i see it. there are so many nuanced performances in this. william tracey, as pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. joseph schildkraut as vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. frank morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, mr. matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. i especially liked the performance of felix bressart, as pirovitch. very believable in every facet of his role.the two leads are equally accomplished, with margaret sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though. the movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. mr. stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. just watch stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. he is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. in my estimation, james stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. there is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. at the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. this is one of jimmy stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. i greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of stewart.

the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man-vs.-woman-argue-all-the-time-but-wind up-in love-type of hollywood screwball romance/comedy.i usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm.jimmy stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple. the supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable felix bressart to the villain joseph schildkraut. frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters i've ever seen him do in his career. he takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. that "twist" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. this is a great example of that. in this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. i'll take this over the re-make "you've got mail," any day. no comparison.

i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie - i probably know the entire dialog backwards - yet i am drawn to it time and again.set in hungary, a young jimmy stewart plays the eligible bachelor "kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of margaret sullavan's innocent "klara". kralik secretly becomes klara's pen-friend, and at work together klara confides in kralik about the content of his (kralik's) letters. clearly kralik is besotted with klara - but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the "pen-friend". confused? well you wont be - this story has a sweet, almost sugary ending - but we all know it is the ending we all want.other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role, this time as the shop's owner "hugo matuschek", felix bressart as "pirovitch", kralik's confidant. joseph schildkraut as the womanising arrogant "vadas" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning.finally william tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior "pepi katona".recently re-made as "you've got mail" starring tom hanks & meg ryan for me is not as good as the original - although i suspect younger audiences would disagree.if this film is on in your area over christmas, i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of kleenex handy.

ernst lubitsch's contribution to the american cinema is enormous. his legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with "the shop around the corner". this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of mr. lubitsch's own, and definite version.margaret sullavan and james stewart worked in several films together. their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all. both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in budapest.the reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture. in here, we have the wonderful frank morgan, playing the owner of the shop. also, we see joseph schildkraut, felix bressart, william tracy and charles smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in budapest.that is why these films will live forever!

i enjoyed the story by itself, but the things that i learned about wwi planes & boats, make this movie a must see. the close-ups on the plane & the torpedo boat & how they were used were completely new to me. i heartily recommend.

with very little screen time and money, dan katzir manages to do so much. this movie, in its heart-warming simplicity, touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle. rejuvinated lust

excellent film. i cried when she cried, i loved when they loved , i was frustrated when they were. this film touched my heart. it was a reality check for me since this is reality for me, a 19 year old soldier

touching; well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. a love story with rabin's assassination in the background. worth seeing !

shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage. but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style. dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv, but besides, katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and, this people, far from being simple prominent figures, they speak to us from the heart. katzir's film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live, and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes. it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel, which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers, appears as a close and absolutly human reality, the reality of million people who looking for his place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it. katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force, and these feelings cross our hearts. thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world.

dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel.for anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. instantly, you are drawn in to dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.you can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of dan's desperate, snatched relationship with iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. if you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.

i've watched this movie twice, and i plan to see it again. it is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel. it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. it is really worth watching.

one of the best records of israel's response to the murder of rabin.extremely true and natural, it captured the spirit of the nation.especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of israel's loss and the feeling that we shall overcome.

wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe that i started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce i started watching i couldn't stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even eartha kitt and ruby dee forrest whittaker and james earl jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people don't know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about . i've never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses only looks down on because they were privleged and mixed race , i highly recommend this movie

my family goes back to new orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie i knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. i have cousins obviously black aka african americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. it's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that cane river is all a part of that history. it makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of african heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...and at the same time had i not come out of that history, i probably wouldn't be the successful business woman i am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. the acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that needed to be made. anne rice is incredible and i ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and i'm not. i recommend this movie to everyone. leza

i've bought, " the feast of all saints," and it's not truly a horrible movie, but a lot of things could have been better. it had a lot of historical value, played out by very talented actress/actors, and it's not an everyday occurrence that actors can play out such a role and have it be somewhat believable. there were some parts that were a little mediocre and confusing, but i wouldn't say that the entire movie was horrible. once you think about that, capturing 1800's new orleans, and making something out of it, it pretty hard, and much harder to get actors who can strongly signify those parts. but the only big problem i had with the movie was that most of the actors who did play the free people of color, were mostly light skinned africans, not very universal in casting others who weren't light skinned; one of the old creole stereotypes that still exists. whomever did the casting could have picked a wider variety when it came to hue, despite many creoles are color conscious.rather picking actors that looked near white in a sense, could have been more thought out.the actors did a great job, the script could have better written, and overall i found the performances were very believable.

historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans. starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe, anna bella, and marcel.

i am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. fortunately, i was wrong! the screenplay was very close to the novel (i guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)the cast is outstanding. i can't describe how much i enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from ossie davis and ruby dee to robert ri'chard and bianca lawson).the location setting... i was expecting to see the homes and cottages i imagined in my mind: what i saw on screen was slightly different. however, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini-series.i recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars!

i know that originally, this film was not a box office hit, but in light of recent hollywood releases (most of which have been decidedly formula-ridden, plot less, pointless, "save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter-what" drivel), feast of all saints, certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion. the film--like the book--loses anchoring in some of the historical background, but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement, and some of its tragic (and funny, and touching) consequences.and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert ri'chard, cast as the leading figure, marcel, whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his 'coming of age,' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana, at the apex of the antebellum period. when i saw the previews featuring the (dreaded) blond-haired ri'chard, i expected a buffoon, a fop, a caricature--i was pleasantly surprised.ossie davis, ruby dee, the late ben vereen, pam grier, victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage, voodoo, creole "aristocracy," and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion, hate, love, family, and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us.

this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware. my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves. he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight; raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929; providing the family with food whenever she could. of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication. my daughter was fascinated by the movie. we have made it a part of our library.

we tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. it lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves.some of these children just became more slaves, and others were free...but free and coloured, which back then meant anything but, relative to the lot of their sires.a class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able, to a certain extent, to own property, raise themselves from downtrodden to educated, and to attain a comparative dignity. that is to say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent.often, the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth, set up in their own houses, with allowances, schooling paid for for their children, and a kind of gentility, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families. in essence, they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called plaçage.feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched on their lives, in both a negative and a positive way. the tale was an eye-opener for me, a new zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly.the characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by anne rice. the parts are well-cast, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn out, with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through. the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic ones, couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on.i recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, unreservedly. if you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and cower through some parts, as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour, both by their white oppressors, and by their own people. bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality, and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it.i know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. watch it. if not read up on the period, because there's a lesson to be learned from it all.

although not one of vonnegut's better known works, it is a definite "must-see". interestingly thought out, i especially like how the director filmed the couple in love.

i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story. the acting by nolte, lee, arkin and the supporting cast was superb. the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details.

vonnegut's words are best experienced on paper. the tales he weaves are gossemar, silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions. his words have been treated well once before, in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5.mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island, along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeard.the film version deserves a 10, but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just can't do it...some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory...

i am a huge fan of vonnegut's work and i'm very fond of this movie, but i wouldn't say that this is a film of the "mother night" that i read. when people say that vonnegut is unfilmable, two things come to my mind. one is that many of his themes are very near the knuckle or even taboo, despite the accusation sometimes used against him that he chooses relatively "easy" targets for his satire. this means less every day that passes as far as filmability is concerned. directors these days appear to revel in breaking taboos and i have high hopes for the version of "bluebeard" now in production. amazing to think that an innocent piece like vonnegut's "sirens of titan" would probably have been the equivalent of "r" rated if filmed when it was published back in the 50s, for its violence, language and sexual and thematic content, though it's a tragedy that nobody's come up yet with a filmable script for it. and in the present economic climate, i also hope some director out there is looking closely at "jailbird", "galapagos" and "hocus pocus".the other thing is his narrative style, heaping irony upon irony upon irony but still making it hilariously funny. it seems impossible to objectify, and that appears to be the biggest obstacle to making great films of his great novels, because the little authorial comments that colour our response as readers are just not possible in movies without resorting to too often clumsy techniques like "talkovers". vonnegut suggested that there was a character missing from filmed versions of his work, himself as author/narrator. to its credit, "breakfast of champions" (the movie) tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a cropper for its pains. as did another turkey made from a vonnegut novel, "slapstick" in an even more spectacular way.still, there's nothing wrong with a director giving us his subjective interpretation of vonnegut, and "mother night" is an excellent example of how, as another reviewer put it, a good director can add a visual poetry to a source like this. but so much of the humour is lost that though it's the same plot, it's not really from the same novel i read. if it had been, i'd probably have been rolling in the aisles laughing a few times watching it. for a reader of the novel, i think a chuckle even at the end is forgivable. the end of the film, however, is truly poignant, and i think one of the film's successes is that it can genuinely leave you feeling that you've watched someone walk a razor's edge between good and evil, and the jury is still out.standing alone and of itself it's well worth a look. technically there are some minor but glaring errors, notably in continuity, and it too often looks drab and theatrical, but most of the time it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagination and resourcefulness. the acting in general is of a high order, even if maybe the dialogue is by today's standards a little stilted.it survives quite well watching back to back with "slaughterhouse-5", and there is actually quite a bit more "good" filmed vonnegut out there, mostly versions of his short stories - "harrison bergeron", "who am i this time?" and some other things like, of course, the misfiring filmed version of his very funny but disposable play, "happy birthday wanda june". also there was an interesting piece , if it still exists, done in the 70s called "between time and timbuktu" which vonnegut apparently didn't like much, although he was involved in its production, because he felt it misinterpreted him in its generality. he said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments performed in the hg wells tale "the island of dr. moreau", but it did for many people serve as an excellent introduction to his work.but if the films don't make you want to go to the superior source material, they're not doing their job.as the man said, more or less, the big show is inside your head.

it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. once you get past the bar, it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good.nolte, an american, moves to germany, marries a famous actress, and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out. he's visited by a jovial american, john goodman, who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis. nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself. another american secret agent will modify nolte's radio scripts -- inserting a cough here, a sneeze there -- that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies. there's a catch, though. nobody will know about nolte's real role as an american agent except goodman, donovan, and roosevelt himself. if he's ever uncovered, he'll be refused recognition by the americans.nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany. his adored wife, sheryl lee, knows nothing of what's going on, nor does she care. nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "a nation of two." the war ends and the trouble begins. he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. they beat him and leave him in the mud. he's rescued by goodman, his "fairy godmother", who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then.by 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter alan arkin, who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists -- led by a dentist and a priest. his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. he's beaten senseless by an ex-gi. but -- miraculously -- his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans. another catch: it turns out later that it's not his wife, but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence.the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. it's not a happy ending.nolte can talk with, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his in jail. it's adolf eichmann. eichmann seems pleasant enough. he advises nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours. "it's important to relax. you must learn to relax." nolte laughs out loud and shouts, "that's how i got here." the film is filled with such ironies. at one point in their relaxed conversations, arkin tells him that "in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart." i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't, that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater-goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary.the fact is that it's a movie for adults, and patient adults at that. the story moves slowly, there's very little violence, no car chases, no shootings, and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure. a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach. nolte refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two." this is a pretty compact phrase. no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import.it's a story of a man who loses everything -- his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his sole friend, his country, his self respect. at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark, when he is moved along by a curious cop. the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression. i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth. adolescents might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot, but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.remember robert frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in? well no place will take nolte in.

i have not read the novel, or anything other by kurt vonnegut, but i am now intending to start. this grips you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits start rolling. taking you places you don't expect, the plot is interesting throughout. the pacing is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen. it is well-told and well-thought out. i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to. it is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. the acting is excellent, nolte absolutely shines, goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs, and lee and arkin are spellbinding. i could go on, really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and all of the visuals are great, with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones. i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. there is one scene of sexuality, and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this. i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10

i haven't yet read kurt vonnegut's mother night (though i've read other books of his, all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces). after seeing keith gordon's film adaptation of his book, it will be an immediate must-read in the near future. it's the kind of material that i'm sure if it wasn't made in 1995/96 as a film, it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-holocaust/ww2 movies are quite popular. except that this is much darker, though even more resonant, about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader. it's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime, which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about.it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for howard w. cambpell (nick nolte), which is does. but it's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique. keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material (more-so i think back to him as an actor, oddly enough featured briefly with vonnegut himself in back to school), but this is a revelation. he takes the story of campbell as a story of a fractured life: a german propaganda master (the "only american left in berlin"), who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed, and was before a playwright who really belonged to "a nation of two", himself and his wife (sheryl lee). it follows him from his prison cell, awaiting trial in israel in 1961, as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend' nazi, and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a new york apartment, which is where the bulk of the film takes place.mother night can be quite heavy, like on a level one might associate with the pianist, but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film. gordon, by way of vonnegut, is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing, except the memory (and then later a weird transposition) of his long lost love in a "sister" who has come back to him in nyc, so he's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter (alan arkin, very very good here), and then is found out as a nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter, leading wackos to his apartment. on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story, but not a thing is straightforward. the 'something' of this man's life is staggering, but it's ultimately of his own choosing. campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end, but the same conclusions might be reached (and, in a way, mirrors the line goebbels said): the bigger the lie, the more people believe it. that is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power.but oh, it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale, or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances (which is does: nolte is at his very best here, and sheryl lee, who we might remember from twin peaks as laura palmer, stuns in multiple roles, especially in the scene when she reveals she's not 'really' helga). it's also a gorgeously shot film, with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character, or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time (watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant, the juxtaposition of faces is great). and the music selections rise the level of tragedy. it could be argued some of the music is too much, but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic, solemn about human nature.it's not always an easy film to take emotionally, and some of the twists do have that tinge of "whoa" as in any spy story. but it's the subversion from vonnegut that sticks through, the way of taking appearance and performance, of life imitating art imitating life imitating death, and making it into something worth remembering. i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film (or the other way around), but at the moment it's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2/holocaust storytelling.

i have just recently read the novel "mother night", i've owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often. few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has, i am amazed at the brilliance not only of vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen.do not rent or watch this movie on vhs, it must be done on dvd, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. to see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, i think any viewer will be amazed.the omissions in the movie are few from the text, and do not detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation i have ever seen. i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it.it will change you if you do.

the movie is a bit "thin" after reading the book, but it's still one of the greatest movies ever made. sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really "vonneguty". he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film. not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does.

i've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film, and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film, like mann's the insider, is completely subjective. it's from howard's pov. so, any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it, as ebert did, is really about nolte's character actually. if you feel, as he did, that the film "does not work", then you're saying, i think, that howard does not work. and, to be frank, you might be right. howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis.but, hey, that's the nature of people.andrew.

nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut's dark tale. notle plays howard w. campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii. after the war, he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past. as with much of vonnegut's work, this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims. nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger campbell, and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)

i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like. however, this being said, he's made a lot of films and i've seen just a few. in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in "the thin red line". nolte has a a full range of acting talents. when it's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion. his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors: when he just emotes through facial, hand and body gestures, without saying anything. having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors, by and large, have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin, this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers. of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in. had chaplin lived in our times....who knows, he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools.i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen. however, the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid, even with all its surprises. of course on the outset it appears preposterous. however, it is also not impossible.consider these for starters: a spy at the heart of the third reich: he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe, america's most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard (look at amazon for more details). consider: history undercover: piercing the reich: american spies inside nazi germany dvd (i saw this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a history channel production.so, is the story ridiculous? far fetched yes, impossible, no. back to the plot. nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts. was it a type of passivity, that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part? that's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp. but, it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things.the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role.i was really shocked by the ending of the film (no - i won't spoil it) and it made me feel terrible about the choice. did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? hard to say but it really jolts.nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect....the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things. it's very entertaining and provoking. what great movies should be. a bit long but worth it. by the way, the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers: arvo part.

although i like kurt vonnegut, i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one. the only reason i watched it was nick nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since i saw "breakfast of champions" and "hotel rwanda". but the film brought me a pleasant surprise. of course nolte was great, but so was the plot. there was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans (and, as it later turns out, americans) towards jews or hitler. which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. howard campbell jr. (nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. there are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song white christmas), that make it real different from average american movies. i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies.

american playwright howard w. campbell, jr. (played with a musty obsolescence by nick nolte) lives happily in germany with his actress wife, helga noth (sheryl lee) before the beginning of world war ii. at the peak of his life, howard is drafted by an american agent (john goodman) to become a spy on behalf of the allies; forewarned of the risks the job holds, howard has everything to lose, but finds the offer irresistible. following the death of his wife and the end of the war, campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in new york city, which muddies his neuroses even further. the central question (indeed, a question that has frustrated many critics) of the movie and kurt vonnegut's source novel is, "is campbell a hero or a traitor?" director keith gordon and screenwriter robert b. weide offer us clues, but no answer, and this ambiguitythis not knowingis what keeps "mother night" fresh and interesting throughout. at the beginning of the film, nolte portrays campbell as intelligent and confident; by the end, he's either scared and uncertain, or scared and completely certain of his contribution/debt to humanity for the role he played in the war. gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film's first half, which complement his portrait of the nazi bourgeoisie and captures vonnegut's dramatic side. on the flip side, when campbell is confined to his lonely new york apartment (which he affectionately calls "purgatory") only to be discovered by a group of nazis, the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author, and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds. the moral (even spiritual) paradox "mother night" presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution, and to a degree, should be left ambiguousthe black-and-white scenes of campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about; the war changes him, coming back to america changes him, and meeting up with the nazis in new york compels him to prolong the facade of his "act" even further, to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall, spewing anti-semitic bile. perhaps that's the best reaction we could hope for.

if you've read mother night and enjoyed it so much (as i did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. does this mean that the movie misses the mark? of course not. in my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. i've seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. i would not place this movie as one of the best i've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. by taking vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, mother night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.

while the movie does feel a bit long at times, it is well worth it. gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles. merciless, thoughtful, ironic, quirky, and dark, this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while, begging for answers to impossible questions. nolte, goodman, and arkin are all incredible. sheryl lee is wonderful as well, in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura/maddy days. do not miss this one!

mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment. instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut's novel.this is certainly nolte's best preformance to date. he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes.alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft. sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell's young lover. john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell's "blue fairy godmother."this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. and aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across. cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish. and he realizes that...well, watch the movie and you'll see.mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.

before this, the flawed "slaughterhouse five" was the best. but this screen adaptation of "mother night" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. thankfully it wasn't hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of "breakfast of champions." another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as i think you do for slaughterhouse five). that's probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! nick nolte did an excellent job in this film.

hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. the "indie" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it. these days, i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses. and normally that is too bad, but not in this case. mother night has tight direction and a solid cast. nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that "everyman" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always. i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. i guess making your debut as a dead girl (twin peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon. anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. in fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (i am talking to you, fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).

there are numerous films relating to ww2, but mother night is quite distinctive among them: in this film, we are introduced to howard campbell (nolte), an american living in berlin and married to a german, helga noth (lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: more specifically, a cia agent major wirtanen (goodman) recruits campbell who becomes a nazi propagandist in order to enter the highest echelons of the hitler regime. however, the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge campbell's role in the war for national security reasons, and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us. after the war, he tries to conceal his identity, but the past comes back and haunts him. his only "friend" is wirtanen, but even he cannot do much for the avalanche of events that fall upon poor campbell...the story is deeply touching, as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great patriot, is treated by disdain by everybody who surrounds him. not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him, have many secrets of their own. vonnegut provides us with a moving atmosphere, with campbell's despair building up and almost choking the viewer.nolte plays the role of his life, in my opinion; he is even better than in "affliction", although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self-destruction. sheryl lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole cast in general.i haven't read the book, so i cannot appraise how the film compares to it. in any case, this is something of no importance here: my critique is upon the film per se, and the film wholeheartedly deserves a 9/10.

at first, i hadn't read the novel so far and i hadn't hear anything about the author yet. but as i casually saw this movie, i was totally captive by the story. already as the jewish watchman primary said, that he knows no one, who have a bad conscience about the war except from howard w. campbell junior, was such amazing objective and dissociates from simply moralizing the war. terrific! and the fictitious story about "the most effective spy for the usa in wwii", who have lost everything, that was important for his life, is wonderful emotional transcribed. this is the best story about the duality of humanity, i've ever heard about! the questions, this movie is introducing, are in my opinion very important for our society: when does someone bear the guilt of something? what is guilt? who is a hero and who is a felon? what is important in our life? can you live without paying attention to the political changes? is the protagonist guilty or not? these questions are more up to date than in the last 60 years. this is a must see for everyone, who have to think about the acception of war! this movie is a must see for everyone, who meditate, what matters in life and what doesn't...

i haven't yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from, but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. overall, i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut's novels. it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us. his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi's and send secret messages to the american's via his weekly radio show. but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york, where various odd plot twists await.if mother night has a problem it's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times. but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb. and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell. very much recommended.

this is a very chilling, and for the most part, a well thought out drama. i am very impressed at the film, not just for the plot and superb acting, but that such a unique movie was made. most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle, but not this. this isn't about this kind of war, its about the war between a man and his position in life, an american spy in germany, posing as a supporter of an evil no one will ever forget. when the war is over, campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. going back to america, campell meets nazi supporters as well as nazi haters, providing for interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. nolte more than pulls off the role, and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking.

i haven't read this book, but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head: this is so vonnegut. i have never seen an author, all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well to film. this movie had the same complexities found in vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes.campbell was also a very vonnegut character, portrayed perfectly by nick nolte. he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut "hero": lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress, and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him.overall, i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie. it was the same feeling i had reading "cat's cradle," my first vonnegut novel, as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen, he thought of that, and he made it real and important. yes, he has nothing but army surplus "white christmas" albums. so it goes!

the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published. nolte takes the role of howard w. campbell, jr., and makes it his own, remaining true to vonnegut's depiction of a man who has lost all (to and) for love.no weaknesses in this fine adaptation.

this movie pleasantly surprised me. it has a touching, slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention. this is a movie i never heard about, but if you want a "sleeper", this is it. great writing, production, and acting. i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful. nick nolte, sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous. why wasn't more made of this movie?

it's so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves, but not by much. as a long-time student of vonnegut's works, i have no hesitation in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those that love him as i do. the casting is inspired: nolte is understated in triumph, bewildered in defeat, decisive in judgment. sheryl lee is luscious throughout, but her handling of the treacherous resi and her tragic crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty. alan arkin delivers a totally lovable, but equally treacherous, soviet spy.do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film; though, if you haven't read mother night, you will probably want to after viewing the film.notice the shifts from color to black-and-white and back again, and don't miss the final symbolism of campbell's noose. watch, also, for kurt vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film.bing crosby's "white christmas" will never sound the same (i write in mid-december, when the song is getting heavy radio play, and it's driving me nuts).

i'm a rather pedestrian person, with somewhat lowbrow tastes. however, i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. this movie was one of my attempts. i was in awe throughout the entire movie. i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again. this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. i saw it as a huge question to the viewer: what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept, can be asked to accept, should accept? as a military member, this is of course an important question to me. this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.recommended.

as alan rudolph's "breakfast of champions" slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's "mother night" came out. now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being "unfilmable" it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments (the other being "slaughter-house five"). "mother night" is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why. it's brilliant! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book (without being stilted or overly literary) and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic. how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that? vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? not only is it a beautiful film, it is a beautifully acted, written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s. it's a mournful, inspired, surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected. i would sincerely encourage anyone to see "mother night" - it doesn't even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (as "slaughter-house five" sometimes does). it is a powerful, affecting piece of cinema.

this movie has so many wonderful elements to it! the debut performance of reese witherspoon is, of course, marvelous, but so too is her chemistry with jason london. the score is remarkable, breezy and pure. james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold. he also seems to have a knack for lost-days-of-youth movies, be sure to catch his score for the recent "peter pan" and the haunting gothic music of "the village." i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i don't just cry at the ending, i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia. show this movie to your daughters. it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film.

really...and incredible film that though isn't very popular...extremely touching and almost life altering...was for me at least.definitely worth seeing and buying .....added to my favorite movie list....it's number one now....this is a very touching movie that all people should see..the man in the moon.....we'll it's just incredible. it's now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you're somewhat mature......if you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie....but it really is incredible....just watch it because it'll alter the way some people look at life....worth seeing 5/5

reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. she appears like a fresh scrubbed face "tween" slight and stringy, but undeniably reese.i have always liked her as an actor, and had no idea she started this young with her career, go figure. i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on. i say that because whenever i have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact.anyway, my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland, somehow i assumed that was her first time up "at bat" not so, well done reese

the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's. the main story follows a 14-year old girl (reese witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (jason london) who ends up falling for her older sister (emily warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever. the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. witherspoon already begins to show the oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man. warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland, who plays london's mom. i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase "family ties."

i thought this movie was very well done. taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me. it was well cast and believable. i don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. after the movie was over i wished there was a part two. i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family. this movie is bound to be a classic. if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it...

i thought this was a very good movie. it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off. i'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that's why this made this move such a good movie. it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy, (the same boy) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them. it's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over. i really enjoyed watching this movie, and i still do now when it comes on. i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby, this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died, this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead.

had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel. look, my taste is like any others', eclectic. my favorites run from blue velvet to dr. strangelove to the ghost and mrs. muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one, eraserhead, repo man, and the spy within.the man in the moon is superbly made, a gentle hearted, joyous and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act. this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library. this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting.it's hard to remain stoic during the film's last moments, particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister's heart searing private pain and forgives all.rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose, will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours.if you purchase no other film, please, purchase the man in the moon. this moving story is one you'll enjoy reliving time and again. it is a joy and a gem, a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts.the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold.paul vincent zecchinomanasota key, florida05 april, 2009

i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming. reese witherspoon is so charming and jason london's not so bad either! it is so sweet watching dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching court fall in love with maureen. however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for dani. i must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for dani in the end. it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. i just could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then maureen and dani. they really can make it through anything. i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen.

i checked this out as an impulse when browsing through the movie store and couldn't have been any more pleasantly surprised! my mom and i watched this film together, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. it isn't the typical "chick-flick" with a sappy love story and tears all the way through, but it definitely touches a nerve in the twist at the end. it's an ending where, although unexpected and tragic, the movie's overall effect is not harmed by it. i think reese witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching! i didn't recognize many of the supporting actors, but they all play their important supporting roles well. "the man in the moon" is such an believable story about a young teenager falling in love for the first time. most women can definitely relate to everything-from witherspoon's words, her subtle glances, and her not so subtle emotions (raging like the typical teenage girl). while she's playing a character confused about love, she does not come across as silly and immature, which was much appreciated considering many movies today.

it was life-changing, it really was!!!the man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to watch.the acting was fabulous, the story line was great, and this was a perfect start for reese witherspoon's career.i don't see how anyone couldn't love this film.sure, it's not the best movie ever, even though it was close to it, but it was highly amusing to watch, and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs.of course, there was some cry your heart out moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and it brightens up your day, although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then.i can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award, and i also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site.see this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching.

i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was.i mean at first i was kinda expecting a cheesy, and predictable film, but i decided to put that aside when watching.well, when it was over i was just left stunned(mainly in tears), by how great the man in the moon turned out to be.this movie is so entertaining and is so aware of its tone, and its just a fabulous film.the acting was great especially from reece witherspoon(who was so cute and lovable), and everyone else.there wasn't anything that really bothered me, i felt the ending kinda predictable, but very well done at that.also i felt some things to be plain or as if it had been done before, but still a great film.overall i must say i don't to much to say about this film, not that it was bad, its just a film you either like or don't like.i would however recommend this to any and everyone, even if you don't like these type of films, its still an enjoyable film.8.7 out of 10 stars

reese witherspooon's first movie. loved it. the plot and the acting was top notch. you are emotionally involved with the characters. in my opinion, a must see.after watching this movie you will see why reese witherspoon's acting career has been so successful. the other cast members do a great job also. the movie flows extremely well. there is not a boring moment in the whole picture. the man in the moon's length is just right. as i said earlier, i think this movie was excellent. i have seen it numerous times, and have enjoyed every one of the viewings.

a young man named court is loved by everyone. his painful bloody death brings everyone closer. you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie. whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, this is a moving story, full of milieu and sensuality.one other thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible. but the elements for this are set up subtly. note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field. note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves. he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment. to this day, tractors are pretty dangerous.

this "coming of age" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, dani and maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.directed by robert mulligan, famous for his superb work in "to kill a mockingbird," the film never hits a false note. all the acting is superb. as dani, reese witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, i felt like i was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie.i have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.

i had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed. reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the (small) cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s american setting. the reason i didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit. perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer. maureen's character is quite underdeveloped i think. it is understandable that dani (reese w., the younger) would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset? because she's a few years older? hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film? the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met, when he gets tractored (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit. well it works!). it depends what you want - if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise. man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination? i liked the character of court though, i can see what girls watching this might be watching. and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister (most men would, most films wouldn't) and get killed.7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale. for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny.

there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon. that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed. robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work. every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best.

i watched this movie by chance, get curious by the trailer on tv. i like when i discover movies like this, little, tender stories about ordinary people. even if the end is tragic, "the man in the moon" has some funny moments, especially in the first characterization of dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with court. it's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: the performance of reese witherspoon, who maintained her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography by the "old lion" freddie francis and the fantastic score by james newton howard, which is really the soul of the movie. his themes (which deserved an oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music.

loved the film! this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london, both of which are two of my favorites. must say that no matter how many times i've seen this movie i can't help but tear up. one of those movies that should become a classic for all.

i saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with reese witherspoon's portrayal of dani trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural louisiana circa 1957. she feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, maureen (a now rarely seen emily warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative baptist upbringing. then seventeen year old court foster (jason london), the son of her mother's close friend (gail strickland) moves in next door, dani experiences her first crush, while court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving dani behind. the sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when court dies in a tragic accident. the girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.sam waterson and tess harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. the beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring elvis presley, the platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.a touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message.

it's a generic coming-of-age story -- think "the member of the wedding," "summer of '42," "a summer place," even "little women" -- and there are moments where mulligan might have omitted the soupy music, not used slow-motion, or played down the golden-lit prettiness of the setting. otherwise, it's done with rare emotional perfect-pitch. nothing's forced, every line has feeling, and the pacing is just right. even the below-a-list casting helps: bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities might have overwhelmed the material. in particular, witherspoon is excellent: her line readings are fresh and original, and her body language is just right for a gawky, hoydenish 14-year-old on the eve of womanhood. waterston is also very fine, even if he has to spend much of the movie climbing in and out of the family truck.one senses that the film's makers were aware of its unpromising commercial prospects -- no big stars, no big car crashes, no special effects -- and consciously decided to make the best possible movie, box office be damned. it's intimate and honest, and it sticks to the ribs. if you find yourself misting up at the end, you don't have to feel you've been duped.

not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography (screenplay, acting, setting, etc.) but also for it's realism. this movie could take place in any farm or rural setting. it makes no difference if the movie takes place in louisiana or if it would take place in kansas. the story and the messages it includes would remain the same. this movie shows family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers. everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, i know i did. the ending hits way too close to home for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it. the ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film. not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations.

here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching. and mostly, it's for two reasons. one, it concentrates of young people, very young people. people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time, or at least think they are. all of us have been there in our lives and "the man in the moon" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories, maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. the second reason is that is a love triangle. and i do believe that as teens, it's the most dramatic. and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love, or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs, will believe it for the rest of their lives.the cast of "the man in the moon" is full of great talented names. it stars sam waterston, who is truly a versatile actor, well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict, yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. also there is tess harper, jason london, and a young, young reese witherspoon. you look at the young, talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road, she's going to win the academy award. all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay, they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. as if it all really happened. this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often. love story or not. i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way.

that magical moment in life, that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood, and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about. danni (wonderfully played by reese witherspoon) is right at that moment in life when the movie starts. she swoons over elvis, playing his records and wishfully thinking about love. maureen her sister will soon be off to college, has no trouble with attracting boys, is beautiful, and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't. she dates a local loser whos father is also after her, and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet. danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough. she wants to be maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself.the moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets court foster for the first time. court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers. he has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun. on one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find danni skinny dipping. they yell and argue and danni leaves. but they see each other a day later when courts mother is invited to danni's to visit old friends(danni's parents). danni becomes attracted to court, and court to danni. she is a tomboy and is spunky, has attitude and says whats on her mind. court is 17 and danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between court working the farm. by the time court kisses her one day, danni is smitten. danni's father tells her to invite court to the house and he does. but things are uncomfortable for court on his "sort of date". the silence though is broken by his meeting with maureen who has yet to see court. one look between the two and its all over. the looks of pain and defeat on danni's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time. the rest of the movie i will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters.the greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love, and the pain they must endure both together and individually. danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair, painful, and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started. few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly. this movie has since the first time i watched it stuck in my mind. its in the my top 100 movie list and deservedly so. i only wish more movies like this were made, because if so . . . my faith in hollywood would be a lot better.

"the man in the moon" is a pretty good movie. it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects. i wouldn't say the film was terribly original, but what is these days?the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles. i really enjoyed seeing reese witherspoon at such a young age, and does quite a good job. jason london does a fine job as well. and the only other person i recognized was sam waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. i really liked sam's character (matthew trant) a lot. at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread, but in the end you really like his character. the rest of the cast was very good as well.if you're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you, then you ought to watch this film. i'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in, then go for it. anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-chris

as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic. as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again! the swimming pond (it's called a "tank" in central texas), the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit! the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end. through the pain we go through in life...life goes on and there can be forgiveness.

reese witherspoon plays dani, a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new 17 year old neighbor, court, played by jason london. court tries his best to make dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable. soon the nubile charm of dani starts winning over court's will. next enters the meeting of dani's older sister, played by emily warfield, and the beginning of a short lived love/jealousy problem.tess harper and sam waterston round out the cast. this is a fresh, free spirited; but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep. feel free to cry.

dani(reese witherspoon) has always been very close with her older sister maureen(emily warfield) until they both start falling in love with their neighbor court(jason london). but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away.this was truly a heartbreaking story about first love. probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen. all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie. i would give the man in the moon 8.5/10

a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by, while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. that is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan. mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of '42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the coming of age genre. here he directs newcomers in the principal roles: reese witherspoon, in her film debut, as the 14 year old girl; emily warfield, as the older sister; jason london, as court, the 17 year old boy. reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut, displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt, never striking a false note. warfield and london are both equally good as well. the film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity, never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. the music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis, who was in his 70's when this was shot. tess harper and sam waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957, caring, strict, and emotionally simple. gail strickland is good also as the boy's mother. there are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. to date, this is robert mulligan's last film. this is one of the very best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.

perfect movies are rare. even my favorite films tend to have flaws - rear window looks a little stagey at times, chris elliot's character in groundhog day doesn't work, the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. the script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some miramax scores that are too manipulative). every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it. i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. brilliant! a must-see.

"the man in the moon" is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. director robert mulligan magically re-creates screenwriter jenny wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting, lyrical musical score. this film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times.this film is incredible, all the acting first rate, especially sam waterston and an astonishing performance by reese witherspoon in her film debut. you will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the trant family farm comes to a conclusion."the man in the moon" was a limited release in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it. buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. this film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest.

generally i like something light and fun, so this film shouldn't have appealed to me. but it grabbed me from the start. the story of a family's choices and challenges seem obvious, but it raises the question over and over: "what if it was my family? my choice?" i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt. it was in places difficult to watch, but more difficult to turn away. the story is true, and life is sometimes difficult to watch! it shows what film-makers can do without sex, violence, or special effects: a good story is a good story all by itself. the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones. like real life, you really don't know what'll happen next, or why people do the things that they do!

to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue. that is not what this film is.what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon. to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted. yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film.it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - 'if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it'

this was a gem. amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham, orla brady and all the supporting cast. the movie raises a subject not only pertinent to ireland and irish history but to many communities around the world and many marriage units within those communities. with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious convictions and traditions drove a wedge on a loving and passionate family. the title "love divided" couldn't capture it any better. even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the 50th seeing how the life of the whole village erodes and "pogroms" are starting reminded me of russian history. the intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature. just like in the movie the liam cunningham's character says "the hatred had always been there under the surface". it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story. also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful. the story however gives hope that love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. liam cunningham's character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be. again acting is a top notch. story is fast-paced. irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. highly recommended.

oh dear . yet another example of " oireland " and religion . no doubt we'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some " hunky and macho freedom fighters " from the ira . well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock . what a superb movie the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s . there is a slight problem since they're getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they're old enough . the story - which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they'll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford . from there things escalate let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece ? perhaps i shouldn't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i don't claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there's no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isn't blameless herself . think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . there's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member ( that makes a change . we're not talking about the devil's own here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which i agree with . if there's any sort of criticism it's that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses

oh wow. i saw this film at the irish international film fleadh in manhattan on 12 march 2000. both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward. what a gorgeous film! although set in ireland amid catholic/protestant antagonism, the story could have happened anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. the horror of how quickly people can get carried away when they are given a chance to vent their hate and anger was woven beautifully with a moving love story drizzled with humor and fun. if this one does not get picked up in the usa, it would truly be most unfortunate.as for the stars and supporting players...first rate. they call orla brady the irish meryl streep, i heard. it is my opinion that she is better than meryl streep. they should be calling meryl the american orla brady! and, liam cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant.see this movie.

i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion, and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect.a love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine. at the beginning of the film, we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children. sean is catholic and sheila is protestant, but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic. there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village. the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school. the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this "sin" and soon has sheila's husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father, the local dairy farmer. in an act of defiance and desperation, sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area.special note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila. she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment. on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community.if fiction, this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama. considering it is true, it changes to a horrific tragedy. in real life, the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there. it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events, and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area, they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers.whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice, crashing planes into buildings, subjugating women, condemning whole races, or just plain on torture and murder, we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society.

this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see, the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world'. the movie, by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (though they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action).the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church *did* organise vetoes of minorities (before protestants it was the jews).the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland

this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events. unfortunately not everything in life, including religion, are all nice and rosy. sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective do not look as great as they once did. "a love divided" tells the story of a family, yes it does incorporate religion, but really the story is about a family, and that family's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them. this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family. both churches are at fault here, the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight. in this case both let this family down. i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family. it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church, just the opposite, it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves.

to me, the final scene, in which harris responds to the press corp, is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics(especially the campaign phase). if only the "real-life" pols would respond in the intelligent, articulate manner as did mr harris,then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing.

hugh (ed harris) is a hotshot, bachelor senator determined to run for president. one day, however, he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie. aggie (diane keaton) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. hugh is smitten. he convinces aggie to become his fiancé. but, will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics, where things are not always what they seem to be? and, will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz? this is, mostly, a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection. hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view. however, although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality, it doesn't completely succeed. nevermind. the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written. with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris, those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment.

i married a japanese woman 14 years ago. we're still together.however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy.life in the military had been mined for action, drama, and comedy for years by this point. mined to death. the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover. this is old hat today, but then...? marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort. this touched on both possibilities along with the third. maybe it is love? brando did his usual good job. garner did a better job than he usually does. he's good, but this showed how good he could be. umecki-chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue, she didn't really stretch. it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker.the real scene stealer was red buttons. red was the best thing in this film. bank on it. and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well.a classic.

having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after memorial day, i finally got to seeing sayonara just this morning. in this one marlon brando plays major lloyd "ace" gruver, a general's son who's been raised a certain way, being transfered from korea to japan where his girlfriend eileen webster (patricia owens) conveniently happens to be. before leaving, he tries to persuade one of his men, a joe kelly (red buttons), out of marrying japanese woman katsumi (miyoshi umeki) since that's a violation of military fraternization laws. with the romance of him and eileen on the outs, however, ace not only becomes the best man at joe and katsumi's wedding, he falls for an asian himself after he and captain mike bailey (james garner) go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer hana-ogi (miiko taka) on stage. bailey himself is dating one of the dancers, fumiko-san (reiko kuba). eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the kabuki performers, nakamura (ricardo montalban). i'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning american-asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end. even seeing hispanic montalban playing an oriental isn't too embarrassing (though it's a good thing his part is short). and there's some nice touches of humor like that of brando's head hitting the top of button's and umeki's inside doorway more than once. red and miyoshi themselves deserve their oscars especially red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. rookie garner, before being cast in his legendary role on tv's "marverick", is fine in his scenes with brando and miiko taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti-american. while i've read there were some changes from james michener's novel, i can't imagine director josha logan, who had previously adopted another michener work into the broadway musical "south pacific" and would eventually make that into a movie as well, not staying true to the original source. he certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist. some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise, sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated america and japan at the time.

brando plays the ace jet pilot, just back from shooting migs down in the korean war. on leave, he discovers his madame butterfly, falls in love. the lovers both see the folly of racism and the cruelty which conservative cultural norms can bring to human relations.this film is an excellent romance with a nice twist which rejects the racist, conservative standards, dominant at the time it was made in 1957. "sayonara" will make you laugh and cry. beware though, sometimes the musical background will make you wish it was not there, although, irving berlin's title song will entice your memory for a very long time after your theatre lights come on again.

released in december of 1957, sayonara went on to earn 8 oscar nominations and would pull in 4 wins. red buttons won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as airman joe kelly who falls in love with a japanese woman while stationed in kobe during the korean war. oscar nominated for best leading actor, marlon brando plays major lloyd gruver, a korean war flying ace reassigned to japan, who staunchly supports the military's opposition to marriages between american troops and japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend joe kelly out of getting married. ironically marlon brandos character soon finds love of his own in a woman of japanese descent. this movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time. filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds i found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone. good movie, gimme more...gimmeclassics

this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen. yes, i can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film. one should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. clearly by the "sex in the city" standards, charlie chaplin was horribly boring. however, when judged from the prospective of 1925 america, he was fantastic. likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, american "manifest destiny" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman's agreement. its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget.however, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. although, some attack brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. buttons and umeki (who both won oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film's end is equally good. of course, it doesn't have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better. it portrays true love and passion, and not just "heat." if this movie doesn't touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.

i have seen several comments here about brando using a southern accent, some of which felt it was a mistake. when this movie was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the south. the jim crow laws were still in effect. civil rights was in it's infancy. could this have possibly been a subtle social commentary, a southern man in love with a woman of another race? the same way mash was a subtle criticism of the viet nam war? any thoughts?another comment was made about myoshi umeki appearing "cold". anyone who has been in japan would understand. the japanese people, at least in my experience, did not tend to show emotion in front of strangers. there were strict social rules, especially for men meeting single women. americans in japan were totally foreign to this culture, and the blunt attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. one trait of the japanese was to smile when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many american servicemen took as a sign that their advances were welcomed. also remember that at the time represented in the movie, japan had just been defeated, and the occupying forces were treated with reluctant acceptance. i think myoshi umeki gave a very credible performance of what her situation would have been. watching her interaction with the american actors brought back several memories of my own experiences in the country. i was able to meet a pair of lovely young ladies who, after i convinced them i was not the typical american male, taught me their language and their culture during my time in their country.

personally, i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made. it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy. and brando should have won for best actor. anyway, the movie is awesome, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! do so, and fall in love.

i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american servicemen and japanese women in post-war japan--as well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them. brando goes from having contempt for the japanese (which is natural considering ww2) to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her. his performance is okay (i am not a major fan of his acting style) and the movie is marvelous throughout. red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another gi who falls in love in japan (though the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable job).i don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of tissues.this movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time. a mostly underrated gem.

any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry.aside from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl...boy gets girl back....the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt. general webster(riccardo montalban is a close second)...my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general...the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a wonder they show him any respect at all.brando's southern accent is a little overdone, and some scenes have a few holes but overall, i enjoy the film every time i see it.red buttons is great...i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles...as in button's case, often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor.

the books of james michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for rodgers&hammerstein. south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another michener success, sayonara.it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly. i'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight. that and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance.sayonara is a relevant film today. the military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally. in america at the time sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. today gays in the military is a big issue. someone may one day do a sayonara like film on that issue.joshua logan was on familiar ground. south pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. with a sure hand, logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.marlon brando, patricia owens, james garner, kent smith some of the occidental players do a fine job. but the picture is stolen by the orientals here. miko taka hits the mark beautifully as brando's love interest. but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars, red buttons and miyoshi umeki.buttons is your everyman enlisted man air force member. he falls passionately in love with katsumi played by miyoshi umeki. they marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up. they presume to know what's best for buttons and umeki. buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent, but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career.and miyoshi umeki's oscar was the first one given to an oriental. it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards, miyoshi was starring on broadway in flower drum song. i was privileged to see it on broadway, it was the first broadway show i ever saw. i still carry the memory of it.that oscar symbolized something else too. our war with japan was really over and we saw in sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture.ricardo montalban plays nakamura, a kabuki theatre actor. if sayonara were done today, logan would never get away with it. but montalban is fine. good location photography and a grand story. this film should be revived more often it has a great moral.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos. i especially like the way the characters welcomed gina's various suitors. with friends (and family) like these anyone would feel nurtured and loved. i found the writing witty and natural and the actors made the material come alive.

this is actually one of my favorite films, i would recommend that everyone watches it. there is some great acting in it and it shows that not all "good" films are american....

la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film. everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning. it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access.this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale. i must advice that this is not a sample film.please enjoy!!!

no other movie has made me feel like this before... and i don't feel bad. like, i don't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie (9 months) nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______. the reason i say "_____" is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up. i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather. no movie has ever done this to me before. never in my life have i wanted cauliflower, milk, and baguettes this much. thank you. - eduh. *clears throat* no words. no thoughts. i don't know. i truly don't know. - cait

******* spoiler! ********i saw this gr8 film a few years back, its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it. he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her. throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get "aroused" and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love, friendship and lovely pairs of jugs heheits brilliantdont be put off by sub-tit-les hehe!

this is a warm, funny film, in much the same vein as the works of almodovar. sure it has a 10 year old boy sucking milk from breasts, but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted (but would i be willing to let my 10-year old son play the part? not so sure!). spanish cinema is often quite sexual, but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink. i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude, we'd be much better off as a result.this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'fartman maurice' character. as his lover says to him: 'most people are embarrassed about farting. you turn it into an art form.'

la teta i la luna (the breast and the moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya. i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in bigas luna's movies (also director of jamon, jamon). tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. also being from catalunya (north-east of spain) it brought lots of memories to my mind. this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is, nice people, nice life and specially lots of non-uptight people.

probably bigas luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. the delicious mathilda may, who spent most of tobe hooper's "lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young biel duran's pre-teen lust. he can't get may's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. his pursuit of may is the film. as in luna works such as "lulu" and "jamon! jamon!", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. the usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. josé luis alcaine's images are gorgeous and nicola piovani's score is sweet and rich. a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally.

i enjoyed a lot watching this movie. it has a great direction, by the already know bigas luna, born in spain. and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place, in cataluña, to be more precise.luna explores once more the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women's milk. there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son. so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.this movie lives a lot on imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something...). the surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times... worth living in that world, worth watching this movie, even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 8/10

gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film. the last 15 minutes (or thereabouts) are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch. the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film. it's not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if i were to be honest) to see it is peck. for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament.

other than susan hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made. henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes, and peck is, as always, impeccable. the stirring alfred newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years. the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made. this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, "the song of ruth" and "esther and the king." it is worth watching, and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan. the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol, david's estranged first wife.

this film has all the size and grandeur of many of the great biblical epics of the 1950's and '60's. but it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves. the best thing about it is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. this is a unique and compelling balance that helps us to realize that even great people like david are flawed people who find their faith and greatness in facing their flaws.the actors are all first rate in the film from gilbert barnett as david's second son absolom through to the wonderful susan hayward as bathsheba. hayward is at her best in this film. her own truthful but larger than life style of acting is quite at home here. she is ever the seductress, but she plays the role in such a way that you sympathize with her.raymond massey does a great job as nathan the prophet. as a child when i first saw the film, massey seemed like he truly had just conversed with the lord himself and was an awesome sight. no doubt helped also by the great music composed by the always amazing alfred newman who also had great successes in other biblical epics like "the robe" and "the greatest story ever told" along with perhaps 100 other films too! the cinema photography by leon shamroy is well done and adds to the size but also the intimacy of the film. henry king, a truly underrated film director who like william wyler never really pigeon-holed himself into any one genre, pulls together a larger than life production that never loses sight of the love story between david and bathsheba and david's own deep struggle with his faith in god. the path tread in this film could have been very hokey, but king keeps it real and interesting all the way. plus we never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of god, just as david himself is struggling with the same. from the first scene where a soldier dies trying to save the ark from destruction. david is not satisfied with nathan's answer, (to paraphrase)that no one can understand the will of god. this is the journey we embark on right through to the powerful ending where david is finally confronted with himself.finally this film belongs to gregory peck who wonderful as king david. his david is a man you can believe could rule a country ruthlessly but was at one time a faithful singer of psalms. this is one of his best performances.i don't see this movie on television much anymore, but when i do i never fail to watch it. i think it still holds up very well today.

watching david&bathsheba is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school. despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining. the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for. peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba, susan hayward. raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance. look for the silent screen star francis x. bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer. hooray for the old testament and hollywood.

david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f. zanuck, directed by henry king and starring gregory peck {king david}, susan hayward (bathsheba), raymond massey (nathan), kieron moore (uriah) and jayne meadows (michal).the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible. it follows king david, who as a child had slain the giant goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel. a tough and assured king, david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems. for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower {re;bath}, it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon.typically for the genre, david & bathsheba is a large, grandiose production. from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography {leon shamroy}, it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values. untypically, tho, the film is sedately paced and relies on 99% of its worth being driven purely by dialogue. this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. this is a very humanist picture, in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here, it's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart. but that is no bad thing at all, because breaking it down we find it's very well acted {peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well & hayward is pushing it to the max}, and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king. and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing, the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne's (the ghost and mrs. muir) oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical/swords & sandals genres (most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point), but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres. 7/10

i've always believed that david and bathsheba was a film originally intended for tyrone power at 20th century fox, although gregory peck does give a good account of himself as king david, the monarch with a wandering eye.a whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film, adultery, redemption, sin, punishment and generally what god expects from his followers.when you're a king, even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us. king david has many wives, including one really vicious one in jayne meadows who was the daughter of saul, david's predecessor. but his eyes catch sight of bathsheba out in her garden one evening. turns out she's as unhappily married to uriah the hittite as david is to quite a few women. uriah is one of david's army captains. david sends for bathsheba and him being the king, she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.what happens, an affair, a pregnancy, and a carefully arranged death for uriah in a battle. but an all seeing and knowing deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing david and bathsheba, but the entire kingdom of israel is being punished with drought, disease, and pestilence.the sexist law of the day calls for bathsheba to have a stoning death. david shows weakness in his previous actions, but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. he even lays hands on the ark of the covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film.my interpretation of it is that god admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on david and forgives them both. bathsheba becomes the mother of solomon and she and david are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of israel and judah until they're both conquered.susan hayward is a fetching bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with uriah played by kieron moore. the only thing that gets moore aroused is a good battle. i liked kieron moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. no one can lay the law down like raymond massey. his nathan the prophet is in keeping with the john brown character he played in two films, same intensity. so when his own law called for death, why did god spare bathsheba and keep david on the throne. maybe it was the fact he just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. he'd replaced saul with david already. but i think the christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the new testament forthcoming, that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. i'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.

there's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  "i was quite a hand with a slingshot," "the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy" (full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face), "go and sit with the concubines." and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan "whatever you say." he even tries the old "my kingdom doesn't understand me" routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point. so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide. maybe it's the censor-baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it!  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.unlike king david, which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul, david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan's death, gregory peck's performance grows in stature as david shrinks. susan hayward is pure hollywood pro, raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and kieron moore's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in harm's way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death. with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s biblical epics.fox's new dvd is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.

to me movies and acting is all about telling a story. the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best. to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel, made this story all the more compelling. you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman, gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life. susan hayward's fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her. one could also feel david's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. raymond massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger. the sets were real enough, and the atmosphere believable. all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind. i gave it a rating of ten.

old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one "the man in the grey flannel robe." most bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck, tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him. as a great romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. but there is something gripping about this movie. of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god. billy sunday's thesis is duking it out with h.l. mencken's antithesis all through the script. who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. other than that, d & b boasts a good performances by peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene) and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol, vivid, moody atmosphere (good idea to set most action at dawn or night), and the rousing rendition of the twenty-third psalm at the end.

this film is famous for several qualities: a literate script, for once in partly-religious film-making, by philip dunne, some very good performances, a first-rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king. if one were making a film, then getting such talents as leon shamroy as cinematographer, lyle wheeler as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production. add the cast of this film, including gregory peck and susan hayward as the title characters, james robertson justice, raymond massey, kieron moore, jayne meadows and john sutton plus a dance by gwen verdon and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special. but in a biblical subject script, usually a sub-genre prone to illogical motivations and miraculous interventions, everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills. philip dunne here has supplied human beings, a rare achievement in biblical films. david is a man in this film, many-sided, not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament. gregory peck makes him curious, passionate, self-controlled, self-deprecating and appealing. as bathsheba, hayward is scarcely the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common-sense earthiness and emotional normalcy that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her. the rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns. the familiar storyline provides them little to work with, but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations. david's youth is told in flashback; how he was chosen by a prophet of yahweh to be king of israel, and earns his way to be second to the king, saul, by defeating goliath the phiiistine in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior. thereafter, he finally is driven from the court of king saul of israel, becomes a famous warrior, and returns to claim the kingdom and become the instrument of death of jonathan, the king's son, formerly a friend. his wars are successful-- the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene; but his life is empty since his wife michal, jayne meadows, is saul's daughter and is cold to him. he turns to bathsheba, whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked; later she admits she had hoped he would see her. but she has a husband, uriah; when she becomes pregnant, it becomes necessary for uriah to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home; he instead asks david to set him in the forefront of the battle, even after being aroused by verdon's dance. david agrees. he is killed, a war hero; but this does not solve the infidelity question. drought comes to israel, and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon. at last, david places his hands on the ark of the covenant, recently brought to jerusalem and housed in a temple, which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it, inviting his god to punish him--and nothing happens...david exits the temple, and finds that rain has come to his parched land. this film is always interesting, varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful. the director and author make use of the observer principle, and are frankly more successful in humanizing the characters than in almost any film outside the grecianized- near eastern canon, wherein the feat is a bit easier since neither miraculous nor religious themes are made central in such adventures. . well-remembered for its glowing realization, fine performances and intelligent dialogue, this dramatic effort bears repeated study.

to some, this biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation... others see it as a story of grace, restoration, and hope... it is actually both  henry king illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin, and his upward climb of healing..'david and bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... henry king handles the powerful story, taken from the old testament, with skill...david, 'the lion of judah,' having stormed the walls of rabgah, saves the life of one of his faithful warriors uriah (kieron moore), and returns to jerusalem... back at his court, his first wife complains of neglect, and offends him for being a shepherd's son, distinguishing herself for being the daughter of king saul...one evening, and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood, david's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... she was beautiful and attractive... david could not take his eyes off her... he finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers... sending for her, he discovers that she, too, is unhappy in her marriage... by this point, it's apparent that david's intentions shift from an interest in taking bathsheba as a wife, to just plain taking bathsheba... as usual, sin had its consequences, and david hadn't planned on that possibility...when a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine, david suspects that the lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... but when bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of moses, david tries to cover up his sin... he sends word to joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send to him bathsheba's husband... david did something that was abominable in god's sight... he sends the man to the front line where he would be killed... the soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way, david marries his beloved bathsheba in full regal splendor...god punishes the couple when bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... meanwhile, a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the israelites - led by nathan - blame the king for their plight... they storm the palace and demand that bathsheba pays for her sin...peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity.. hayward as bathsheba, is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery... the sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in biblical film history, is badly mishandled, and the viewers eyes are led briefly to hayward's face and shoulders...raymond massey appeared as nathan the prophet, sent by god to rebuke david after his adultery with bathsheba; gwyneth verdon is queen michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to david's personality and kingship; ex-silent screen idol, francis x. bushman, had a brief part as king saul... the best moments of the film were: the ark en route to its permanent home when god breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the defining moment in david's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death; and for the film's climax, inserting it as a flashback, david remembering his fight with the giant goliath... with superb color photography and a masterly music score, 'david and bathsheba' won oscar nominations in the following categories: music scoring, art and set direction, cinematography, story and screenplay, and costume design..

i saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it! bend it like beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-age movie about a fairly atypical girl. this is parminder nagra ("er")'s breakout role, playing jess, a teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football (that's soccer to us north americans). and even though she's actually much older than her character, she plays the role pitch-perfect.this is a movie about friendship - specifically jess's friendship with jules (keira knightley), her teammate who is also going through family issues, especially with her mom, who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes, and who wants jules to be more feminine, wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is a lesbian. jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams. they also, unfortunately, both love the same man - joe, their coach (played by jonathan rhys-meyers). the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship.in some spots, bend it like beckham falls into clichés. in others, scenes drag on far too long, and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing.but this was a refreshingly fun film about growing up, culture clash, and the love of football. it's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams, and supporting your friends. funny, charming and fun, bend it like beckham is the little film that could... and did.excellent. 8/10.

to "bend it like beckham" may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football (soccer), but to english sports fans, it is equivalent to "hit it like bonds" or "dunk it like jordan." any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal, much like star player david beckham does, much like the young indian girl, jess (parminder nagra), does in the film bend it like beckham. jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. however, while playing one day, a passing friend named jules (keira knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. after satisfying the coach joe (jonathan rhys-meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. the movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. there is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. the movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. the soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. bend it like beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.

great movie -i loved it. great editing and use of the soundtrack. captures the real feeling of indian life, yet we can all relate. a well chose cast with some great characters. the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them. the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural. you just can't help but to root for jess in this film! the acting was really good, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.

this was an adorable movie. a real feel-good movie when you need one. the story is light (this is no gone with the wind) but sometimes, one needs this kind of plot. funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes/wardrobe.parminder k. nagra (also from the tv show er) is wonderful in this role. she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood. all should keep an eye on her, she's going to be big in the future.also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie. a nice mix of modern and indian tunes. i was dancing throughout most of the movie.highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need.

"bend it like beckham" is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states. it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the u.s. it's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here. i think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, "bend it like beckham" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting. i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner. i highly recommend this movie!

not one of your harder-hitting stories, and that's a real strength of this film. there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. they not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. there are a few disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, relaxed fun.btw, if you get the dvd, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. we followed her directions and it was brilliant! next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!

nagra comes from conservative indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer. but our attractive young star can play some serious soccer. rhys-meyers coaches nagra and encourages her to perform, while knightley is supportive teammate and friend. when sis' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match, what's a girl to do? similar in its own unique way to bfgw as nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways. here it's dad (well-played by kher) who can see both sides of the issue. docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis, if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere. nice final wrap up to the whole deal.

"bend it like beckham" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by john hughes. everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. nothing wrong with this, however. "bend it like beckham" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). watch this movie and enjoy.grade: b+

what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted. similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has, though i think that's probably because of the mention of 'beckham' in the title more than anything else.it's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message - you can do anything if you're determined enough, and put your mind to it, which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film.i think this is one of keira knightley's better films, and i think she's a brilliant actress, and was excellent for the role. parminder nagra was brilliant too. sadly, i can't say this for jonathan rhys-meyers, because i don't think that he was that much of a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a little scary.all in all, a brilliant film, and a brilliant story

originally i rented this film for my daughter since she is keen on soccer - and i was not disappointed that way (except the plot interfered with the soccer scenes). as a dad i suppose i was a little surprised at the introduction of the topic of lesbianism - but i have to admit that as a parent these issues are completely available to children nowadays (as uncomfortable as i feel with the topic). in a way this emotion was a segue right into the main premise of the film - that at some age you must trust your children to make their own choices. this dilemma is introduced by a young british-born teen girl - jasminder (jess) - of east-indian heritage who dreams of playing professional soccer. the pending marriage of her older sister in a traditional hindu marriage provides many rich opportunities for her to explore (in a nice way) her hopes and fears for her future. the multi-cultural challenge was a very interesting technique to explore jess's frustration with her parents expectations for her - again no different in substance than most child-parent relationships. in summary, the soccer scenes are great (lots to learn in slowmo) and while i didn't need the storyline - something was needed to keep the movie going.

this is a so called 'feel-good' movies, however it made me sad in a way. why? because i had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer.and soccer is the red line in this movie. together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have. an english-indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy, and plays soccer... a combination which worries her mother! this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people, as well as the indian community in england. it is about believe in your dreams, and live your one life (where did we hear that before).paraminder nagra (a beautiful women!) plays yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff. in contradiction with her sister pinky, complete the opposite of yasminda.a real must it is, to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents, and finds her luck eventually. with great music from blondie, curtis mayfield, texas, melanie c, as well as indian hit songs.pleasant to watch, but if you, as myself, ever played soccer, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic.

bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives. i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. the song choices are really good, 'hush my child, just move on up...to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.' anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review. bend it like beckham great flick

gurinda chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near heahthrow airport in west london.like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess bhamra (parminder nagra) and jules paxton (keira knightley) as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with david beckham.much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds.somewhere in the middle, as broker, peacemaker and blighted athlete, joe (jonathan reece-myers) - team coach for the hounslow harriers - intercedes in times of crisis, while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters.eventually, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams.with great performances from bollywood veteran anupam kher (mr bhamra), shaheen khan (mrs bhamra), juliet stevenson (mrs paxton) and frank harper (mr paxton) this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers.pinky bamrha (archie panjabi) and (taz) trey farley are struggling their own struggles, but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film.in it's own special way, this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football. it celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old.

this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone. on my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series, spirited away and fly away home.i can really relate to the main character jess. at the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. she really sucks you into her life. i also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. the movie is never boring. the romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! one thing that really made it though was the indian factor. jess' parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. the indian people are also hilarious! essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. they're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~

i love this movie. it is great film that combines english and indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men. it shows the struggles of both an indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports, especially in england at the time. i feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues.in contrast to the other comment, i do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other such chick flick. this move is loved by many types of people, men and women, young and old alike.

it's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. anupam kher is wonderful as jess' worried father, and jonathan rhys-meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'ride with the devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous irish accent! even if you don't like football, go see this film. if anything it'll make you smile.

how can a movie be both controversial and gentle? this one does it with a near-perfect structure. no one wants their daughters to be athletes. apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small-breasted, either. here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to, and have the potential to, become professional soccer players. the structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. there is no condescension. both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (and yes, both are silly, too). one flaw: the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them.

i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards. parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi. jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach. jazz (parminder nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet (kiera knightlety) and joe (jonathon rhyes meyers) who is her coach. when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky (archie punjabi's) wedding. at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.

this movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes, dreams, love and friendship, and incorporates humour beautifully. along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming, the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art. all actors and actresses give an extremely good performance, surpassing expectation in every way. parminder nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film, and she is exceptional, capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about. keira knightly also works well with her co-stars, and this is her best work so far.all in all, this is brilliant film, and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once.

10/10 for this film.i'm a british india doctor, currently in india. the word beckham put me off, 'cos i'm a die hard liverpool fan, and personally think that owen is really cool. since liverpool and man utd are rivals, i was dead sure that i wouldn't watch the film.but then i was in delhi to meet some friends, and i had an early morning flight, so i thought, "what the heck, let's bide time by watching this film", 'cos it was a late night show.what a moron i was. i should've seen this film the day it was released. i guess using beckham's name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can't think of a better title for the film.and nagra, knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and rhys-myers did a superb job.if you hate football, dislike manchester united (or england for that matter), then this is definately the film for you. in fact, i'm just 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. this film has knocked "star wars" off my no.1 position.surprisingly, there aren't very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me. i wonder why?10/10 for this film.

jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy and learn how to cook.bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is. the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny.a great family movie 8/10

as an anti-football person, i (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii. the trailers looked fun so i thought i'd give it a go.it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen, and that wasn't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium. the acting was fresh and vibrant, the characters engaging, and the jokes genuinely funny. the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so. football fan or no football fan, sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy i've seen in a long time, dare i say it.... better than east is east.this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace, never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished, keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film, there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect.saying that, there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers. i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted/let down by the ending. personally, if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers.as for the actors, i would have to say that juliet stevenson (paula) put in the finest performance. i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do! prize for the most unconvincing (of the main characters) goes, unfortunately, to kiera knightley (jules), but don't get me wrong, even she offered a great performance, it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera, this time you're it.tip: don't leave before the credits. once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i shouldn't have watched this film after all. my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. oh, what am i saying, it was absolutely brill and i can't recommend it enough. i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. i'm a student. i only splash out if it's really worth it.

david beckham is a british soccer star and the husband of victoria beckham ("posh spice" of the spice girls). his trademark is a goal shot that curves across the pitch and into the net. the soccer equivalent of an unhittable curve ball in baseball. "bend it like beckham" means making that type of spectacular shot. apart from that, and a little shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo at the very end, the movie has nothing to do with him.the movie is full of little soccer in-jokes, such as the present that one of the characters' parents give her of a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the great mia hamm, to those in the know), references to "posh 'n' becks," the video homage to the wusa one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend ("they *have* that??"), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on.the story is about a teenage girl in england who idolizes beckham and wants to be a soccer star. she has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she must overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the uk (hence their fascination with our wusa), and her parents, who are indian immigrants set in very old-fashioned ways that do not allow daughters, among other things, to engage in contact sports. the girl's family are portrayed as figures of ironic fun, but with great affection -- think my big fat greek wedding. the girl loves and respects them enough to go through sitcom hell to conceal her growing soccer stardom from them.

my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when i vowed i love this film. bring on the coals; i'll walk over them as well to say again that i love "bend it like beckham." granted, there's a lot of "in spite of" in that confession. it's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. and, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.the film's genius is not in what's obvious to the syd field-doctored eye: character arcs, themes, construction. it's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath, but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. powerful, sometimes semi-clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do. these are real bodies (keira knightley's excepted) whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self-determination. and, in my book, lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective, "luminous," but because her performance has an honesty and un-bookish intelligence that's utterly compelling.the result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so. as in chadha's "bride and prejudice," the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy, sweet valley high categories of "best friends" or "sisters." perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism. "bend it like beckham" has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple hetero/homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest. the precise nature of its pleasure is, ultimately, a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it.oh yes, and did i mention that it's hilarious?

as someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed "bend it like beckham". but i gotta say, this was one cool movie! anglo-indian jesminder bhamra (parminder nagra) and her wasp friend juliette paxton (keira knightley) love to play football (yes, i'm going to say it the british - and international - way) and just adore football player david beckham. but jesminder's traditional sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! and if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of "bend" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (i'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie). and we all know that keira knightley hit it big: a few months after "bilb" came out in the states, she starred in the equally cool "pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl".

as a former 2 time okinawan karate world champion, i like movies about sacrifice for sport. but this movie is about so much more. this movie is so good and so deep. i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion. almost lights out for me. and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about. this is a movie about living. living your life for yourself and respect for others. empowerment. god, bless "bend it like beckham" i believe it is a true gem.

the title of this film nearly put me off watching it. not being a manchester united fan, the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting, however i put my prejudices behind me and i'm glad i did.i wasn't expecting much of a film, but i was pleasantly surprised. the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film. if you liked east is east then you'll love this film. ok so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it's all done very funnily, and with a breath of fresh air. the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained. the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour, and best of all it's a good british comedy.

wow, i can't believe i waited so long to see this film. i just never got around to watching it. the plot has nothing that interests me. i know nothing about soccer (football.) i am one of those american fools that has no clue. i had never even seen david beckham before this film. i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america. enough about me. truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie-making heaven. what a fun film. it's full of color and exuberance. i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. parminder nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can't help but root for her. no wonder why the american television show e.r. has snatched her up. i have a new appreciation for indian culture. those people know how to have a good time. the wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. the only problem i had was deciphering some of the british slang and dialogue through the accents. i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything. (this is not a criticism of the film!) i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in american films as well. this is a perfect date film. it has a great sports plot like rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. i watched it with my wife, and sixteen year old niece, and we all loved it. i highly recommend it.

okay, first of i hate commenting on this thing but i felt like i had to stand up for this movie. so many people were bashing on it and i felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.first off, bend it like beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century. if that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. it's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished.secondly, the acting though not "halle berry in monster's ball" is still good. the movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. it's a family movie. if that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly.lastly, it has a really cute story. i think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. it's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. if you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you.-lyndsay

despite louis b. mayer reportedly not being interested in signing the young greta garbo to a contract, this first american and mgm film for the actress looked quite beautiful. it's obvious that the film was assigned some amazing talent to film the production and make matte paintings, as it has all the nice polish and artfulness you'd expect from the best pictures the studio could produce. it simply looks beautiful--even 84 years later.as for garbo herself, like her other very early american films she, too, looks different. while she's quite recognizable, her makeup is much softer than it would become just a year later--giving her a less severe look and a gentleness about her you just didn't see in subsequent films. i kind of wish they'd kept this look, but considering how famous she'd become with the trademark look, who am i to say they shouldn't have gone that route?! the film is about garbo and how she and her family are unfairly forced off their land by the landlord. while the landlady, the much esteemed doña bernarda, claims it's because the bank has demanded payment, it's because her son has fallen for garbo--and what better way to get rid of her than to force them out on the streets! nice lady, huh?! years pass and by now garbo has become a new singing sensation who is world-famous. when she returns to her hometown years later, her old boyfriend (who had promised to marry her but wimped out when his mother, doña bernarda, refused to allow it) sees her. his new love for another lady is now tested--will he be content to marry this lady who is the heir to a huge pig fortune or will he want his old flame? and, more importantly, will garbo even take him back after he behaved so spinelessly? in the meantime, a huge rainstorm hits. the land begins to flood and homes soon are being washed away by the deluge. cortez and a friend make a mad dash as the dam breaks! in a scene where they obviously superimposed his row boat over the cascading stream, he eventually makes it out alive and to the home where garbo is now staying. she welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes. then, he admits that he still loves her and had braved the storm to make sure that she was safe. she tells him to get lost! next, you see ricardo about to get married to his second choice, the daughter of the pork king. he obviously has little enthusiasm for this--and you feel sorry for the lady, as she did nothing wrong. soon, cortez is seen wandering back to garbo's home--he's love-sick and needs her. in this scene, garbo is quite luminous and can't tell him to leave--as they dissolve in each other's arms. once again, he tells her of his love for her.when doña bernarda learns of this, she is not pleased. evidently, a pork queen is a better catch than an internationally known singer. because of the meddling of this nasty old lady, garbo leaves--unwilling to come between the mother and her wimpy son. but, cortez comes running--announcing he must have her and won't rest until he has her as his wife. moments after making this proclamation, a family friend talks to cortez and convinces him to give her up for the good of his career and reputation. so much for "won't rest until he has her for his wife", huh?! despite cortez being a wimp through and through, for some reason she cannot bring herself to hate him. and so, he marries the pork queen and lives a very dull life. when years later garbo meets cortez again, he is a dull looking middle-aged man--while she is as beautiful as ever. and, not surprisingly, she tells him, once again, to get lost.at the time this film was made, garbo was not a star in the us and cortez was. so, in light of this, it's surprising they gave cortez such an unlikable character to play. instead of the usual confident valentino-like role they'd been giving him, here he is an indecisive wimp--a huge wimp. and, from here on, his career was on a slow downward spiral. as for garbo, the role helped establish her as a big star--as she was the focus of the film and played a character much like her later personas.as for the film, the new music composed for it was very nice, though a tad repetitive. the print, oddly, was nearly perfect throughout except for the intertitle cards--which could use some restoration.a most enjoyable film--expertly constructed, wistful and worth seeing. and, for one of the few times i can think of it, i have no real complaints in this excellent film.

the film torrent was a first and a last for greta garbo. it was her first american made film at mgm, the only studio in the usa that she would ever work at. it was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits, that being her leading man her ricardo cortez.torrent is based on the popular spanish writer's vicente blasco ibanez's work entre naranjos. it concerns a pair of mismatched lovers, garbo and cortez, who can't quite get together, mostly due to the machinations of cortez's mother marta mattox. mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying. remember this is spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper. mattox has gertrude olmstead in mind as a daughter-in-law, she's the offspring of mack swain a man grown rich in hog raising. swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered.blasco ibanez had previous novels the four horseman of the apocalypse and blood and sand previously filmed with rudolph valentino in the lead. it might have been interesting if valentino had done this one with garbo, but he might have been beyond film making when this was done. in any event, one of the valentino wannabes ricardo cortez fills in with the male lead.one reason valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is garbo's unlike the other two works previously mentioned. when she gets done dirt by cortez who is doing what mattox and her 'adviser' banker tully marshall tell her, she leaves spain and goes to france where she becomes a great opera star. and leads quite the scandalous life there.when she returns to spain and tries to rekindle things, mattox is even more outraged. she has a political career in mind for her son. cortez is now running for the spanish parliament which curiously enough is called the cortes. the title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside. cortez in fact braves the torrent in a row boat trying to rescue garbo from harm's way. when they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality coming from garbo.the special effects here, primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time. they look very similar to the shots used in 20th century fox's the rains came that came out in 1939 and that won an oscar for special effects. unfortunately for torrent it came out one year before oscar made his debut.i'm not going to give any endings away so you'll have to see the film to find out if cortez and garbo get together in the end. garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting, she was remarkably subtle in her role. so she would be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for closeups.although greta garbo would go on to do far better work than torrent, this film is still a fitting debut for her on the american big screen and holds up very well for today's audience.

mgm were unsure of how to market garbo when she first arrived in hollywood. mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in "torrent" justified that. she did not speak a word of english so she must have found it difficult to work, also ricardo cortez did not make it very easy for her.the torrent of the title is the river juscar that winds through a sleepy little village in spain. leonora (greta garbo) hopes someday that her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. leonora and don rafael (ricardo cortez) are in love but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot get her to consent to his marriage. meanwhile dona brull (martha mattox) has evicted leonora's parents from their home and they send leonora to paris hoping to give her a chance to further her singing career. leonora sends a note to rafael, urging him to remember his promise and come with her. his mother is enraged and forbids him to go - so of course he caves in to her request.years pass. leonora has a new identity - she has become la brunna, the toast of the paris opera. rafael has turned out just as his mother wished - he is running for office and is courting a "safe" young girl, remedios (gertrude olmstead) who is a "hog" heiress. mack swain plays her father. leonora decides to visit her old home, and i agree - why hasn't she helped her mother out. her mother is still living at the family home, working as a skivvy and taking in washing. leonora and rafael meet but leonora is full of ridicule. garbo is so enchantingly beautiful, it is hard to believe that he could be happy with remedios.the dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town. leonora's house is in the path of the raging river but when rafael attempts to rescue her he finds she is quite safe. they then re-kindle their romance. there is a "horizontal" love scene in this film, very similar to the one in "flesh and the devil".dona brull goes spreading gossip about how leonora really got her wealth and leonora's mother believes her and tells leonora to go. rafael meets leonora just before she is about to tour america. again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down. he spends so much time listening to other people destroy her reputation - "what will she do for you but drag you down". the irony is she has just secured a top government job for him if he comes with her. they meet again, years later - she is as fresh and vibrant as ever - he looks older than his years, bowed down by mediocrity.it is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.lucien littlefield does a good job as cupido, the barber and leonora's old and faithful friend.highly recommended.

greta garbo's american film debut is an analogy of how our lives can be swept off course by fate and our actions, as in a torrent, causing us to lose a part of ourselves along the way.greta plays leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with ricardo cortez's character don rafael, a landowner. ricardo is in love with her too, but is too easily influenced by his domineering mother. leonora ends up homeless and travels to paris, where she becomes a famous opera singer and develops the reputation for being a loose woman. in reality, part of her attitude is bitterness over rafael's abandonment.she returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts rafael. surprisingly, no one knows that she's the famous la brunna, and garbo acts up her role as the diva she truly was and re prised with such cool haughtiness in her later portrayals.ricardo cortez reminds one a lot of valentino in looks in this part, and he was groomed to be a valentino clone by mgm, though he never thought he could be in reality and he was right. he is believable in an unsympathetic part as a weak willed mama's boy, and allows himself to age realistically but comically at the end of the movie. he fails to win leonora when she returns home, and later when he follows her, his courage is undermined.this movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant storm sequences and the sets depicting spain at the time are authentic looking. there are also some fine secondary performances by old timers lucien littlefield, tully marshall, and mack swain.although this is a story of lost love and missed chances, i don't think leonora and rafael would have been happy together, as he needed a more traditional wife and she was very much a career woman, and i don't think would have been happy in a small village. the ending is true to life and pulls no punches.see this one as garbo's american film debut and a precursor of things to come

this film was quite a surprise. i wasn't expecting much, to be honest. greta garbo's first hollywood film? so what? probably something rough and with the usual exaggerated arm-waving and facial contortions that low-grade silent films so often show.well, was i mistaken. greta garbo must have just shocked the studio people as much as she did me, because this film made her a star, and deservedly so. she instinctively understood the power of just standing still, or of simply holding a meaningful expression for a long, lingering moment so its effect could be felt and not just seen. i kept thinking to myself, how did this modern actress get into a creaky silent film? she was just years and years ahead of her time.the story isn't all that interesting, it is the usual tale of love found and lost. it is only the performance of garbo as leonora, the poor village girl who makes good in the big city and then returns to get the man who got away, that gives it life. co-star ricardo cortez is serviceable, but his character is never really developed and he is demeaned by the script throughout. at one point he is made to wear garbo's clothes, leave in a huff, then ignominiously return and give them back. and let's not even talk about his horrible final scenes with garbo and then his wife. way too ordinary, he didn't have much of a career after this and i can understand why. but he suffices as the somewhat mystifying object of leonora's obsession.there is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all. "leonora, you are becoming conspicuous." yes, conspicuous indeed.if you really want to know what it's all about without seeing the whole film, just watch the last 30 seconds or so - garbo's glance as she sits quite alone in her luxurious car says everything. "she must be so happy, she has everything she wants" - yes, garbo's face says it all about that. i have to see this one again, garbo is just amazing.

i was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses. this paramount has a mighty wurlitzer' organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day.we were fortunate enough to have dennis james, a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film. the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen.this was greta garbo's first american film. she was only 20 years old but already had 6 swedish films in her repertoire.it is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene, it was necessary to leave much to the imagination.modern audiences, for the most part, do not understand silent films acting was different then, with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy' and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period.garbo, with all her subtlety, did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug. she exemplifies the truism that `a picture is worth a thousand words.'even though this is garbo's first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: this was mgm filmmaking at its best. the sets and costumes were magnificent. the special effects  which by today's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing.the script by vicente blasco ibanez (from the novel by entre naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for garbo; it showcases her strengths, magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part.her co-star was mgm's answer to rudolph valentino: ricardo cortez. he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive, appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully.there are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo. notable among them are lucien littlefield as cupido' and martha mattox as doña bernarda brull.'this is when the extraordinary cinematographer, william h. daniels, met garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. (he was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: the divine garbo. without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was.seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance, do not miss it.

this is probably one of the worst movies ever made. it's...terrible. but it's so good! it's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. however, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goro's fantastic hair/bad english, you're in for a real treat. the harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead. i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans. and even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because goro's japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (he wasn't really, not when johnny kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).

after tracking it down for half a year, i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing.not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro. but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such. in his respectable self now, i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.man, i still can't believe he made this movie...i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....but i'm glad to have watched it. thank goodness he has grown up....

without a doubt, private lessons ii is the greatest movie i have ever seen. a japanese import (poorly) translated into english, its a joy to watch. not much of it makes sense, but that doesn't matter. it's the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny.the film is rare and unavailable on video, but i have caught it a couple of time late, late at night on pay cable. my taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as i slowly, person-by-person, introduce this film gem to the world.joanna pacula plays the tutor/lover to ken, our hero. (she apparently was just working for her check.) ken is played by goro inagaki, of the japanese pop band smap, who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie. stacy edwards, of "in the company of men" fame, shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards.it takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is. on repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases ken has in his house (at least 50) or that ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie's finale.the movie is predictable, but highly quotable. my friends and i reenact entire scenes. yes, it sounds like we're lame losers and we are ... but we're lame losers who have seen "private lessons ii." be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie. you'll thank me for it.

recap: zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with thierry. thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way. he has submerged himself in work, laid of his writing, and zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them. into this enters johnny, and old friend of thierry's who once were artists in exile together. but johnny has kept on painting, and just have a day job for the rent. he takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny. there is an instant raw attraction between zandalee and johnny, and they enter into an affair. but zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband. but none of them, not zandalee, not johnny and not thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control.comments: it is set as a thriller. but maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it's about life and death, and threat of violence. not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. and it is not really until the second half in zandalee until the thriller emerges, and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half, i can't really describe the genre as a thriller then. much more of a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. the developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind. because that is what it is all about, what drives the characters and therefore the entire story. desire. the need to have, and the need to be.in my opinion it is quite good, definitely a lot better than its current (4.1) rating anyway. it takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense, and it handles the erotic part very well, with taste. it is always an integral part of the story, needed to be there to give the story it's needed weight, and i never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that. but unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself feels kind of flat, even if in its own way kind of dramatic.the cast is impressive, spearheaded by known actors like nicholas cage and judge reinhold. but the show is almost completely stolen by erika anderson. beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she excels were both cage and reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough. her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in zandalee, i can only hope it is because of her own choices. also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie, it is steve buscemi and joe pantoliano.when you're in the right mood this is a very good movie, it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves.7/10

bored and unhappy young babe zandalee (a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout erika anderson) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent, yet dull businessman thierry martin (a solid and credible portrayal by judge reinhold). zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist johnny collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by nicolas cage). can the relationship between thierry and zandalee be salvaged? or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? director sam pillsbury and screenwriter mari kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. the dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: "i wanna shake you naked and eat you alive"). better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (johnny and zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). the tart'n'tangy new orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. with his long, scruffy black hair, greasy mustache, foul mouth, and coarse manners, cage's johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing "romantic" lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. the cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: anderson, cage and reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from joe pantoliano as zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend gerri, viveca lindfors as theirry's wise, perceptive mother tatta, aaron neville as friendly bartender jack, and steve buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief. walt lloyd's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. the flavorsome, harmonic score by pray for rain likewise hits the spot. a delightfully campy and seamy riot.

new york i love you is full of love and power. not for everybody, however, but is a beautiful movie.it has the likes of shia labeouf (seen in transformers, disturbia, charlies angels, i robot, indiana jones, and many more), maggie q, kevin bacon, blake lively, natalie portman, and many more. with a star-studded cast, this movie is without a doubt, brilliant.from many top-notch directors around the world, it does not fail to impress. the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique.it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie, and should be watched on a big tv! this time, trust the imdb rating, because it is an excellent film.eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010. watch ny ily, you won't be disappointed.

i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent.new york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever, funny, and sometimes shocking situations around the human race's most powerful emotion.the cast is huge, a veritable oceans 11 with andy garcia, ethan hawke, shia labouf, natalie portman, bradley cooper and others. they all give stand out performances in one way or another.that's not to mention that there is a who's who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways. brett rattner, shaka kapur, natalie portman, i mean -wow! this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny. it also has serious stories and notes. but that's good in my opinion. go see it for yourself and reply to my review, i want to hear what others have to say.

i just saw a press screening of this film and i was pleasantly surprised. not often is it that i get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time.i really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see rachael bilson and hayden back together. i think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera. my favorite scene was by far (surprisingly so) bret ratner's piece... without giving too much away, i'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging...the old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. both the chris cooper and the ethan hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that i've had in the big apple. over all the film is a great place to take a date... especially if you're already fond of the city itself.i can't wait for the next in the cities of love.

as a fan of paris je'taime, i went to see new york, i love you with very high expectations. i gladly walked out with all my expectations met. it was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. the film starts out with two cab hoppers (bradley cooper & justin bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. that was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits i have ever seen anywhere. there were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. those four i will start talking about. one features shia labeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. the next one features orlando bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by christina ricci. another one features anton yelchin and olivia thirbly as two people going to prom, thirbly's character being handicapped. the best one features eli wallach and cloris leachman as a bickering old couple. i will bring to your attention that nataile portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and ethan hawke and maggie q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. new york, i love you is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 paris je'taime. the skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. the film, however, does not have as many famous directors as paris je'taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. if you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see new york, i love you.

new york i love you just like its predecessor (paris je t'aime) is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter. the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes. new york, i love you offers a first class cast, featuring such great actors like shia labeouf, natalie portman, ian mckellen, hayden christensen, chistina rcci and orlando bloom, ethan hawke, james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella.

if you're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation. what i love is the ongoing surprises. it's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in 'new york i love you' to be continue. yeah, some of the short films makes you curious, some of them very short, some of them longer, some of them has it definite ends, some of them don't.most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city. it shows many different nationality background. many of it, make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries. this movie explore many type of things you might have known, but for all the characters it's a new things. maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home. you might want to reliving it again, by watching this.

i saw 'new york: i love you' today and loved it! i was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'paris je t'aime' and overall i think i liked this one much better... perhaps i need to watch 'paris je t'aime' again i don't know... i read few of the reviews here about ny:ily and yes, the movie is not without its faults. when you're paying tribute to a city like new york - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice... so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings, i'll just write about what i liked.unlike 'paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled, ny:ily isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing. i thought otherwise. i loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and i especially liked the overlapping of characters - it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now. but i still liked it because i didn't find it forced. and the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful, even whimsical quality to it - which some might find corny but i find beautiful.i liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by yvan attal with robin wright penn and chris cooper. it was so well-acted and scripted that the reveal in the end - again not unused in the past - brought me to tears and i was crying throughout the segment that followed. i always liked wright penn and now i'm also a fan of chris cooper. those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant, just before he gets the call - speak volumes about cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything.most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4-5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time. it seemed to me (and i might be wrong) that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point, the need even, to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time; to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time.the other films that i liked were the ones by shunji iwai with orlando bloom and christina ricci, by natalie portman with carlos acosta and taylor geare, by brett ratner with anton yelchin and olivia thirlby, by shekhar kapur with julie christie, shia labeouf and john hurt and once again the one by yvan attal with ethan hawke and emilie ohana when they're in the café. i really need to see more work by yvan attal as i seem to like him a lot! overall, watch this movie with an open mind. don't read the reviews before watching it! it might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in new york should be and i doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful landscape cinematography, some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings.

new york, i love you finally makes it to our shores, but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar new year, and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan (no, not the spy next door) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success. so why fix a formula that hasn't been broken?continuing in concept where paris, je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise (shanghai will be next, so says the end of the closing credits here), the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least.structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in paris.one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. and what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, or as a support to build upon. you can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from irrfan khan to natalie portman (who also had writing and directing duties), rachel bilson (looking quite like bardot) to spielberg's blue eye boy shia labeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date.story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. but these 10 stories plus 1 (because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more "anything goes" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (elijah wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), or even less adventurous with its narrative style (christopher doyle's, and tom tykwer's starring natalie portman). here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment.minor quibbles aside, i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here, contrary to what many others have felt about it. the short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup. i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore, i love you, so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. otherwise there's always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.

i'm not a writer or an critic...i'm just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago....and i want to thank people that worked on creating this movie!it is not the best or the most.... but it touched my heart...why???i would like to understand it myself...it is easy and accessible..it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it!it is about love and caring, about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff .......look at all the time that we have but we miss it....why a fu*k do we do that???we need to live like were dying ...care about every second and remember:if we do good things-good things come back to us!happiness is real...and it has a special taste in new york...i love this town and the world the we live in!!!!thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(english is my second language)...

as it is generally known,anthology films don't fare very well with american audiences (i guess they prefer one standard plot line). new york,i love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. the first was 'paris,j'taime', which i really enjoyed. the film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were french,but there is a very funny segment directed by joel & ethan coen). like 'paris', this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (fatih akin,mira nair,natalie portman,shakher kapur,etc.),and also like 'paris'deals with new yorkers,and why they love the city they live in. it features a top notch cast,featuring the likes of natalie portman,shia labeouf,christina ricci,orlando bloom,ethan hawki,and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan,cloris leachman,eli wallach and julie christie. some of the stories really fly,and others don't (although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes---i won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn't). word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai, china (is rome,italy,berlin,germany or athens,greece out of the question?). spoken mainly in english,but does have bits of yiddish & russian with english subtitles. rated 'r'by the mpaa for strong language & sexual content

new york, i love you is a collective work of eleven short films, with each segment running around 10 minutes long. the shorts don't exactly relate but they all have something in common, love. every short is about finding love, either if it's about a couple or just two strangers chitchatting.the film stars an ensemble cast, among them shia labeouf, natalie portman, hayden christensen, orlando bloom, chris cooper, andy garcia, christina ricci, irrfan khan, robin wright penn, julie christie, ethan hawke, bradley cooper, rachel bilson, and anton yelchin. with such a stellar cast and such an interesting premise, i was expecting a tremendous film; the problem is new york i love you doesn't add up. it remains the sum of its parts. some of the segments are funny, original and interesting but others are so meaningless (orlando bloom/christina ricci and ethan hawke/maggie q segments) that it's appalling. the film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. story-wise, it seems like something a few film students could put together. having said that, the film has some great moments as well, one of the best being the segment about an old couple, played by eli wallach and cloris leachman, walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. and it's moments like this, that made me as a viewer, wish the film was more consistent, because, there's a lot of potential here. but, as unsatisfying as the overall story ends up being, for me, the cinematography and soundtrack saved the all thing. the editing was perfect, the way the film was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack, couldn't be more fitting. in the end, new york i love you feels like an experimental film, and as in most experiences there's highs and lows. it's how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine if he enjoys it or not. it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others.7/10

i cannot say this movie is a disappointment because i read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as i thought it would have. the bar was not set that high, so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much.the good: the city of new york. if you live in the city like me, you'll recognize certain places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just a setting, rather one of the main characters. there are genuinely tender moments, humorous conversations, and plot twists left and right which all keep things interesting.the bad: the first thing i thought after leaving the theater was that i wanted more, but not in the positive "leave them wanting more" fashion. certainly the good skits/scenes outweigh the bad, but there are a lot of skits that fall within the "in-between" category, too many in fact, which is what ultimately brings the movie down. also, new york city's diversity, though hinted at though the many distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation throughout the movie, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing the city justice. for example, many of the skits involve well to do middle aged whites. i mean i know the city is home to many of the said demographic but come on, paris je'taime's plot and character diversity makes new york city look like lancaster, pa, or someplace really white. it is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that.still, even after having said this, i would recommend giving new york, i love you a view. who knows, maybe you'll disagree with my opinion and maybe you won't. you will never know until you see it for yourself. this review is not meant to deter anyone from watching this movie, as everyone's opinion on art differs. i'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect.

first of all i need to say that i'm portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies, probably one each year or even none......and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful, really close to the worst ever made! however, in the last decade, it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when "leão da estrela" e "costa do castelo" were among the worlds best of their time, with movies like "pulsação zero" or "sorte nula", both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common.this one is also good, not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy; in fact it's officially a drama, a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts, cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid. the plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine, the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema, that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix.if you want to watch a portuguese movie, surely you can take better option, but it stills one to be measured.

while this movie isn't a classic by any stretch, it is very entertaining as i remember it. i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie. it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed "arthur" and though it isn't as funny as that movie, it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with "arthur".

...i saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986. i saw this on vhs in a 'for sale' bin and bought it.in 1998, i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that wouldn't understand us, the travel, the heartbreak, etc. ). henry winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively. a great way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time. plus, look at the cast...william daniels ( knight rider ), polly holiday ( alice ), and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr. if you get a chance, watch it.

i saw the film twice in the space of one week, both times the at a cinema in orpington, kent, uk. the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. from the start of the film with henry winkler getting 'injured' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits.for those who love american wrestling this film is a must, but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before. also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but!if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best!

well i guess it supposedly not a classic because there are only a few easily recognizable faces, but i personally think it is... it's a very beautiful sweet movie, henry winkler did a great job with his character and it really impressed me.

the one and only was a great film. i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv. i am an independent professional wrestler, and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. now this film was made 4 years before i was born, but i don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. sad, funny, and all around great!!! **** 10+

this movie is a perfect example of a film that divides people into 2 groups.. those who get the joke and those who don't. people usually attack what they don't understand. this film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since. it's a great comedy.. and a great romance. it's a perfect date movie. a perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh. and if your perspective is too tense, maybe this movie isn't for you, and you may need counseling. it is an injustice that paramount has kept this film on the shelf since the early 80's, having never seen the light of day on dvd. yet they feel an urban version of "the honeymooners" is a good idea. i find it odd that my two alltime favorite romantic comedies have never been released on dvd. the other being gene wilder's "the world's greatest lover" which fox has sat on since the early 80's as well... yet, "from justin to kelly" is in nearly every video store in the country. there is no justice in the world. maybe those who took the time to bash this will enjoy "from justin to kelly", i'm sure that one is watered enough for them to "get". sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor... or sometimes it just goes stale and they find comic satisfaction in reruns of "full house".

what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on? and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal.but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense. you can see real people behind the unreal lines. and the directing is wonderful. each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long.i showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie. the friends enjoyed it too.

a critical and financial flop when first release, the critics have turned around and stated that this film ison of the director's best. a la ronde like feel to the film quickly develops as the guys from a detective agency (ben gazzara, john ritter and blaine novak) persue, fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful women seen on film (audrey hepburn, colleen camp, dorothy stratten and patti hansen). much of the script was ad-libbed or re-written on the day of shooting which gives the film a breezy feel. ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn after dropping singer colleen camp and seeing cab-driver patti hansen on the side. john ritter ineptly follows dorothy stratten and immediately falls in love with her. blaine novak has a few girls he is chasing (including joyce hyser and elizabeth pena). this film has some great performances by a supurb cast. standouts are audrey hepburn (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the film). ben gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and colleen camp has one of her best roles as the manic country singer christy miller. she is a delight to watch as she fires off her lines in a rat-a-tat-tat delivery. highly recommended! ********* stars!

bogdonovich's (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other. a film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and "true" geography, perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen. john ritter reminds us that with good directors (bogdanovich, blake edwards, billy bob) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em. one of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of bogdanovich's fertile after- "success" career, when his best work was truly done ("saint jack", "at long last...", "noises off".

sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty. and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of. if not his best, it's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies.this unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is (or should be) about: love, lost (or failure) and hope and faith and charity. as the song from whom the films takes its title (gershwin's well known composition) the film makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction (the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters --with that "bogdanovich touch" based on the point-of-view-- is a class on cinema language, something that p.b. learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies). with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack (including the best of sinatra's "trilogy"), this movie, full of self-consciousness and compassion, and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness (as some critics wrote), deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed. it's not "long on style, short on substance": it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

i am glad other people enjoyed this movie, cause i know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office. i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why - bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches, the cast (especially coleen camp) is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film. you've seen worse movies!

new york has never looked so good! and neither has anyone in this movie. while the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it. you almost wish people like this really existed. the appeal of the actors are what really put it over(john ritter, colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good.) go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did.

this is the weepy that beaches never was. as much as i wanted to love beaches, it always seemed too hurried for me to "feel" for it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though). stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower (and occasionally too slow) pace and though it's somewhat manipulative in its tears-inducing tale about a self-sacrificial mother, it works because bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances. 10/10

the original with barbara stanwyk is saved only by stanwyk's performance. the story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today. bette midler's version is much more interesting. she is stella claire, an independent, free-spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend (stephen collins) or her friend (john goodman in an underrated performance). she raises her daughter jenny played so sweetly by trini alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life-altering decision. through out the film, there are plenty of laughs, tears and memorable moments mostly between midler and alvarado. marsha mason co-stars as jenny's would-be stepmother, who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her. if you like midler, goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you'll enjoy bette midler's version of stella.

first off, i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler's i am. stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (bette midler, john goodman, trini alvarado, stephen collins, marsha mason) this is one of my favorite films of all time. it deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado. this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it. roger ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars! and it deserved 4! wonderful! i give it 4 out of 4!

peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films, and they all laughed is one of his best. the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy. interestingly enough, the witty, light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. there's no soundtrack music to cue us. we meet the characters in action, and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york, the film unfolds effortlessly. robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't. the cast is terrific. in every way, a classic.

i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but, other than his, i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions, love, and sacrifice (three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common).here the major theme is class division. stella is a story from depression era america. that said, it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake (if you ask a stanwyck fan or two) was not exactly appreciated. fans of the original never gave it a chance. furthermore, this version of stella was made in the 1990s, not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america (as the depression was).now is the time to remove the rosy-coloured glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america, and see that this powerful story still rings true, is as timely and relevant as ever, in its updated format.yes, class divide is the major theme here. stella is among the working poor, single, with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams. she works in a bar, doesn't have much money, lives in a crummy apartment. you get the drift. in the morning, she doesn't really want to get out of bed. on her wall, pictures of movie stars she idolizes.a man sees her dance at the bar. he's wealthy, educated, from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stella's. his major concern is what ivy league college to attend, her's is how to pay the rent, how to be 'happy.' they have an affair. they like each other. stella ends up pregnant. stella tells the guy the news. his response? "how about an abortion?" she replies, "i just wanted a room full of balloons." he supplies the balloons, and the proposal, but she sees his heart is not in it, and has too much pride to accept. she sends him packing.her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles--the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father. stella, alone and unloved, and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday, makes the ultimate sacrifice. she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter, and perhaps live vicariously, and with hope, knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for.now, for the movie. everything is right about it. beautiful score, artful cinematography, great set design (contrast between the two lifestyles; the messy apt. and the decorated mansions), wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast, with bette midler, in particular, oscar-worthy.this is a film which is much more significant and well-made than you've been led to believe.

with various bogdanoviches and gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew "they all laughed" is very much a family affair.if you add the fact that b.gazzara and miss a.hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.if this all smacks of smug "in - joke" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that mr bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "i love n.y." paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late miss hepburn. make no mistake this is her picture.mr gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. the plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. mr bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from "targets" onwards.there is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.miss hepburn in particular benefits from this love. extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally "who the hell's in it?", recently remaindered in uk bookstores. the soundtrack to "they all laughed" varies from louis armstrong's 1947 new york town hall concert to sinatra to country to latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. mr b,s "golden boy" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes "they all laughed" will be recognised for the fine work that it is.

'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star turns from ben gazzara, and the late john ritter who is superb. and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn. the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties, film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak(the films co-producer) and john ritter, basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife(hepburn) and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production, 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans.

this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world. john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie! "sam" hits close to home, is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with. ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with. i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere. all around, an excellent choice to pick up any evening.!:-)

since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. the blurb i wrote for amazon is below, and i'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on dvd on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.the last credit in this film explains its appeal - "thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed." a charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to new yorkers (peter bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (west 12th street, the ansonia, the old fao schwartz, the plaza, the roxy, chez brigitte, and city limits which was a country & western club). one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. i laughed, i cried, it was better than cats. not only an ode to dorothy stratten, it was also audrey hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love.

i watched it some years ago. i remembered it as very mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholic things, like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich.i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more. nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version, at any price, please!the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second, a bit of blueish, but also happy.all the characters are great to me, with funny situations, great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs. this may not be casualty.i think that the title is a hope about life! you have to be happy and laugh as much as possiblei know that this may be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is that i like it very much, i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it.

screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city. peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture--he reveres them--yet audrey hepburn is (naturally) put a notch above the others because, after all, she's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior. he shoots her in loving close-ups, gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ben gazzara, and allows her room to sparkle throughout. the love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing, though i did tire of john ritter's tv-styled klutziness. colleen camp, dorothy stratten, and the grounded, earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch. but it's really hepburn's valentine and she absolutely glows. *** from ****

well, i had seen "they all laughed" when it came out ineurope around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it. i 've just seen it again on tape, almost twenty years after... bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also. excellent comedians and actors, good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing, too. i laughed and smiled all the time. just as we all do, at times. go get it.

"they all laughed" is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much. bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. but, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and "tal" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. it is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: colleen camp's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog; blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says, "how...weird." it's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face.

based on a true story, this series is a gem within its kind. the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village.in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil, the diamond commender--appointed by the king of portugal--is the ultimate authority. having grown up in the relative security of his house, the young and beautiful xica da silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town, refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter. in a desperate bid to save herself, xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king, intending to use them to escape. the king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day, however, and when the loot turns up missing, the diamond commender is led away in chains, his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs. martin, the diamond commender's son, swears vengeance. xica and the other slaves, however, are sold at auction, and xica ends up in the home of the sergeant major, an old man who bought her solely to slake his lust. to the town of tijuco, however, comes the new diamond commender, the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes. immediately struck by xica's beauty, he manipulates the sergeant major into selling her to him. and thus begins a love story, filled with danger, intrigue and passion, between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen.the series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute. at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of suspense and unexpected twists. "xica da silva" is definitely a must. i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd.

i am black american and i loved this soap opera. i watched it dubbed in spanish on telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. the story was a true story about a black slave who's love affair with a white commander led to her leadership and candid, whimsical way of living.a lot of us could learn a lot from xica. she took what she had, nothing, and saw her possibilities. many would argue that she sold herself out - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children.it was such an excellent soap opera, that i thought it would be released on dvd, but it's not being released. this soap opera was the best soap opera ever. we need for it to be released on dvd or broadcast on tv again. it's playing on azteca america right now, which is only available in mexico or in the us by paid cable. we need it released again to telemundo.

this show is a great history story. it's has everything from slavery,the way they were treated, religion, the ways jews were sent into hiding,the inquisition, the belief in the orisha the african gods, the way women were treated,including the daughters. even down to homosexuality. the way the characters are intertwined and that violante, that character saddens me. she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.i am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v. again. although i would love to see the unedited version. xica has become my heroine. i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it. i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century. i look forward to my xica every night. it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too.

let's face it: the final season (#8) was one of the worst seasons in any show i've ever enjoyed (mostly, i've never found dry spells to last a whole season). but if you judge this show by the last season, of course it's going to come across as inferior. that is an entirely unfair assessment-- because "that '70s show" was, in its day, a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times.all right... ignoring season 8.topher grace stars as eric forman, a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna (laura prepon), the feminist girl next door. playing their friends, danny masterson (hyde), mila kunis (jackie), wilmer valderrama (fez) and even ashton kutcher (kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. the best one is probably fez, a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. what country is he from? try to figure it out! for another dimension of entertainment, debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as eric's parents. rupp, as kitty, is both formidable and sweet, sort of like mrs. brady meets marie barone, while smith's red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone. don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donna's parents, the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge. tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure to hyde.apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come (and that deplorable final season), "'70s" is a terrific show with amazing writing, spot-on direction, and a feel-good vibe pulsing through every episode. they're all alright.

in what is a truly diverse cast, this show hits it's stride on fox. it is the kind of sitcom that grows on you. if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much, but once you watch two or three- you get hooked.this is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them. as is usual today, the themes are very mature. the humor is usually very mature too. often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones.red (kurtwood smith) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show. debra jo rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too. danny masterson, the oldest actor of the "kids" is very good too. laura prepon (donna) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead (who got the idea of making her a blonde?). she shows very good talent & comedic timing often. she looks good without make up too.this is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department & it's most successful live action one since married with children

if any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun. filled with heart and laughs, this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. the furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and the even the drugs were tolerable. the hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by roller-skates, and in the words of merle haggard, "a joint was a bad place to be". take a trip back to the greatest time in american history. fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other. this classic is on television as much as "full house". don't miss it, and always remember to "shake your groove thing!!!"

this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television. season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons. the only reason that i give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season. the only good part of the final season was the finale. my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people's imaginations, often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70's. it is a rare show in that i liked every character (with the exception of the final season...too late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny). red's foot in your ass comments never got old, nor did kelso's stupidity. bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long, too long even.

that 70s show is the best tv show ever, period. it's up there with the andy griffen show, saturday night live, and the simpsons in my book. that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons, all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships, separating from their parents, and their overall futures.the two main characters, eric and donna, are two teenagers living next door to each other. they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives, and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.two other characters, red and kitty, are eric's parents. red was in the service, so he really pushes eric around. kitty is just the opposite. even though she drinks heavily, she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care. bob, their neighbor, is obviously donna's dad. bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story. bob also annoys red to his full extent.the remaining character, hyde, kelso, fez, and jackie, are eric's friends. they also play a major role in the show's story.well, the first season is great. this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other. the first season is original, funny, and enjoyable.the second season is good, although it isn't as good as the first. it is a basic continuation of the first. eric and donna are together, and everything is working out great.the third season is my favorite. it went back and captured the first season feel and humor. i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch, making the show all that more fun to watch.the fourth season isn't near as good. eric and donna arne't together in this one, making the show slightly less pleasurable. it is still funny, although i didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through. it is the gang's senior year, so that really helps with the story. the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.the sixth season is good for the most part. it is extremely funny, although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did. the gang is out of high school, so i believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did. i also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them.the seventh season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way, although it didn't do it all the way. i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others, and the ending is great.the last season flat out sucked. eric wasn't in it, which ruined it. kelso wasn't in it for the most part either, which didn't help. i hated the eighth season up until the last episode. i thought that the last episode was really good, and a fitting ending to the series.so overall, if you enjoy comedy, give that 70s show a try. they stopped making new episodes, but it is still on tv a bunch. i also recommend buying seasons 1-7. it is up to you if you want to buy season 8.

if tv was a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! with an excellent cast, and a perfect plot, this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to tv after dinner. with the constant changing of relationships and finding out who hyde's real dad is, this show was a hit when it started in august of 98, though it was set in 1976. and hanging out in foremans basement was always the thing to do back then, and it still is today, along with circles.this show gave great laughs in premieres, and it still does during re-runs. if you watch a few episodes of this show, you will get everything and want to get more. now only is this show one of the best ever created, it is clever and funny.

this show is wonderful. it has some of the best writing i ever seen. it has brilliant directing by dvid trainer who also directed another smart television series called boy meets world.this show is with out a dought one of the greatest. like three's company, roseanne, and the famous cosby show this will be on television for a long time to come.from it's perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't. this show appeals to the young and the young at heart. a perfect show.

i love this show. period. i haven't been watching very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while. i love all of the characters, except i don't really care for donna. i'm not completely sure why. i just..don't find her funny, and i don't think laura prepon is a very good actress. other than her, i find the rest of the cast pretty good. kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp, who played erics parents, were extremely funny. topher grace is also a great actor. unlike a lot of fans, i did not completely hate the 8th season. i still watch it, and it does make me laugh. but, if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons, its..not good. randy is horrible. the finale was decent, nothing amazing, but good. =] i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave, but oh well. i have the fourth season on dvd, and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd. some of its most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'dine&dash', 'grandmas dead', 'red&stacey', and 'streaking', but i love every episode i've seen so far, which is most of them, i think. =] 9/10 stars, i would definitely recommend it. =]

not since the simpsons made it's debut has there been a sitcom that i didn't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes. it has of course been said that the simpsons killed the sitcom. not this one though.the first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became. they even went to school sometimes. the following seasons the character where fledged out. eric, the sarcastic twit, donna, his levelheaded girlfriend, kelso, the dim bulb, hyde, the conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, fez, the pervert exchange student and finally jackie, the spoiled rich floozy. as for the adult characters there was eric's mom, the "can you believe she is so ditzy" suburban mom, eric's dad, the straight arrow who of course wasn't such a hard ass as he seemed, donna's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom. everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to kurtwood smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his red forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.topher grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good. it's a tough character to play because it doesn't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the kelso character, played competently by ashton kutcher. i enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although i will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.jackie, played by family guy voice artist mila kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice, which actually fits her character. the only sad part is that we didn't see more scenes with her and eric because they were f...... hilarious together. too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with eric and donna.last i will say that the casting of guest actors were always great. a few favorites: fez' humongous girlfriend in the mid-seasons, pastor dan, the totally awesome leo played by the equally awesome thomas chong, another one of fez' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.coming up next on fox, whatever.

i absolutely loved this soap. it has been one of my favorite. will highly recommend :)... i just love brazilian soaps, they deal with real life events. i'm really sad that the soap ended but i'm sure i'll be able to find it somewhere. for those of you who have not seen it, please see it. i loved the characters, the plot and how things turned out in the end for the villains. the only thing i would have changed is the end for xica and her long life love. i can't wait to see it again and highly recommend it. xica has been by far, the best soap i have ever seen. forget everything else :)go xica.. hope you all like it as well.

i haven't liked many tv shows post 1990, but that 70s show is great. never seeing it during it's first run, thinking a gimmicky period piece, i was wrong! i started watching in reruns and the more i watched, the more i liked! now, it is the only show premiering post-1990 that i watch regularly.although that 70s show mimics some of the styles, attitudes, music, and tastes of the 70s, it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s. it contains so much funny, witty, biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichés by just being humorous. the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable.although a hilarious sitcom, no matter what time period, the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity. but its the focus on universal issues (family problems, teen angst, marital issues, peer pressure), dealing with all of them with comic aplomb, that gives the show a mass appeal.the show's center is one eric forman (played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace). eric is a super-skinny, geeky-looking, non-athletic teen and still comes off as super-cool due to grace's brilliant self-deprecation of the character. eric has 5 friends donna, hyde, kelso, jackie, and fez (played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon, danny masterson, ashton kutcher, mila kunis, and wilmer valderama). we get to see life in point place, wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see! donna, a forward-thinking feminist, is the object of eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show. they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple. most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend, which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity. hyde is eric's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him; hyde is the mellow, zen, cool one of the group and just sits back, observes, and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb. kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt, displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever! jackie, who starts out as kelso's girlfriend, is a verbose, self-absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b/c of kelso, but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her! and finally, fez! fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country (we never know exactly where) and he is a scene-stealer! "i said good day!" "you son of a b*tch!" valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen. his scene-stealing moments often help make the show for me.the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be. the gang repeatedly gets into trouble (most of it on purpose). they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other. they hang out most of the time in eric's basement plotting, pontificating, or just plain playing around.also figuring prominently in the show are eric's parents, the menacing, commie-hating red and the lovable, happy-go-lucky kitty (played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp). these 2 adults give the show a much-needed mature point-of-view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do-wells. red and kitty are ably supported by donna's parents, the buffoonish bob (played wonderfully for the full run by don stark) and blonde bimbo daft midge (the super-sexy tanya roberts, who was on the show for about half it's run). additionally, for 3 full seasons, eric's sister from hell laurie (played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah-fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents' sides! kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps. but, unfortunately, kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6. the newbie didn't last, thankfully, and was gone after a few season 6 eps!sadly, at the end of season 7, topher grace (eric) and early in season 8, ashton kutcher (kelso) left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it's last. grace and kutcher returned for the series finale, though, giving the show a satisfying end. a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor. top notch supporting players were eternally high leo (played to the hilt by tommy chong), pastor dave, roy (the terrific comic jim gaffigan), big rhonda, mitch, earl, etc. they also got legends marion ross (happy days) and betty white (the mary tyler moore show) to play red and kitty's mothers, respectively. many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well, from shirley jones (partridge family) to pamela sue martin (nancy drew) to charo to ted nugent to k.i.s.s! it goes on and on!with great nostalgic 70s homages and references, hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical, take-no-prisoners style of comedic storytelling, that 70s show is a television classic!

i saw this show about 3-4 years ago. it was dam funny! when i first time i saw it was playing on etv(estonian television) and i started to like it. too bad that that show is on bad time for me. hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing frank sinatra! and he comes on stupid ideas. he got these glasses which h are brown. i like it . and there's fez. the group pervert. we all know what he does when his alone..... he wants to get laid badly. he even had it with his boss in one episode.his from india. and there is michael , the stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop! he is so stupid that i remember follows: hyde says: did u called cops ? - no michael comes in and says. does anyone know how to turn off siren? he is a town playboy. then comes jackie , who is former girlfriend of michael and then she's hyde's girlfriend. then is eric who's son of grumpy war veteran and son of kitty the housewife. his one big pussy. but he loves donna , his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage. donna is one hot girl. hmm what i forget? ah hyde lives in a basement .

this show was absolutely great, and i always look forward to watching it.all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows.everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny, that you couldn't help but love this show.there were a few dead weight episodes, but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere, to where it just really didn't matter.this was one of the best shows to ever be aired, and i will watch this show anytime i can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never gets uninteresting.

im gonna make this short and sweet because i don't think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique, for me its possibly the funniest show ever.you have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out. for example the way hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.its all round classic i mean the cast, the writers, the director, its just a recipe for success. one actor i think who always gets a hard time is ashton kutcher but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character kelso to have been played by anyone else, it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid. all the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox mila kunis, now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show.

this show is freaking hilarious! the jokes are original, god and i love eric and kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show, and randy is a real dumbass. randy is, comparing to eric and kelso. you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with "i'm a cool guy" kind of guy (randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.the 360's are awesome, the circle, red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna. they're cool, but not without kelso and eric.great show. dumbass!

i wish "that '70s show" would come back on television. it was the greatest show ever!!! they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. but i wish it would come back and make more episodes. please come back... the show was absolutely hilarious. you couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when hyde and jackie were going out with each other. those were the best episodes. "that '70s show is the best".... it will be and always will be the best show ever. it was really sad when the show ended. they should make new episodes.

like the characters in this show, i too was a teen during the 70s. the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. the 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show.the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera. i really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences. no other show does camera tricks like this. these cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era.overall this is a very funny sitcom. the one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. in this way, i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children. while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show, keep trying to imitate it. i do recommend that 70s show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. it could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.

"that '70s show" is definitely the funniest show currently on tv. i started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show. i like all the characters, but my personal favorites are fez and kelso. leo was also an awesome character while he was there, i really hope he comes back because he's hilarious. it's classic when fez goes "you son of a bitch!", and when kelso yells "burn!", that always makes me laugh. they are both great characters and always have something funny to say. jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show; she started out being really good looking but damn, somewhere around season 5-6 she just got really hot. i've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there still hilarious. this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it. the cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where with many shows there are only a few funny characters. i will be sad to see this show end next year, but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever.

there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. that 70's show is a great example. when the show came on the air, nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character, eric, and his close circle of friends. ashton is already the john travolta of our time. remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough, think of ashton with demi moore. the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it. i miss mo gaffney who played don's girlfriend joanne. i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie, the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that. i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde. i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie's angels. i loved brooke shields playing jackie's mom. she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway. this show has been a delight with many surprises. i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they don't stay too far away too long. i wish the show's creators, bonnie and terry turner, who also created my other favorite show, third rock from the sun, is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show. the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future.

... and the series lets you forget all that. i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. born in 1958, i learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. the 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.the funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. it manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. then there are the parents. the two young lovers in the show - eric forman and donna pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. eric's parents, red and kitty, are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade. they represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. eric's friends fez, kelso, and jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbishness respectively. hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of eric.

xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever! the a black slave's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man's of the area love, in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal, that explored its diamonds. the largest xica enemy, violante, bride that it was changed by xica, is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything. very religious person, she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time, she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica, that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area. the story also bill with forbidden loves, sorceries and vampires and religious fervor. xica da silva does with that you don't want to lose a i only surrender, from beginning to end!

this show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. that's the only difference that it has with other tv comedies. i don't know how you can like this show. its humor is pathetic! i mean, the jokes are so direct... a typical dialog is this: "fez: oh, jackie i want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) jackie: fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) fez: oh yes i am. (audience cheers and applauds)" this isn't funny. i think that if it didn't have those laughs (i don't know how you call that in english, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. this isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. i like most of the american comedies, but this isn't good at all. i would give it 4 out of 10. (sorry for my poor english again.)

i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx. i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it. i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v. i loved the show so much!finally a show for everyone to enjoy. i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough. they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid, but not that 70s show. that 70s show was hilarious, smart and so real. i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended. although i love this show, i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave. the last season was just not right, eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one.

over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping "8 simple rules" going after john ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time i cared. the idea of having "that 70's show" without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous. they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore. it just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. the last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. they also brought in the standard cousin oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn't randy, please let it not be randy. the deal with randy was that he'd do really awful jokes, usually as red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches. i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused. the problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching "as the world turns". i'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from "family matters". to be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by topher grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.by the way, yet more criticism on season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme? not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), fez scared the hell out of me. dude, don't open your eyes that far. but the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.

how does an usual day start in point place, wisconsin...first of all, red, the tyrannical father of the forman family and a wwii veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife kitty serves breakfast. then comes their skinny son, eric, he sits at the table as well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot in eric's behind if (insert reason here). if his promiscuous angel-faced sister laurie is at home, she comes along, then red stops yelling and kindly talks to her, making eric feel left out of the family.once this daily (painful) ritual is over, eric rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. and when we get to see them, it becomes obvious eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend donna pinciotti are the sanest people around. meet steven hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around as long as it's not funny to watch; michael kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; jackie burkhardt, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader; and fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret. at first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.meanwhile red goes out and meets donna's weirdo parents, bob and midge. he's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking. somewhere around is leo, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters? of course, most seem "clichéd", but the show takes the cliché to a new level. now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer, sit down and enjoy one of the best tv shows ever. the one that never does two times the same thing and which is, compared to most sitcoms that are "cute funny", purely hysterical. if you get hooked, don't let this show let you go. bite on the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective.

i can't believe we don't have that 70's show anymore. i have all 8 seasons of that 70's show!! i absolutely love it!! i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep. at the end of a long busy day it's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep. i was so sad they took the show off air... at least we still have the re-runs!! i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion...like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married!!!! wouldn't that be awesome!!! it would be even better if they would continue it for several years!!

this was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. the actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. season 8 was the real problem kicked in. without topher grace or ashton kutcher the show simply fell apart. not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as danny masterson, wilder valderamma kurtwood smith, debra jo rupp, mila kunis and laura prepon ( don starks and tommy chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. and the inclusion of randy ( josh meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. i believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent. i am going to miss the show, i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as that 80's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it.

this show has come so far. at first everyone in the cast from eric to fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished. they stuck with the show and it was a success. its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i've ever seen in my life. it will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, i hope to god that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had. i don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode. go down swinging, get one last punch in. the show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on friends, and let the finale be huge. i say get donna and eric married, i say have hyde and kelso fight and become friends again, i say have something interesting happen between fez and jackie because fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him. just close out the series big time guys!that 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. eric, kelso, donna, jackie, fez, hyde, i wish i had you guys as friends. you are the best!10/10...

telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica! i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica! it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil. the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful. xica contains a lot of history of that time period. i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning. i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo. i've e-mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears. the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under 14 do not watch xica. overall xica merits a 10 out of 10!

endearing tale........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex... not all that much comedy (compared to a i almost wet myself movie) although funny enough. not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me, but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important. maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally? ahab no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie. really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, reminding you of what romance could and should be like, something to shoot for. my summary describes it best in very few words..... quite charming

i find this movie very enjoyable. the plot is simple and easily digestible, the humour is light and clean, and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common, i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out. turns out to be very nice. the performance of the female lead is admirable; her portrayal of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming. i also find vera's dancing very, very well done. i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly.for those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly.

a few years ago, i bought several $1 dvd's that contained two movies each. one of them had three broadway girls (an alternate title for the greeks had a word for them) and this one, happy go lovely. it's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaire's limousine. vera-ellen is that dancer and-wow, what legs! ceasar romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she's dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned. and david niven is that rich guy who, when looking for vera-ellen, is mistaken for a reporter who's supposed to interview her but gets stalled by romero. what i've just mentioned may be confusing but (mostly) makes sense if you're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms. vera-ellen. romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout. the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it's in public domain. and vera-ellen does pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress. so on that note, i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies.

i was having just about the worst day of my life. then i stumbled on this cute film, watched it, and now i'm ready to go out & kiss a streetlamp.i have to admit, i only watched it for 2 reasons: vera-ellen's legs. but it's really so much more. the plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. it's almost like a shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings. and of course there's also... vera-ellen's legs.the only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version i purchased (the "100 family classics" collection by mill creek entertainment) doesn't have the best video quality, and i've heard the same about the alpha release. the brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when vera is dancing in a white dress. but i suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your tv set to compensate. i can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in '51. the stage sets, costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy--sort of in a "cabinet of dr. caligari" vein.as far as the romance goes, this is just perfect. not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. just 100% ahhhhhh. too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. har har har. wait, what am i laughing at? my life sucks just as bad as yours. oh hell. time to watch this movie again.

went to see this finnish film and i've got to say that it is one of the better films i've seen this year. the intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town. the stories come together very nicely in the end, reminding, perhaps, a bit of the way tarantino's movies are made. most of the actors performed very well, which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type. i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala, the lead actress, and juha kukkonen. i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna. her name, as you might have noticed in my review ;), is not heikkilä, but hietala.

this is a top finnish film this year,although tango kabaree comes close.the director lampela made couple of years back another nice little film called rakastin epätoivoista naista (i was in love with a desperate woman).joki is truly true-to-life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village/town.the actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully.i certainly do hope that many of them get jussi statue (finnish oscar) next spring.i think this film could make it abroad as well.

i thought it was an extremely clever film. i was very pleased with it and truly couldn't' ask for more. i actually own the film because i didn't return it to someone... which i should do, but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it. also, the fact i don't own too many foreign films and this is a first. now, i personally love finnish stuff so, that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it. but overall, its worth watching. however, if you're not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit, then this film is not for you.9/10 for sure.

excellent movie, a realistic picture of contemporary finland, touching and profound. one of the best finnish films ever made. captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society. lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers. he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed. his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki.

half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in finland. these stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard. this indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time.the film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key. the film improves so stick with it. two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.while the various scenes of family life take place in finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live.collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama.

following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week, i'd say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately. especially the young-couple-with-a-baby-having-serious-issues phenomenon is very familiar to me, as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland. the relationships and problems of people, fragility of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the ascending money problem, all are very well put, without any subjectivity or exaggeration.there are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other, but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding. not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound, but as said above, the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of "real life" and captivate the viewer. i happen to think in a calm moment: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? well, this is what is happening. movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power. it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries, but it particularly reflects finland as it is, and pretty damn well.one comment about the acting: being the fan of finnish cinema i am, i've never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall. maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good try by the entire crew. i'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast..7,5 / 10

the finnish version of robert altman's "short cuts", set in the small rural town of äänekoski. the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. i was particularly impressed by two episodes. the first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the "routines" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). compared with altman's classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.

not a film to be taken seriously, but a great little film nonetheless.it's definitely not just a piece of fluff. the acting, imo, is excellent.one of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see, but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable. like an old friend.definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.- - - - - - - -

good work by everyone, from scriptwriters, director, and cast; a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only; a good film for television on those cloudy, cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy.

every scene was put together perfectly.this movie had a wonderful cast and crew. i mean, how can you have a bad movie with robert downey jr. in it,none have and ever will exist. he has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent.this movie was perfect! i saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in "blockbuster" and like it was calling out to me,i couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. you can call me a sappy romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. even though it made me cry,i admit, at the end, the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter.i suggested to my horror, action, and pure humor movie buff of a brother,who absolutely adored this movie. this is a movie with a good sense of feeling.it could make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love,and enjoy your life.every time you purposefully walk past this movie, just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie.who knows? what if it could really happen to you?, and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.

chances are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film. robert downey, jr. is excellent in this movie. his extra large eyes and wonderfully variable facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films. compare robert downey, jr. in chaplin. you will enjoy chances are. i did.

i've just seen this movie for the second time on television. it's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. i've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -cybill shepherd, ryan o'neal, robert downey,jr. and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves. masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping, when harry met sally, sleepless in seattle and the "high gimmick" sorts of movies like big, back to the future, peggy sue got married. i hate to say this, because this cast was superb and i'd never change any of them- but i think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan, tom hanks, michael j. fox, and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made. it's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. yet it's executed to perfection. the romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the "feeling" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. again and again, you will find yourself moved. actually, a comparable movie is made in heaven -the same romantic yearning.do see this - it's lovely.

i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it! i was very pleased with the movie... i thought it was a wonderful plot. it's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say! and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years!!! i thought it was a great movie!!

this isn't the best romantic comedy ever made, but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable. it's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine. cybill shepherd as corinne isn't bad in her role as the woman who can't get over her husband's death. she has a sexy maturity. but i can't say much for ryan o'neal as philip, because he is, at best, nondescript. he may be adequate in the role, but that's not good enough.however, i get the feeling that some of the characters, particularly alex and miranda, are not written with enough in-depth thought. we don't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick, and the writers don't tell us much beyond what happens. but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up, and robert downey jr. is so charming that he melts the screen. even his smile is infectious. and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way, why not give it a try.

people call this a comedy, but when i just watched it, i laughedonly once. i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was 14,and i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to betaken seriously. there were quite a few scenes that were meantto be funny, but i cared too much about the characters to laugh atthem.i suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love,and try to take it seriously. i think you'll find that, despite a few sillyflaws, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.

nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love. this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny mathis's song, or any song from that era: bobby darin's, beyond the sea... or stan getz's, the girl from ipanema, et al...i measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied... chances are had me back a few good times.i also watch the synergy between the cast... i thought they worked well together.open your heart, and let the comedic magic of film transport you.'alan

i don't think i could have enjoyed it more, though certain things were disturbing. i'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. at any rate, what movie can lack with robert downey jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? all-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. the characters were like-able, and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it. the idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. but like i said before, it's hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr.

ordinarily i really enjoy movies like "chances are," but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons. the first half was pretty well done overall, with alex finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body (played by robert downey jr.). he meets up with his wife (cybill shepherd) and friend (ryan o'neal) and his daughter, who is now grown up. the scenes with them meeting again and downey rediscovering who he once was are well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated, but from there the film goes downhill. there are several sex-related scenes that turned me off completely, especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now. after that, however, the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible, considering the circumstances of the plot. i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end. there was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven are well done. there is a good theme song sung by peter cetera and cher, but ultimately the film is not great. for a better, similar film, try "heaven can wait." decent, but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.*** out of ****

what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was! he could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end. you really want to know how things are going to work out.the script is perfect for cybill shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her "moonlighting" success for the new generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start. in this film she's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with "fried green tomatoes" two years later). she may have looked too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. this is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead.shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point. and there's ample support from ryan o'neal (in his best role in years) and christopher macdonald. masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own, either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word.ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same way he did with "dirty dancing", but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room. (use your best judgment, they're your parents after all.) i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well.again, credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze. (where are they now?) ardolino's next film would be the phoned-in sequel to "three men and a baby" but his final theatrical release (sister act) would finally give him the nine-figure-grossing smash hit he deserved. mr. ardolino, your cinematic touch is missed!

i've always been a big cybill shepperd fan, ever since i saw her series a few years ago!! this film certainly shows her in her best light yet!! the film was so wonderfully cast and played!! every now and again she drops little amusing lines, just to make this film one of the best i've ever seen!! everybody really out does themselves!! especially robert downey jr and cybill shepperd, they really made the film come true!! also i loved the little bit where mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor!! this is film at its best!!

another downey must-see! if you are an obsessed fan like me, you have got to see this movie! he plays alex finch, a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier. alex is the re-incarnation of louie jeffries, a no-nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine (cybil sheppard). louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car. he demands to go back, only this time in the body of alex finch. enter robert downey jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughs.although this movie is 15-years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation. and if so, how often to you meet the same souls life after life. i don't know the answer. but i do know that you need to see this movie. it is a riot, and downey looks so good in a tuxedo. this film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies. it just gets recycled.

yes, i'm sentimental & schmaltzy!! but this movie (and it's theme song) remain one of my all time greats!! robert downey jr. does such justice to the role of "louis jeffries" reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is romantic & makes one believe in happy endings!!

a charming romantic comedy. the plot is a little too complicated--i tried to summarize it three times and i can't. suffice to say it's worth seeing. the movie is funny, beautiful--the plot is totally unrealistic but it works. everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great--it creates a sweet, romantic feel through the entire film. the acting is great--robert downey jr. and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it. ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine. if you're a sucker for good, sweet sentimental films (like me), catch this one. also downey looks great in his underwear!extra bonuses--the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song "after all" sung by cher and peter cetera.

chances are is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (cybill shepherd) whose husband (christopher mcdonald) is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant. we then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. he is told he can return to earth but not as himself. flashforward 19 years where we see shepherd's daughter (mary stuart masterson) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man (robert downey jr.)who, it turns out is the reincarnation of her father. the film is a little on the predictable side...the story goes all the places you expect it to, but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially shepherd and downey) that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun. shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. a lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you.

writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in "chances are." using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife's home many years later, the plot takes unexpected, delightful turns.twenty four year old robert downey, jr. renders a delightful performance, ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend. this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper, playing off one another with a graceful style. i've watched this film a number of times on tv, and each time found it most enjoyable.

i was always a big fan of this movie, first of all have you seen the cast, the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well. cybill shepherd was given great reviews for her role, and they were well deserved. the beginning of this movie starts in the past when corinne jeffries (cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband louie dies unexpectedly. fortunately, louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be "recycled" back to earth as the newborn alex finch (robert downey, jr). alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while corinne tries to get on with hers. but fate crosses alexs path 23 years later when he meets corinne's daughter miranda (mary stuart masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins, and embarrassing situations occur.) the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute. you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance, chances are you'll like it. very funny and sweet!

if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years, then it would have to be "chalo di daar chalo chand ke paar chalo" for its meaning, the way it is sung by lata mangeshkar and mohd. rafi, the lyrics by kaif bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars. the other would have to be "chalte chalte." pakeezah was meena kumari's last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen. in each of the the songs that are picturised, she looks young but after that she does not. but one actor who didn't change in his looks was the late raj kumar, who falls in love with her and especially her feet, after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are.conclusion: pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs. the movie stars the meena kumari, raj kumar and ashok kumar and is directed by kamal amrohi.kamal amrohi's grandson has now started to revive his grand father's studio by making a comedy movie.

this film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks. then meena kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in. songs on all india radio, especially inhi logon ne were played so often that i was sick of them at the time, despite recognising their beauty! yes, it did take all those years to make. this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes, not surprising!! not only does meena kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to lata's voice. inhi logon ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re-recorded like chalo dildar chalo show clear development. i only wish someone would find the ghulam mohammad songs that weren't included in the film, because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them. lata in a recent interview (2007) rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with, apart from madan mohan (a great personal friend). notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the chalo dildar songs, very unusual. there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed meena kumari. kamal amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon. any other film, this song would have had close-ups of both of them.as for this being the finest film ever, i would beg to differ. it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema, in no particular order, films like barsaat (old), devdas (older versions), bandini, do bigha zameen, garam hava, dastak, guddi, aan, pyasa, kagaz ke phool, sahib bibi aur ghulam, kabuliwallah, abhimaan, guide, sujatha, bombay ka babu, daag, parineeta (old), umrao jaan, etc. etc. and if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from barsat ki raat to naya daur, teesri manzil, mahal, aag, jugnu, anand, mera naam joker: the list is really endless!so enjoy pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above...

such a film of beauty that it's hard to describe. maybe it's the absence of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it's the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it's just meena mumari's feet, but it's a joy to watch this movie again and again. i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it, and few from any country rival its perfection.

mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing, to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible. the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality. you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background:other girl dancing, a drunk falling down stairs, much activity, but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times, you didn't notice.all in all, perfection.j.q.

the ultimate homage to a great film actress.the film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen.like great poetry it is timeless.direction,cast,screenplay,music,lyrics,in fact all the norms for movie-making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film.the muslim society in india has never been presented with such respect,nobility and reality.the script is memorable in the hands of meena,ashok,raaj kumar,nadira etc to name a few.personally i was most impressed by the regal looking kamal kapoor.the master movie maker kamal amrohi's lasting legacy to the sub-continent.a very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world.'in ka naam? pakeeza! haan pakeza'.such acting is unheard of in this age of sex,dance and pornography.

this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay, fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch, an actually elegant romance (it's a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore), lovely songs and lyrics (especially the final song), an artistic score, and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them. the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there. definitely check this movie out-- over and over again. there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.

a great film requiring an acquired taste. if you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again i recommend this very highly. easily the best film produced in bollywood this century.the only other indian film i would give 10/10 for is dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge. even then it comes second to this masterpiece.

pakeezah has a very interesting history (which is well documented in the 'trivia' section) about how it came to be. it seems as if destiny conspired to test kamal amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elocution. as a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer.meena kumari lives the tragedy of nargis and sahib jaan like her own. the other stars of the film, besides her, are ghulam mohammed (the music director), lata mangeshkar, naushad (background score) and joseph wirsching (the d.o.p). their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. it reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again. kamal amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift.

besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over (bye-bye manhood), this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made. from the finely crafted sets, to those haunting looks meena kumari gives, no one can ever forget it. the music of pakeezah is amazing, all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry, and is definitely one of those "omg, 5 minutes another song" movies. you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past.a parody of all the dreams you've ever had..........

perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films - pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film (ie tackiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes/genres). pakeezah is indigenous to the sub-continent and authentic, almost madam butterfly-like in plot. characters are well-developed, direction, although sometimes unrefined by today's standards, perceptive and convincing. the urdu-speaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age! the acting (particularly the 'looks' and the dynamic between characters) are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim india.coupled, with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance (kathak). as is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he/she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience. pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.

pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of indian cinema. the film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking. the music, the songs, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives.

this movie is one among the very few indian movies, that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish, even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the p.t. styled film songs.the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety.gone are the days of great cinema, when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it, while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes. some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity, like the instance, when meena kumari refuses to say "yes" as an approval for nikah (marriage bond) and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy. at the moment, raj kumar follows her, and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumar........kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years. he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena's close ups, because meena kumari, the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971.

without question, this film has to be one of the greatest ........ in cinematic history. i have it watched too many times to remember, and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time.where does one begin?meena kumari's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career, followed closely by sahib bibi aur ghulam and phool aur pathar. each movement and nuance of her performance, makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance. her masterly interpretation of kathak coupled with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of urdhu, is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen.pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition; the photography, sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene, are so charged with symbolism and meaning, that the viewer is left breathless.naushads music, is unsurpassed, his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible, and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable.my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema, should watch this epic mediation on life and art.

at last - i've finally got round to it and managed to see a "clean" copy of pakeezah! up until now i've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the '90's, with quirky english subtitles, dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own. having thought the world of such a poor (and short) copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible.this was the lovely meena kumari's film from start to finish, and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on, finally realising it in 1971. what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards, and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah, necessitating a body double. in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it, but i'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india. it's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message, an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too. but to me it's the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar - especially thare rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding. i've seldom heard such serious, beautiful, poetic, wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack. singin' in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music - yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her. the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here, albeit a classic duet with lata. because of all this but not blind to its faults, pakeezah is my favourite indian movie, filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur. at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian "pop" music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines, the bollywood beat and bhangra.

a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and fenway park. as a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me. plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past bosox failures. and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving kevin costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience? jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love-struck couple suffering from jimmy's bosox "jones". it was a bit whacky and out of left field, but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team. the movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being overly pretentious. also enjoyable was the return of willie garson to the screen. i miss the forever-popular "stanford blatch" from sex & the city. he's always funny, even when he does or says very little. so buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time. "fever pitch" is a winner.

as a long time red sox fan, i just had to go see the movie. it was great! while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 red sox season, there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players. while the movie is certainly a chick flick, it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 red sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of ben's baseball family. the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious! a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse, date, or significant other...especially if you are a baseball fan...and even more especially if you are red sox fan!!!

i liked this movie,,cute and funny.i found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees. you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty word.sorry to say that to the yankee's fans.i recommend this picture for the entire family.of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the movie,,with i'm in love and what do i do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments.the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation( in fenway park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.

i saw "fever pitch" sort of by accident; it was playing on the airplane going over to europe. it actually wasn't half bad. ben (jimmy fallon) is the world's #1 red sox fan, but his relationship with lindsay meeks (drew barrymore) may strain that. the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples' relationships. it's especially eye-opening now that the red sox have ended their 80-odd-year losing streak. i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don't tend to notice them. not too bad.another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000's "frequency". check them both out.

if you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her' so to say then this is the film to pick. i am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy!!!). anyway i managed to get him to watch it because i told him it was about sport, and you know what, he loved it!!!drew barrymore is very funny and her leading man (sorry but can't remember his name) is equally as good. when i watched the film it was called 'the perfect match' but i think the title was changed for the uk as it is based on the book fever pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title (the same film but the uk version - phew!),anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls, take it from me, get your hubby/boyfriend in front of the television on a saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together. a real gem.

i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore's. i love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of red sox slotted in! it's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful lindsey(drew) shows them some information. this then leads in the ben(teacher) and lindsey dating. but it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive red sox fan. first of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life. it's all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field!! i got it for two quid in blockbusters so i was happy. if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of drew's work like charlie's angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics.

somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance. in reality, sports and romance go together like oil and water. so, to successfully put the two together on screen... well, that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom. i never thought it could be done. i will be the first to say that in general i don't like romantic comedies... but i do like sports and most movies about sports. this movie was a pretty good mix of the two. being a baseball fan, i could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with ben wrightman (jimmy falon) being a rabid boston redsox fan. anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the babe that plagued the redsox for 86 years, and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of redsox fans are. the farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy. this was a very good movie that could appeal to many.

ok, i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie. i can't recall ever watching one. i also don't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie. alright, i did watch taxi, but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake. but, this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing. i don't know what it is about her, but i just smile the whole time i am watch her. she just captivates me that way. i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates. how sad is that? this wasn't the greatest baseball movie - it wasn't supposed to be. it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for. it had a predictable ending, but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile.

fever pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with hollywood romantic comedies: a relationship between two people with little in common, the secret he's been hiding that she discovers, the inevitable breakup, and the very public  well, i won't go any further but you get the picture. in spite of its predictability, it works, especially if you love baseball as i do, though i'm not quite as obsessive as ben wrightman, a boston schoolteacher played by saturday night live comedian jimmy fallon.adapted from a novel by nick hornby by veteran screenplay writers lowell ganz and babaloo mandel, ben is a lifelong boston red sox fan whose uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he's been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women. ben is not just a fan but a "fanatic" who travels to fort meyers, florida each winter for the red sox spring training games and never misses a home game during the regular season. his family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a red sox museum to visit.when he falls for business consultant lindsay meeks (drew barrymore), he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but ben is not quite ready to do that. he would rather attend the yankee series than go with her to baltimore to meet her parents or to go to paris with her and miss the anaheim series. it takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving, for him to stop and think about his priorities, especially when a pint-size dr. phil wannabe asks him, "you love the red sox, but have they ever loved you back?" while the premise of fever pitch is that some things are more important than baseball (perish the thought), you would never know it from the way things turn out. of course, to any one familiar with the history of the boston red sox, it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans -- but this is 2004, the year the curse of the bambino came to an end and as the red sox move to a new level, ben might just do the same. both lead performances are excellent and the farrelly brothers even manage a pretty gross gag. while fever pitch will never be mistaken for an art film, it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures. go blue jays!.

i love and admire the farrelly brothers! how come i only got to see this great movie 3 years after it's release? it made me laugh, it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart. big time. it's hard to describe in my rotten english - but i have to try anyway:the cast is excellent throughout - from the lead- to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited.i think that the farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they're deeeeeep! they talk about what life is all about (i won't tell you!).in my case, this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about:if you love somebody: set them free, let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other.i'm not a sports-hater, but definitely a sports ignorant. but in this movie - the vibes get you. i could smell the atmosphere of baseball. finally, this movie explained to me what being a sports-fan can mean to you and what cool fan-families there must be out there.thanks so much, pete & bob!p.s.: if you haven't seen it - please check out kingpin!

it's rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie (eg. big fat greek wedding; me, myself & irene). there were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. all around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. i thought the ending was a little abrupt. it feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish. the acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. if i'd known it was a farrelly brothers movie i would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie. good for them, i hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films.

the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon, who i've had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on snl. i am a die-hard yankees fan, and i didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the alcs games. i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldn't have to hear that which must not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable.i thought jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy. i know that it may not be a academy award-winning stretch, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.jimmy and drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past. (ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie? what?) i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because taxi could have killed it. i think fever pitch will help him out a lot. everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies. i imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (tom hanks, russell crowe, etc) you'll see that they started off in some flops. busom buddies? australian soap operas? here's wishing jimmy a successful career on screen. i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do?

i was not only an extra in this movie, i got to see it in boston to a sold out cinema. over a thousand boston red sox / farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near boston common to watch a comedy....about them....red sox fanatics! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust. the love is between the two young lovers. the lust is for the red sox winning the world series. although fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. he is funny enough and gets the most laughs. barrymore on the other hand is the same old barrymore. at times, i felt supporting actress ione skye would have been a better actor for the role. all in all, all boston red sox fans will love this movie. for the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.

admittedly, i know nothing about baseball, i'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers' latest film, fever pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. the film is not really about baseball; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place.jimmy fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher. ben is a kind of man-boy, who unfortunately has never really grown up, and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team. ben has devoted his life to the sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.one day, while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office, ben meets the go-getting lindsey (a wonderful drew barrymore). lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing. he's initially hesitant to ask her out, thinking that she's way out of his "class," and, lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in ben.their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a farrelly brothers movie. rather than accept lindsey's - rather urgent - request to reschedule, ben sticks around to play nurse, orderly, and janitor. so ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards. soon they are falling in love, with lindsey blithely accepting ben's fanatical devotion to his sport.having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, ben has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game. but their relationship, which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter, hits a snag at the start of the season.lindsey wants ben to do other things, like holiday with her parents and party with her friends, but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway. can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work? can she really accommodate ben's infatuation with sports? can a die-hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all? of course, lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends. lindsey's strictest buddy, the skinny, rich and blond robin (kadee strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30. however, plump, curly-haired sarah (marissa jaret winokur) and molly (ione skye) supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben.ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman. fallon is terrific as ben, exhibiting real big screen potential, overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic. barrymore, meanwhile, is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs.fever pitch really works, and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments, the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory.much of the movie was filmed at boston's fenway park, which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the ambiance of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. even so, fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect. mike leonard september 05.

yes, commitment. let's say "fever pitch" might trick you into believing it's a baseball movie.but no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers. but of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; with all the references (pretty accurate ones, i'd say) to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history; from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it, including those two words you cannot pronounce in front of a boston fan: bill buckner.drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who, usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher? thing is, fallon's character wins barrymore's heart by being funny, caring, sweet and downright perfect. but her friends ask her a logical question: if he's such a keeper, why is he still on the market? enter the boston red sox. he's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him; he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long while.and that delicate balance, how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy's obsession; and how much is that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life, is what this movie is all about.at first, you might think that the sports-obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief. well, i'm sad to admit, they are not. myself, as a die-hard houston astros fan, can say they are all true. i would try at every way available to see every 'stros game; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet. i read the chronicle's sports section every day. and yes, my room looks like the shed, minute maid park's gift shop; with a closet full of astros gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. fallon's character even has the red sox mbna mastercard.fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful, even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon (thank god adam sandler wasn't in it); and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other's passions.i'd say it'll be a classical romantic comedy. not enough to be among the best movies in history; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike.

i got to see this on the plane to nz last week, and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book. i have to say i was favorable impressed. if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc, who have had success through the years. as a brit i was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on. one question springs to mind - was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino? or was another team in the frame? as a red sox fan myself (weird i know, a brit who understands baseball) i have to say that it added to the enjoyment.

i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie. this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in. she falls in love but when spring comes along, she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her on.it's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has. he can't part from what he loves the most, that's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life. also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is.it's a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one.

the movie shocked me. personally i had herd mostly bad buzz. well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night. though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes. the best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship. there were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship. i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate,they date,something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that mold. we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti-love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again. i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times.and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also. it's no "my fair lady" but it is a spirited and honest film. i'll simply say i like it.

i have to admit that i went into fever pitch with low expectations. it's no huge revelation for me to say that jimmy fallon's last movie (taxi) was catwomanly bad, and the trailers for fever pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me. i was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review..."i like jimmy fallon, but taxi was strike one in his movie career. well, now we've got steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! one more strike, and it's back to snl!" or "buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets to fever pitch. you'll walk out of the theater and never go back!" then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than i was expecting. but hey, i couldn't let my puns go to waste, right? another reason i thought i wouldn't care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox. my whole family hates 'em. the mere mention of pedro martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom. oh man, hold on......all right, i'm back. anyway, my mom, who is a st. louis cardinals fan, still believes the world series was rigged last year. she refuses to believe the sox won it legitimately. but i'm man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize, albeit only slightly, with the plight of red sox fans.anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level. unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as fallon's ben can go through. there's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate. well, figuratively speaking. it's the joy of being a sports fan. "wait 'til next year," becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and fever pitch effectively captures that essence.i love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the red sox' improbable world series run last year. i don't love it so much that i want to marry it, but you know what i mean. i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner, and while some of the humor is a little silly, it's actually pretty realistic.you see, ben's uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died he left ben his two season tickets. ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years. at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him. he makes everybody dance for the yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the royals (sorry mr. shade) and the devil rays. it's a very good scene, and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the "ticket draft day." i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents. the red sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it. one of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result. been there. it's a very tense and scary situation. weeeeeell, ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game. ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome. lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think. yeah, sports fans can be weird, i don't deny it. but it's real.now if you're expecting the crude, edgy stuff that the farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed. they do have their moments though, like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth "like an adorable stroke victim," but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the bros are putting on display.that's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy. thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the farrellys know when to pull away. a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying, "you've gotta tell me about the outfield. is it spongy?" jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm. fever pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre. it's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to. particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em.now if the red sox fans could please shut up about the "curse of the bambino" i would appreciate it. my memphis tigers have never won the ncaa basketball championship, so i officially declare my plight greater than yours.the gist fans of jimmy fallon, drew barrymore, romantic comedy, the red sox, baseball, or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look. i wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time, but it'll make a great matinée.rating: 3.25 (out of 5)

this is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike.drew barrymore is at her best in this movie. as a drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops. i had my doubts about jimmy fallon but he totally delivered as ben the comical, sports crazed sweetheart. the comedy in this movie is great, there were several laugh out loud moments.their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day. instead of leaving he helps take care of her, helping her change into pajama's then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was 'very lady-like...no chunks.' everything goes great between ben and lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts. lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed ben is with the red sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single. she tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wont feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games. she even buys all the books on the red sox she can find including one on 'the curse of bambino'.everything is going pretty well until lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period. it both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with. a very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized red sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant.eventually ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday party after she said "i had to check my calender and when i saw the there was a red sox/yankee game i knew i would be going stag'. after the party ben tells her it was 'the best night of his life'. shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him "it was the best game ever!!!" ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting lindsay when she says "a few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life" he says "well that was a few minutes ago."so they separate for a while, he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he didn't it would 'remind him too much of what he gave up for them'. lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her. it ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love, lindsay. they still go to the games and even attend the final world series game and st. louis and it is a happy ending all around. 2 thumbs up!!

fever pitch is a fun enough movie. it has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). like most romantic comedies, it has a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy, "she's breaking up with me" stuff happens, but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox, it's not overloaded with sports. you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film.of course that's easy for me to say: i've been a red sox fan since i was a boy, too.7 out of 10.barky

the farrelly brothers, bobby and peter, are at it again. with "fever pitch" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes, abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen, something that it would have been hard to do. the novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with soccer, since it is set in england, where that sport consumes most of british sports fans. it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell, to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans, when they make their hero, a boston red sox fan."fever pitch" is a film that presents an obsessive fan, ben wrightly, whose life revolves into the red sox season, and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them. when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm, he meets, and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks, a young woman who is going places, but at thirty, has no life of her own.the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox, at home games, in fenway park. this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world, having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but, until 2004, never won a world series. in fact, the ending, from what we heard, had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film. ms. barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. jimmy fallon, a popular television comedian, turned movie actor, has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in "taxi", in our humble opinion.the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale.

"fever pitch" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).i have lived through a milder version of such a story, as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the mets first world series win and then i watched the mets clinch their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons, who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again (and it was me who took our older son to his only fenway park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in boston).so compared to reality, the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. it is particularly impressive that drew barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-barbie skills, though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work.it is even set up credibly how she meets jimmy fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his "winter guy" -- though it's surprising that his red sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his jekyll-and-hyde "summer guy." their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way, from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity.while the ending borrows heavily from o. henry, the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the red sox organization for filming at the stadium).the script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesn't have a boston accent, as an immigrant from new jersey, but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his "summer family" of other season ticket holders, who kindly kibitz the basics of sox lore to neophyte barrymore (and any such audience members).the song selection includes many red sox fans' favorites, from the opening notes of the classic "dirty water," though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear.

i saw this movie on thursdays night after having a really boring day. i had no expectations, those i had were rather negative. being that the only movie i've ever watched jimmy in is the american version of taxi with queen latifah(?)...don't ask why! but seriously..this movie is so cute! drew barrymore is always sweet, but i almost fell in love with fallon's character. why can't i meet a cute nerd like that. :) movies like that are excellent. simple, sweet and necessary. sunday on a thursdays. i'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about american movies with baseball that fascinates me. probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in norway.(my first comment ever.) haha

if you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the american league pennant race satisfying. on the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for kill bill volume 3 or sin city 2 then you probably should stay away. the plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. there is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. that's all par for the course in a movie like this. however, what i liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky. the plot centers around answering the questions; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks? it is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. barrymore does a very good job in her role and fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well. i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. add another point if you are a red sox fan and subtract two points if you are a yankees fan.

my daughter gets really put out at me when i refer to drew barrymore as looking as if she'd been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her dudley dooright chin that jay leno would die for. how wonderful, then, when i discovered in "fever pitch" that i really like miss barrymore; and jimmy fallon; and the red sox; and boston! this film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. to be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and jimmy fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.my sports-hating wife, my teenage daughter, and i all found something to like in the film. that says something in itself. it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so, and is probably a really good date flic, too.

i went to see fever pitch with my mom, and i can say that we both loved it. it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other, and blah blah blah... you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together. it was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie be about them getting together. people could actually relate to the film, because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances, or impossible situations. it was really funny, and i think it was jimmy fallon's best performance. all in all... i would definitely recommend it!

what i expected: a rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.what i got: an even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works! barrymore is classic barrymore: that perfect blend of sweet, strong, and adorable. we expect that from her and she delivered.but fallon is the nice surprise in this film. he brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life, like caring about kids and his girlfriend. fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection. he can be caring ("you just ran across the field for me!") and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the red sox ("how did the grass feel? kinda spongy?") at the same time. fallon's portrayal "made" the movie. hopefully, this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for fallon, something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of snl alums (i.e. will ferrell).in short, a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines, most delivered with brilliant subtlety by fallon.hey, i saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as i did. it's neither a "guy flick" nor a "chick flick". it's a terrific make-you-laugh flick. go see it!

documenting a documenter. that's one way to describe keep the river on your right: a modern cannibal tale. this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to west papua and then peru. tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru, tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. this film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (watch for the graphic circumcision scene). when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "why not?" who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. this film shows what can be done shot on video. the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination. at times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. that said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle. move over river queen, this is the best river ride i've taken in a while.

i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum, all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers. the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving. i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.

i read schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. his subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. even so, schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.

domini enfilren (marlene dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. now that he has died she is free--but doesn't know what she wants. boris androvsky (charles boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. they meet accidentally in algiers, fall in love and get married. but he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him...way overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. dietrich and boyer do their best to give good performances but nobody could get away with some of their lines! still, in a way, it is a classic. it's shot in gorgeous technicolor (try to see it on dvd) where every frame is breath-takingly beautiful. dietrich is always dressed to the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body. boyer just walks around looking stricken (no shock there). still i was never bored. it was wonderful to look at and the non-stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches. the end almost had me falling out of my chair because i was laughing so hard! now i love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really---this is unbelievable! it also runs a very short 80 minutes.as a camp classic i give this an 8. as a serious movie--a 1.

the pioneering technicolor cinematography (winner of special technical achievement oscar) is indeed enchanting. add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer, and you've got a rather pleasant "picture".unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired. still, there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few since then, that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in "robin hood" (1938), "jesse james" (1939) and "gone with the wind" (1939), will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. "the garden of allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.

"the garden of allah" is a prime example of "popular women's literature", turn of the xxth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of catholic guilt. just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins, or the heroine of "rebecca" couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife (and her castle burned down around her), or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs, domini, the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe, can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows. like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours, this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book: basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late. the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act. it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards. oh well... it could have been much worse and it often was...without the religious overtones, the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick: oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic, shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery, all passion spent, leaving her to clean up his mess. and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's "thais", a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression, some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name, thankfully.but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism, of course, is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering, vibrant life. imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all, a truckload of worthy character actors (including one cute dog), a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the "composed film" that michael powell (who, ironically, had a bit part in the 1927 silent version) always dreamed about, tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic, operatic exoticism, a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object, characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next, dialog is sparse, vague and suggestive, the art direction is close to celestial, flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent, the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats, saints, doomed but horny sinners, mystics or poets.ahh... hollywood! the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable. the bit rate is very high throughout, the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession.a historical note on this sort of "women's subject": the following year (1937), julien duvivier, visibly inspired by "the garden of allah", directed "carnet de bal", where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine (widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book. she finds them all in time, only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood, overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences. it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later.

gorgeous techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a trappist monk who has left his monastery, breaking his vows. the film opens at a convent in europe, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named domini (marlene dietrich). she is advised by the mother superior to go to the desert and "find herself", and lose her grief over her father who has recently died. in the train car on the way into the sahara she sits opposite a very, very troubled man (charles boyer) - our former monk. she's soon at a hotel near a palm-treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. domini becomes friends with him, though knows nothing of his past - romance soon to follow.this film is sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a bit campy) - i found it to be quite fun and entertaining. the photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial close-ups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures against a sunset sky. marlene dietrich gives a nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous. charles boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this, i think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too. basil rathbone is fine here, except given very little to do. another great orchestral score by max steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable film.

audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length technicolor film. i can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip). at any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd. in fact, just how good it looks is amazing.kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski, director of photography virgil miller, selznick international pictures and, for the dvd - mgm home entertainment. all of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.i thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. it gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. i can't say more without spoiling things.marlene dietrich never looked better, i don't believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character ("domini enfilden"). heart-throb charles boyer was the male star and domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. people like joseph schildkraut as "batouch;" john carradine as "the sand diviner;" the most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer "irena," played by tilly losch. wow, there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed. just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd. looking at her imdb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.basil rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing "sherlock holmes," also is in here as is c. aubrey smith, another famous british actor of his day. schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, "the shop around the corner," with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan.the beautiful direction, photography and color, and tilly's dance, are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one. had the last half hour been better - although i admire the ending - i would have rated it even higher. it's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.

"the garden of allah" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip technicolor films. to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature (after disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's "becky sharp" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes."the garden of allah" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. that being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat.

in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! i had no idea that technicolor came out so early. although i didn't like the ending, the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa. the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick. basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie. i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets... the hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there... the legionnaires also bring a "beau geste" feeling to the film. they certainly don't make movies like these anymore. don't fail to watch this classic!

marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous. she look great; boyer looks young and trim.story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by max steiner, and a good supporting cast. the film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide, c. aubrey smith is the old priest, lucile watson the mother superior, tilly losch the dancer, john carradine the diviner, and basil rathbone plays.... well i'm not sure. he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! as others have noted, john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich. i can't help but think he would have been wonderful. the role of world-weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well. and after the success of queen christina (with garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.i can't think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color. she looks great and wears some terrific clothes. my favorite is the valentino as the shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars.

i give this movie an a+ for the sheer camp of it! as dietrich's daughter maria riva wrote in the book on her mother, "if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp, it can be very amusing." and how! i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. viewers who've read the accounts of boyer's toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!). dietrich's costumes are out of this world. as riva notes in her book, dietrich managed to steal paramount's travis banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns, such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.i heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor. it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.in short, if you watch the garden of allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness, you can't help but enjoy it.

north africa in the 1930's. to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith. they will meet and passions will be stirred, but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in the garden of allah.the plot is pure hokum, but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at. marlene dietrich & charles boyer are a superb screen couple. she is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and boyer gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him. the supporting cast is excellent: basil rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert; joseph schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all the "arabic" he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish); lucile watson as a gentle mother superior; alan marshal as an honorable young french officer; tilly losch as a dangerous dancer; henry brandon as a comic porter; john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner; and magnificent sir c. aubrey smith as a wise old priest.movie mavens will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun; marcia mae jones & bonita granville (peeking over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector; and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all uncredited.color films of the 1930's are both rare & lovely to look at, and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. the garden of allah was the first technicolor film to be shot on location. yuma, arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt. when the daily rushes showed boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red, producer david o. selznick finally gave in. the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage.

if the australian post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it.this is one of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again. miranda's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia unimagined by many europeans, in that it can be cold, wet and bleak, just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you. the characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a 'dead letter office' a thought to be considered. miranda has gone on to do bigger movies, but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one?.

this film is a wonderfully simplistic work. enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time. the performances from miranda otto (oh, how she deserves so much more recognition!)and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch, as the two tortured souls come to understand each other. the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit-parts in them selves, as is alice's long-suffering boyfriend, who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for. there's one particular scene i could watch over and over (and i have!), it's such a shame that films like these don't get recognition, and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy. i cried, i laughed and i sighed. i'd recommend this film to anyone.

letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. here, alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father. what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss, frank. a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema. now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop, overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film. it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads. this film succeeds where garry marshall's other dead letter office flic dear god (1996 - usa) failed, and comes close to the brilliance of, not the kevin costner turkey, but he jianjun's postman (1995 - china).

this film is underrated. i loved it. it was truly sweet and heartfelt. a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today. the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood have.instead the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up. he does, slowly, by the film's end. he has a ways to go, but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward. his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time. a truly heartfelt indie

for what it is, "raising victor vargas" is about as close to perfection as a film can get. either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each), this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. the film begins with a strong flavor of "street" but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. in my experience, never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). praised by the critics but not for everyone, "raising victor vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness. (a)

this film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years. it is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary-not contrived but very real. it is very interesting and unsettling

i'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.but they just don't understand the movie.the story is about growing up in a difficult situation.there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren.and there's good reason why so many critics like this movie.and the reason is because they understand the movie.i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people.i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines.i frankly don't have anything else to say.

one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film( can i actually call it that?- it would invoke the devil out of its fans)on a micro budget but packed with such taste, sensitiveness and maturity. peter sollett- you deserve more admiration and respect.thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the "industry" that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet. one location,a handful of rich characters, low budget,good acting(and that too amateurs),decent lighting - worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching...well...you know what.

there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie's details far more eloquently than i could; but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment. raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it. this flick gets inside your head.

raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see. it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in. it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through. victor, a cocky teen, but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family. at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too.i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family. thats how much feeling this movie has. one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple. victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that. it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real. overall i give this movie a b+

this movie works because it feels so genuine. the story is simple and realistic, perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most/all of us experienced during our teen years.the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers. the dialogue is fresh and honest... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references. also, the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful, bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible way.on an artistic level, i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo-realism films like the bicycle thief and la strada. movies rarely feel as "real" as this does ... or as bicycle thief did. and the only other movie i've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazan's splendor in the grass. writer/director peter sollett deserves tremendous praise. this film is quite an achievement.on a personal level, i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect. as an italian-american, i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema (as racist, womanizing, criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics), and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations. hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies. (good thing gong li didn't try to become famous in america!)of course, thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures, and the influence of miramax, we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best. while i do really like my big fat greek wedding, it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight (with less exaggerated and broadly-drawn characters) while still being very funny in its own right. finally! latino characters worthy of note. i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered.of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic, i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon! :) - marc dipaolo

one of the best films i have seen in the past five years! the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making. funny, charming, sad and inspiring, this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry clark's often-nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs... although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare. raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing... so don't miss it!

wow! i loved this movie and love judy marte!! this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face, she's funny and really really talented!! she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her! we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years... and probably also from director peter sollett and co-star victor rasuk!raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time! very refreshing! it's true, nice, funny, well filmed, it got it all : good story, good actors, good film direction!if you like simple, slow paced, real life, urban movies, like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith, you'll love victor vargas! it's better!

if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy/girlfriend, or first puppy love fling...this film is for you! ok so this movie would and will never win an oscar but as a dominican i loved it...there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture...the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father, the youngest son being babied and bathed with a cafe bustelo tin (sooo dominican!), judy being harassed by the neighborhood men, going to church and lighting a prayer candle...the film's brilliance was in those small details. granted, it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture ( tip: make new friends instead). more of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumentery, this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously. as in the tradition of "y tu mama tambien" this was simply one boy's coming of age tale. i recommend it (especialmente si eres dominicano!) =o)

this movie feels like a film project. as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective. it's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. this provides for some predictable but well done conflict. probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. a good watch but nothing stirring....

i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that, as happens often on amazon.com, there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same, somewhat obscure talking points, almost verbatim. a campaign? only imdb knows.as for this movie: it's fine. it's a funny, cute and very straightforward movie.it's been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn, lived in queens and visited relatives in the south bronx. but i found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids. is the grandmother a bizarre character? yup. do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this? yes, thankfully, they do. are other movies set in the les and featuring dominican / puerto rican kids possible? you betcha. does that make this movie a crime  as some of the (to my eyes, astroturf) comments would suggest? hardly. let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.this is better than any episode of degrassi jr. high or degrassi high. scoff at the comparison but _we've never had that_ and i'm touched, to the core, by this movie's humility of purpose and tender spirit.that said, i'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! :-d

peter sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the lower east side of new york, or loisaida, as it's known by the locals.mr. sollett's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family, that is typical of the different 'inner cities' of the country. mr. sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents. these are basically good kids, the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing. instead of presenting his characters as losers, mr. sollett shows a positive side they all have. these kids are not into drugs, or are stealing because they are poor. had this story been done by hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of children that are struggling, but deep down inside, they are not defeated.victor rasuk, as victor vargas, was a revelation. he is a natural. so is july marte. her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she doesn't want to do. altagracia guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. she conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her. all in all, this was an excellent picture thanks to peter sollett.

"victor doesn't have much, but that's not stopping him from trying to go out with judy, the prettiest girl on the block. all he's got is hope and a one-bedroom apartment he shares with his family. his grandmother doesn't trust him, his brother worships him, and his half-sister just declared war. but victor thinks love really can conquer all in this warm, genuine, and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city most people never see," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.peter sollett' "raising victor vargas" elicits engaging "debut" performances from lead actor victor rasuk (as victor vargas) and the cast. mr. rasuk and juicy judy marte (as judy gonzalez) are sexy and endearing as "lower east side kids" discovering the joy of sexual attraction. considering how attractive they look in this picture, it's not hard to predict they hook up - and, although you may wonder how "innocent" they really are, their characterizations seem true.victor's brother "nino" is played by victor's real-life brother silvestre rasuk, who looks the part his older brother is playing. sometimes, it's nice to see movie brothers who actually look alike; and, hopefully they will work together again. "cuckoo for cocoa puffs" sister krystal rodriguez (as vicki) and old world altagracia guzman (as grandma) round out the sex-starved dominican immigrant family. so, are hand-held-camera coming-of-age films in vogue, or what? ******* raising victor vargas (5/16/02) peter sollett ~ victor rasuk, july marte, silvestre rasuk

incredibly intriguing and captivating, i found it impossible to turn away once i began to watch. i am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant, strange as this may sound i could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations. from a cinematographic i thought there was great use of light and texture. from the orange glow of the summer light, down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me.from a character perspective i thought the notion of victor vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired, each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself.beyond that, having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation, i can say the situation felt particularly realistic. the awkwardness, the accent, the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me.i think this film worked for me because i began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion, well worth a watch.

i saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'cafe bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic. this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. i completely see what the writer/director was going for, and he hit the target perfectly! this film is highly deserving of a better rating.

true fans of film will love this authentic movie.i disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one-star and calling it unrealistic. while i don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists, i've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave. i don't know what the basis is for others' comments that the film is "unrealistic". the dialog is great.the low budget production value didn't bother me a bit. i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film. the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy hollywood propping or melodrama.i completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions. the acting was believable and impressive for new and non-actors.if your idea of good film is transformers or fast & furious, then skip it. if you enjoy good character driven dramas, then see it.(regarding the negative commenters being "trolls": click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews.)

this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good, if eccentric, use of the isle of man as a background. the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class english girls, and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes. the story is altered a little from the traditional version: early on it is oddly combined with the plot of "king lear", and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual. it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well, but does go over the top at times.

creative use of modern and mystical elements: 1956 cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother kathleen turner (john waters' "serial mom") and the 2 twisted sisters; queen mab as the faerie godmother; david warner (evil in "time bandits") in redcoat at court; cinderella (she's a babe) shovelling coal into an insatiable furnace; cinderella and her prince charming both look like (and act like) rock stars. isle of man locations.

i thought it was an original story, very nicely told. i think all you people are expecting too much. i mean...it's just a made for television movie! what are you expecting? some great wonderful dramtic piece? i thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie....and that's my opinion.

i've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. this one ought to be a cult fave! the best line, "your dress is deeply cool!" says the prince to cinderella. kathleen turner shines as the stepmother. i also like the 1950's era cars and motorcycles. the melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. he tries to stay cool, but fails to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess-to-be. her slipper is not glass (truer to the original story), but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne. my only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get. hopefully blockbuster or amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon.

i remember watching the disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. plenty of other renditions, ever after put aside, of cinderella, have, in fact, lost their touch throughout the years. then i found this production with a flawless performance by kathleen turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.we all know the story of cinderella, a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella (whose real name is zizola, and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. thus, zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. there, the bored prince valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named mab) with rose petals for slippers. what drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to. it does not weave a web of lies like most cinderella stories, it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did. instead it shows more of cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! the costumes are all beautifully made, especially zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the marcella plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft, spirit-like voice. i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting twist. my only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other fairy tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.

this film was almost a great imaginative film. a mixture of shakespeare, pop, jazz, and faerie tales. this movie was an imaginative twist on the cinderella theme. featuring a strong cast, headed by the perfectly cast kathleen turner, this movie had everything going for it. everything but production values. i almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an over the top production like this, it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie. besides better cinematography, this film was almost perfect.

this was a great movie but it had the worst ending i think i have ever seen!!! the actors were great and displayed wonderful talent. the entire story was twisted and unexpecting, which, is what made it entertaining. as good as the movie was, the entire film is judged by the ending, which was terrible! maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending.

my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on. i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were, it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister. thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had,i truly appreciate themhi everyone!this is heather's mom. it's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made. harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel. our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.

excellent story about teenagers, leaders, high school football "stars". how far will you go to protect your friends? lie, kill? how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl? can love beat the odds? can you defeat narrow-minded small town people? when your friend scores and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it, or will you be a man about it, and respect her right to chose? will you rape her and show it as your victory over a "problem" girl? can you stand by the one who's only sin is to have an opinion of her own, to be able to make her own decisions, to chose for herself? it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong, but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general. thumb up!

i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago. i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me. she fought alone is about a girl, caitlin (played by tiffani thiessen), who is raped by jace (played by david lipper), a classmate who enjoys hurting girls. caitlin is in a popular high school clique, but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her, led by ethan (played by brian austin green).this movie chronicles caitlin's struggle against an entire town, including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment, allowing them to get away with whatever they wish.thiessen and green are the top performers, and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film. all of the actors in this film, which was inspired by actual events, did a great job. she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school (at least in 1995), and having one's self-esteem and reputation at stake. recommended. 10/10

i really like this film... when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon, but it surprised me... i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now. the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again (the first time being beverly hills 90210). i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but i do agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is sort of disappointing. i would have loved it to turn out a little different! never mind though, good gripping story.

when i saw this movie, i was amazed that it was only a tv movie. i think this movie should have been in theaters. i have seen many movies that are about rape, but this one stands out. this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today, let alone tv movies. it tells a story that i'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today, and i found it to be very believable(which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies). i also thought that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played. i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them. i enjoyed it very much.

i enjoyed this movie,and after watching it,it made me wonder just how many 'caitlin rose's' exist in the world.how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse,and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it? just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another,because as this film demonstrates,who's right is not foremost important,its who is popular,and feared which manipulates the minds of youths,and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim,and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved,and his best friend.this is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves.remarkable,and brilliant,too good to be just a film made for tv.

back in 2004 i saw "true", tom tykwer's contribution to paris je t'aime. when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled. it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much. of course i wanted to watch the whole film, and i would even check who was attached, etc.yesterday i finally saw it, courtesy of the internet.first of all i must say that it looks awesome. the photography is beautiful in every short and shot, at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. later i read the trivia here, and maybe it's how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dp's work. my special favorites are the "quais de seine" first scene (that sunlight!), the sin city-esquire (but better for me) "quartier de la madeleine", and "14th arrondisement" - but you know, what the hell i like them all: "true" or "faubourg saint-denis" still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours (my eyes, they tremble!) and "quartier latin" is gold imprisoned on silver. beautiful.yes, these are some beautiful short films.now let's get onto the content. i very much (and i mean very much) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt. you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts, and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts. i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy-chinese-musical-in-paris-with-barbet-schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue. i love surprises! and this film has them! it's great they took a chance to let all these director's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema (which i have come to heavily despise). it's not heavily experimental, but i can breath the breathing space these people had.i like the small time and i love the acting. i love the simplicity and i love the love. i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it's a film that is very very very nice to see, alone or with someone. to simply feel. it left me feeling very good.there is something about the earnestness in it... it's so frank...what i didn't like? well, for me there are two shorts that aren't exactly the best - "quais de seine" (which is good natured, sure, and maybe even necessary, but feels too much like a commercial?) and "père-lachaise" that even though i love the acting, i felt it's themes were forced. but that of course, is just me. "tour eiffel" i also didn't love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet? i don't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor's and directors, and so they can delight in their interaction, in the surprises (look out for alexander payne in a funny role) and basically in "what will this director do with this?" great question. i enjoyed it very much in that way.i repeat now: most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix. i definitely recommend it. definitely!!! so, watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love!

with the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet sunday that is just about to fully wake up, love can be felt in the soft breeze that sweeps past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people i walk alongside. it is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a café-o-lait before heading off to the city of lights and love. of course, a flight to paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic's budget so i had to opt for the next best thing, paris, je t'aime, a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors. each piece is named after a different parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love. careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions, paris, je t'aime explores love at the many stages of its own game. the results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent. and truly, what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments. the beautifully poetic quote above is taken from tom tykwer's faubourg saint denis. true to form, tykwer (run, lola, run) uses time-lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love, from inception to dissolution. originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology, faubourg stars natalie portman as francine, an american actress in paris for a part in a film, and melchior beslon as thomas, a blind man she falls in love with. here, the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain, where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences. as love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying, tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt.perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from sylvain chomet's tour eiffel. choosing the city's most identifiable attraction for its title, chomet (les triplettes de belleville) gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love. his father, a mime (paul putner), finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail. this is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life (yolande moreau). miming has become something of a dying art, if it isn't already dead. yet by nature, it is dreamy and untroubled. miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd? we might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously.paris, je t'aime keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers. three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child. walter salles (motorcycle diaries) has catalina sandino moreno singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living. nobuhiro suwa (un couple parfait) has juliette binoche trying desperately to overcome the emptiness she feels after losing her son. binoche says very little yet, not surprisingly given her immense talent, her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go. and alfonso cuaron (children of men) weighs in with one continuous shot of a father (nick nolte) and his grown daughter (sara martins) walking together for what must be the first time in a long while. we see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters narrows to a place of comfort and accepting.the last short to screen is alexander payne's 14ieme arrondissement. as usual, payne (sideways) takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary. carol (margo martindale) is another american in paris. she is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home. she is a plain person with an uneventful life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush. in beautifully delivered americanized french, she muses about the sights and how being there makes her feel. this woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers, she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew. she falls in love, if only for perhaps a moment, with life and love itself.the characters that appear but fleetingly in paris, je t'aime find themselves at the romantic center of the universe. the moments they share with each other, be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge, are the moments that give love its flare and flourish. outside the city of lovers, it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance. it takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky. you just have to keep your heart open to see it. and if one city can be so abundant with love, one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door.

paris, je t'aime is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love, a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing. ask a large group of people their impressions of life in paris and the result would be something akin to this film. tied together by each of the sectors or arrondissement of the city, the film examines love in all forms, native folk in their parisian modes, and tourists interacting with the great city. approximately twenty writers and directors, each with about five minutes of screen time, include olivier assayas, the coen brothers, sylvain chomet, isabel coixet, wes craven, alfonso cuarón, gérard depardieu, christopher doyle, vincenzo natali, alexander payne, walter salles, nobuhiro suwa, and gus van sant among others less well known. the stories vary from hilarious, to humorous, to touching, to tragic, to banal, to tender.in one story a young frenchman (gaspard ulliel) is attracted to a young lithographer (elias mcconnell), pouring out his heart in french to a lad who speaks only english. in another a separated husband and wife (gena rowlands and ben gazzara) meet in the latin quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in père-lachaise (emily mortimer and rufus sewell) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed oscar wilde intervenes. steve buscemi in tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections, in bastille sergio castellitto (in love with mistress leonor watling) is ready to divorce his wife miranda richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia, juliette binouche confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in place des victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy willem defoe, sara martins and nick nolte and ludivine sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in parc monceau, fanny ardant and bob hoskins 'play out' a strange relationship in pigalle, melchior beslon plays a young blind man to actress natalie portman in learning how to see in faubourg saint-denis, vampire love between elijah wood and olga kurylenko in quartier de la madeleine, maggie gyllenhaal is an ex-patriot actress stung out on drugs in quartier des enfants rouges, and margo martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the french she has studied for her life's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème arrondissement.the final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible, but this only works on superficial levels. the film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories, a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action. but it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re-visit like a scrapbook of a time in paris. it is a film worth seeing multiple times! grady harp

i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies, especially as i'm such a cynic myself. it's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the "been there, done that" approach to every movie she sees. i'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. far, far better than going to see some brain dead "chick flick", which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy, according to the demographics? eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris, a city i haven't visited in 20 years. but i wish i had. they are loosely linked by joining shots, and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. some of the films work better than others but, as other reviewers have said, it never descends too far into kitsch. some are funny, some are sad, some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (i'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the "flying tiger, hidden dragon" hairdressing salon.) some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes paris look too good. it can also be cold, wet, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or, in summer, baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. but i'm nit picking. my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station, and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without buscemi having to say a word. i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists, which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch, but it just stayed on the right side. rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent, and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very, very uncomfortable. i thought both the bob hoskins / fanny ardent piece, and ben gazzara / gena rowlands fell a bit flat, but maggie gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? i watched sherry baby last week.) but i felt the two "social justice" pieces (for want of a better way of putting it), worked very well. by that, i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. and then the film about the african migrant, struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society, who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young, new paramedic. yet another murder statistic, in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life, every year. i thought both pieces very well observed.the final film, 14th arrondissement, in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris  in very badly accented french  to her night school french class, moved me. a perfect ending, to a good, intriguing if not quite great, movie. paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works pretty well.

thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently (thought i'd missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest). paris, je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 mins each) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris.one of my fave segments is 'parc monceau' by alfonso cuarn (great expectations, harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban), which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte.the coen brothers' 'tuileries' starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! juliette binoche and willem dafoe in 'place des victoires' was haunting.for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress/druggie in 'quartier des enfants rouges' to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant.elijah wood as a vampire victim in 'quartier de la madeleine' was pretty surreal, while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven's 'pre-lachaise'.natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in 'faubourg saint-denis'. but despite the many portrayals of young love, a more mature execution by gena rowlands in 'quartier latin' was equally aww-inducing.this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of.there are also a number of memorable quotes. one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days: "in pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love."

it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure!annoying, that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum, i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...well, i think that's it!

i just viewed the film two days ago, and i was filled with anticipation, being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 months there in the '80's. i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, while original and artistically done, did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city very well.nor enough of the romance! we saw none of the tree-lined boulevards... there was too much darkness, not only literally but figuratively. some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed, and let him/her down "flat "(the marais sequence, the coiffure salesman sequence, to give two examples). the uplifting, good ones: the mime sequence, the cemetery, the montmartre (though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend), the "cowboy" vignette ,and the sacre coeur-- seemed few and far between, and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more.

paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. you can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. the movie is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in that short amount of time. the premise works. almost all of the segments are powerful, complete, and satisfying. each presents a different aspect of the parisian experience, and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near-great actors.there were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to pick one or two favorites. probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment "place des victoires," gena rowlands as an aging beauty in "quartier latin," catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment "loin du 16ème" and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris ("14ème arrondissement" segment). special mention must be given to gulliver hecq, probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station (segment "tuileries").this is an outstanding movie. my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed. however, paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen. in any case, don't miss it!

paris je t ' aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. this movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as gus van sant, joel and ethan coen , walter salles a...(read more)nd alfonso cuaron to tell short stories about love located in paris, each one with their particular way of directing. in this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like willem dafoe, steve buscemi, natalie portman, elijah wood, gerard depardieu and many more each one with great performances. in conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness, separation, unexpected encounters and love.

oftentimes, films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime. whether it be the big name support or the project itself, paris je t'aime never falls into this realm. i believe i can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts. between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence, merging characters together in one last view of love in paris, i think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed. true, there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest, but in the end i have a lasting image, even if just a split second of each short vignette. love takes many forms, and the talent here rises to the occasion, to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotion's many facets.quartier des enfants rouges: maggie gyllenhaal surprises as a drug-addled actress shooting in paris and meeting with her dealer. the reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes hands.quatier latin: ben gazzara and gena rowlands (recreating a relationship from an old cassavettes film?) bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce. what of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other, it is all enjoyable, leaving a smile on your face.quais de seine: director gurinder chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences. it is a sweet little story of shy love between two people obviously feeling a connection, but unable to quite vocalize it.tour eiffel: i will admit to being disappointed that sylvain chomet did not get an animated sequence together, however, this live action tale of mimes falling in love at a paris jail has the same quirky nature as his film les triplettes de belleville.tuileries: the coen brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs. steve buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word. his facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled frenchman are priceless.bastille: here is a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about out of love only to have it come back in the face of tragedy. sergio castellitto and miranda richardson a moving as the couple dealing with trouble and finding how strong the bond of true love is.pére-lachaise: a surprisingly funny little tale from horror master wes craven. a little oscar wilde humor can add levity to any relationship.parc monceau: alfonso cuarón looks to be practicing the amazing long-takes he perfects in children of men with this tale of two people in love, walking down the street. as nick nolte and ludivine sagnier eventually come into close-up view, we also find the true context of their conversation of "forbidden love."porte de choisy: a very surreal look into the glamour of paris. this is probably the most odd entry, but so intriguing that you can't look away from the craziness that ensues. do not anger your asian beautician, whatever you do.pigalle: an interesting look at a relationship undergoing a role-play that seems to have been stagnant for years. a little variety from bob hoskins is necessary to fire kindled.quartier de la madeleine: even vampires in paris can find love amongst the feeding hours. i don't know whether to be happy for elijah wood as a result or not. beautifully shot and muted to allow the vibrancy of the blood red, this short is strange, but then so is love.14th arrondissement: leave it to alexander payne's odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voice-over story told of an american in paris to find what love is. her harsh, uneducated french is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents we've been listening to until this pointjust off-kilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the story.montmartre: an interesting introduction into the proceedings. paris can be a city reviled for everyday activities like finding a parking spot, yet when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey.loin du 16éme: catalina sandino moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance as the tale is bookended by her singing to a young child, yet totally different each time.place des fetes: my favorite tale of the bunch. seydou boro and aïssa maïga are simply fantastic. the cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for boro to finally ask her for coffee is tough to watch. sometimes love at your final moment is enough to accept one's leaving of this earth.place des victoires: one of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son. juliette binoche is devastating as the mother, desperate for one last glimpse of her son, and willem dafoe is oddly perfect as the cowboy who allows her the chance.faubourg saint-denis: sometimes one needs to think he has lost love to accept that he has not been fully invested in the relationship. melchior beslon reminisces, trying to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp, quick cuts from his meeting natalie portman to eventually "seeing" how much he needs her.le marais: leave it to gus van sant to show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation. his photographer from elephant is an american working in paris who is the catalyst for gaspard ulliel's artist ramblings of love and soul mates. sometimes one doesn't need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the pauses.

18 directors had the same task: tell stories of love set in paris. naturally, some of them turned out better than others, but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides, wouldn't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love? here's how i rank the segments (that might change on a second viewing):1. "quartier latin", by gérard depardieuone of the greatest french actors ever directed my favourite segment, featuring the always stunning gena rowlands and ben gazzara. witty and delightful.2. "tour eiffel", by sylvain chometcute, visually stunning (thanks to the director of "the triplets of belleville") story of a little boy whose parents are mimes;3. "tuileries", by ethan and joel coenthe coen brothers + steve buscemi = hilarious4. "parc monceau", by alfonso cuarón ("y tu mamá también", "children of men"), feat. nick nolte and ludivine sagnier (funny);5. "place des fêtes", by oliver schmitz, feat. seydou boro and aissa maiga (touching);6. "14th arrondissement", alexander payne's ("election", "about schmidt") wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here, feat. the underrated character actress margo martindale (hilary swank's mother in "million dollar baby") as a lonely, middle-aged american woman on vacation;7. "faubourg saint-denis", tom tykwer's ("run lola run") frantic style works in the story of a young actress (natalie portman) and a blind guy (melchior beslon) who fall in love;8. "père-lachaise", by wes craven, feat. emily mortimer and rufus sewell (plus a curious cameo by alexander payne as...oscar wilde!);9. "loin du 16ème", by walter salles and daniela thomas (simple but moving story from the talented brazilian directors, feat. catalina sandino moreno);10. "quartier des enfants rouges", by olivier assayas ("clean"), a sad story feat. the always fantastic maggie gyllenhaal;11. "le marais", by gus van sant, feat. gaspard ulliel, elias mcconnell and marianne faithful (simple, but funny);12. "quartier de la madeleine", by vincenzo natali, feat. elijah wood and olga kurylenko;13. "quais de seine", by gurinder chadha;14. "place des victoires", by nobuhiro suwa, feat. juliette binoche and willem dafoe;15. "bastille", by isabel coixet (fabulous director of the underrated "my life without me"), feat. miranda richardson, sergio castellitto, javier cámara and leonor watling;16. "pigalle", by richard lagravenese, feat. bob hoskins and fanny ardant;17. "montmartre", by and with bruno podalydès;18. "porte de choisy", by christopher doyle, with barbet schroeder (mostly known as the director of "barfly", "reversal of fortune" and "single white female").i could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring), but not a single of them is plain bad. on the whole, i give "paris, je t'aime" an 8.5/10 and recommend it for what it is: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between.

... for paris is a moveable feast." ernest hemingwayit is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings, novels, songs, poems, short but unforgettable quotes, and yes - movies. the celebrated film director max ophüls said about paris, "it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and paris." paris is always associated with love and romance, and "paris, je t'aime" which is subtitled "petite romances," is a collection of short films, often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world. in each, we become familiar with one of the city of light 20 arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages, genders, colors, and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages. in some of the "petite romances" we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest, closeness, and perhaps relationship: like for podalydès and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leïla bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose cross-cultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine. i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant. in "le marais" one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness, asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand french.some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark. in walter salles and daniela thomas' loin du 16ème, catalina sandino mareno (amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace) is single, working-class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work. one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is "place des fêtes" by oliver schmitz. aïssa maïga and seydou boro co-star as two young people for who love could have happened. there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere, and the city of love and light is no exception. another one that really got to me was "bastille", written and directed by isabel coixet, starring sergio castellitto, miranda richardson, and leonor watling. castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife, richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress, the devastating news from his wife's doctor arrives...i can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems. i like some of them very much. the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall, i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again. they are "place des fêtes" that i've mentioned already, "père-lachaise" directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever, oscar wilde (alexander payne, the director of "sideways") who would save one troubled relationship. payne also directed "14th arrondissement" in which a lonely middle-aged post-worker from denver, co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent. payne's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious "tuileries" by joel and ethan coen with (who else? :)) steve buschemi is my absolute favorite. in both shorts, american tourists sit on the benches (margo in the park, and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers) observing the life around them with the different results. while margo may say, "my feeling's sad and light; my sorrow is bright..." steve's character will find out that sometimes, even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country.

it's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project. so refreshing and educating. not only to a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.20 short films about love in paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. i thought the tom tykwer (natalie portman) segment was the best, although the mimes made me smile inside just the same.i clicked on "spoilers" option for this review bus alas...what you read is a spoiler enough. just watch it. don't read what i write, but watch the movie instead.and smile.

diane and i saw this fabulous film today in fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest. i say that because we were entranced by the brief, five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms.ostensibly the film took place in the various parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment. having only been in paris several times, i was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but i am sure europeans and particularly french people could easily recognize the city's locations. in any event, the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in-consequence.the film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen. the stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp hollywood nonsense, they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell, sell. sell ...go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed.

greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights. a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer. we are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie, it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment.the idea is 18 love/relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city. of course, some stand up better than others and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotion. some very known directors are involved, including: the coen brothers, wes craven, alfonso cuaron, alexander payne, gus van sant and gurinda chadha. many familiar faces make appearances as well: steve buscemi, barbet schroeder, catalina sandino moreno, ben gazzara, gena rowlands, gerard depardieu, juliette binoche, willem dafoe, nick nolte, maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins.one of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and the nerdy, yet happy young son of the two mimes. also playing key roles are a red trench coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. don't miss alexander payne (director of "sideways") as oscar wilde.the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch, but as a film, it cannot be termed great. still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer.

delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time, not just from france but from everywhere.my favorite segments:14th arrondissement: carol (margo martindale), from denver, comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her life.montmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic paris.loin du 16ème: an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the cités. ana (catalina sandino moreno) spends more time taking care of somebody else's kid (she's a nanny) than of her own.quartier latin: so much fun to see gérard depardieu as the "tenancier de bar" with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorce.tour eiffel: don't tell me you didn't like those mimes!tuileries: such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist who's making high-contact (a no- no) with a girl in the metro.parc monceau: nick nolte is great. ludivine sagnier also.i've spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!seen in barcelona (another great city), at the verdi, on march 18th, 2007.84/100 (***)

just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection (shot on 35mm, and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k, and projected with 2k projector at etc/usc theater in hwd)..so much for tech stuff. 18 directors (including alexander payne, wes cravens, joel and ethan coen, gus van sant, walter salles and gerard depardieu, among several good french/ international directors) were each given 5 minutes to make a love story. they come in all shapes and forms, with known actors(elijah wood, natalie portman, steve buscemi ..totally hilarious..., maggie glyllenhall, nick nolte, geena rowlands ..soo good..and she actually wrote the piece she was in, msr depardieu and many good international actors as well. the stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex payne's touching study of a woman discovering herself to van sant and one of those things that happens anywhere..maybe? nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences (with english subtitles) and a small amount of actual english spoken, though that will probably relegate it to art houses (a la diva.) also only one piece that might be considered "experimental" but colorful and funny as well, the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships. all easy to follow (unless the "experimental" one irritates your desire for a formulaic story. several brought up some emotions for me...i admit i am affected by love in cinema...when it is presented in something other than sentimentality. i even laughed at a mime piece, like no other i have seen (thank you for that!) the film hit its peak, for me, somewhere around a little more than half way through, then the last two sequences picked up again. some beautiful shots of paris at night, lush romantic kind of music, usually used to good effect, not just schmaltz for "emotions" in sound, generally good cinematography, though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldn't have meant to have been (main character in shot/scene). pacing of each film was good, and overall structure, though a bit long (they left out two of what was to be 20 films, but said all would be on the dvd) seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance. not sure when it comes out, but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work..and sometimes, what doesn't work (if it covers too much time, emotionally, for a short film.) should be in region one when released, but they didn't know when.

rudyard kipling once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. it seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. the result is a wonderful collection of short films, paris je t'aime, in which our guides, van sant, coixet, cuaron, payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations.always some other quarter, always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. and paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?nevertheless, this film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. and its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope.i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing, and by "further development" i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. as far as everything else is concerned i can only say- captivating. makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to paris and live those little romances yourself.

the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts. no problem. this film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast. the segments are devised around the same theme, "love in paris", but the resemblance ends there. actually, considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms, it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film. no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole. this buffet has so many great ingredients, i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish.

i watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in paris. it was my last evening in the french capital and the best good-bye i could have chosen. these twenty episodes made me relive the impressions i had collected in paris in a heart-warming manner without drifting off into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. each episode is full of surprise, strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short-film is directed according to the rules of a good short story. to me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently! the stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly. each episode was seen from a different ankle, had a different topic, a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonic orchestra of films. the most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload, just the other way round: the melange of sadness, melancholy, pure joy, despair, wrath, anxiety, curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony. and not to forget the all over topic of love! love between the characters, love between the characters and paris and also the love of the directors and actors/actresses for this project. i don't want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many, but i must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project. some played with their image, some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before, so intertextuality was given all through the movie. all in all i can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on dvd.

it's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it. although 18 different international directors took the challenge, not everyone of them is good, some of them even boring. but in his entity, "paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, as "love actually" put it, 'love is all around', especially in the city of love. here's a resumé (i'll try to make at as spoiler-free as possible) of the 18 different stories.montmartre - kind of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. a man finds a parking spot, and sees a lot of odd couples walking by, wondering why he can't find a girl. and than, suddenly, a woman faints next to his car...quais de seine - another dull sequence, about three teenage boys who are searching for some 'piece of ass', when suddenly a muslim girl trips right in front of them, receiving help from one of the boys. really basic, but with a sweet heart to it.les marais - this was a huge disappointment! although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great van sant. eventually, everything that comes after the monologue by ulliel is good, everything before it is just annoying.tuileries - an entertaining sequence by the coen brothers. buscemi - without even saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious. this one kept me hooked until the very end, and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie.loin du 16ieme - a beautiful story too, even if the execution is poor, the heart is there. it's the story of an hispanic woman who drops her child off, early in the morning, to take care of another suburban baby. beautiful.porte de choisy - this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie. some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a chinatown-lookalike place in paris. if i understood it correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but i think i'm wrong.bastille - a truly wonderful sequence. a man meets with his wife at a restaurant, to break up with her, so that he can run off with his mistress. but the wife has some devastating news. pretty basic, but truly sad and beautiful! place des victoires - a sad sequence as well. juliette binoche plays a grieving mother. one night, she wakes up hearing her dead child. when she arrives at the location, a cowboy tells her she can give one last good-bye to her child. one of the best segments! tour eiffel - two mimes who fall in love could have been great, but, even though it has some nice cinematic tricks, the story isn't intriguing and not funny at all.parc monceau - a truly original and great sequence, one of the best of the movie! a young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man... cuaron does a great directing job, and the actors are amazing! quartier des enfants rouges - an american actress (gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad ending place des fetes - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts talking romantic to her... because she is the love of his life. beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic,... place des fêtes will make everyone cry.pigalle - a boring sequence between ardant and hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship... very unfunny and unromantic, pigalle is a let-down.quartier de la madeleine - bringing some diversity in the movie, qdlm is a relief. a young guy (wood) finds a vampire killing a victim... the tourist and the vampire... fall in love! dark, scary and oddly romantic, madeleine is superb.pere-lachaise - another let-down segment. directed by wes craven and with stars as mortimer and sewell, it could have been great, but père-lachaise is just ordinary, not original at all.faubourg saint-denis - the rumors are true, twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. a blind man picks up the phone, and hears from his girlfriend (portman - truly stunning) that she breaks up with him. he reflects on their relationship.quartier latin - even though this segment has been co-directed by depardieu and has such stars as rowlands, gazzara and depardieu, this segment is a let-down too. nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors.14th arrondissement - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. an american tells in her french class about her trip to paris. her french is truly terrible, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that paris is so much more than meets the eye.with feist on the background, "paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, not letting me down at all, even though some segments bored the hell out of me, the entity of the movie is great! a true cinematic experience for young and old. paris, je t'aime vraiment!

wasn't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn't disappoint.for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent (which made me feel better about mine) which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie.the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award. the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope.however, the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical. the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible.on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish. it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway.ca vaut la peine!!!

i was lucky enough to attend a screening in stockholm for this elegantly expressed, enjoyable, and thought-provoking film. with romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal, paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in paris, navigating the different forms in eighteen separate "quartiers" but without pouting parisiennes and saccharine formulas. its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors' parts  frustration over only having 5-10 minutes of screen time  thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party.debating whether or not i should review all 18 segments, i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long-winded. instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills, and certainly you'll find your favourite. although gus van sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective, his les marais is one of the better contributions, even sneaking in a well-placed kurt cobain reference. the coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris, a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve buscemi, deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre, and perhaps rightly so. in this way, all story lines are exquisitely unique  filtered through the minds of different directors  but the one that deviates the most from the rest is vincenzo natali's quartier de la madeleine, a dark horror-gothic love starring elijah wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of paris in the night who meets a vampiress. with a black-and-white format but blood-red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen, it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city  a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film. yet my single favourite segment was faubourg saint-denis by tom tykwer but i think i was conditioned to think so, given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying "finally, that's my favourite director here". nevertheless, it cannot be denied that tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone, and hears from his girlfriend (portman - for once not annoying) that she breaks up with him, and he reflects on their relationship. as is tywker's style, the story is dizzyingly fast-paced, kinetic and repetitive, featuring screaming and running (lola rennt) making it the most adrenaline-pumping segment in paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool  music.to fill the negative account, clearly not all directors manage as touching as tywker, van sant, cohens, coixet and dépardieu. sylvain chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met. they are two lonely mimes. this part is so in-your-face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers. suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard-looking juliette binoche whom mourns the loss of her son. nothing else happens. finally, the wrap-up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half-hearted.yet paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality, for all the other stories are well-crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing. it is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 (not saying much, i suppose) and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite. highly recommended both to mainstream of "pretentious" (heh) audiences.8 out 10

although i live in minnesota, i have been studying in france lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film.this movie was amazing, to say the least. a creative and unique film, the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the city of light. the first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline, much as can be done with 2003's love actually. this attempt, however, renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete. when taken at face value, with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film, the love stories together tell a beautiful message.the film is strikingly bizarre at times -- often to the point of confusion -- and each individual segment can be hard to follow. still, to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments, the short plot lines become clear after a short time. the confusion is almost intriguing; it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next. it leaves the viewer wondering "did that really just happen?" yet also leaves them satisfied that it did, indeed, occur. it's the kind of movie where the viewer, upon leaving the theater, can't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it. the initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again, just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece.the interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate. it adds to the reality of the film -- here, the american tourists speak english, the parisians french, and so on. the number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love.from sickness to the supernatural, the love of parents to the love of husbands, this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling. in its beautiful and quirky way, each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story: that of all types, sizes, nationalities, and shapes of love.

i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about- this was a wonderful movie, and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel. the characters are truly young, mary is a strong match for byron, claire is juvenile and a tad annoying, polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant... all are beautiful, curious, and decadent... not the frightening wrecks they are in gothic.gothic works as an independent piece of shock film, and i loved it for different reasons, but this works like a merchant and ivory film, and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like. romantic, yes, but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film. one of my all-time favorites.

i would love to comment on this film. alas , my search has always endeth in vain. if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs; he would, without reservation, be eternally grateful..... blake wrote "the road to excess is the path to wisdom", one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition .... if not, i will have to replay the excellent mr russel's gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer (for better or for worse) have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july 1816 whilst i, a fellow member of this melodious plot, rests his lonely case in solitude ...

in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats. mary and percy shelly,lord byron and others created a entrancing group. showing their quests for sexual enlightenment. personal freedoms from political to moral. liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction. their creative views of life and writing. describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse. along with the distractions and affections each share. with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story. well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful. with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had.

the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie, we were watching it for alex winter of "bill & ted's" fame. we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about.by the time the movie was over, we knew that it was love at first sight. this movie, while not completely historically accurate, was and is the best one of its genre. i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion, none of the others can compare. it fibbed a little at certain details, but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story. i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good, but none as captivating as this one."haunted summer" has the qualities of a painting. the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home. the costumes were gorgeous and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself. the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva (where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there.this movie shows, besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well. yes, there were drugs. it was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. and the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal as well as recreational. shelley suffered from consumption. lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot. it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer. and they were poets during a time when experience was the key. there was no time for prudish caution. passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. and out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: "frankenstein."yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin (not married to shelley at that time) played by beautiful and talented alice krige. she is the control factor to all that goes on until she, too, gives in to experience. but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father.the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. the music fitting. the direction captured the essence of the summer, as i've read about it. this movie was based on a wonderful book "haunted summer" by anne edwards. if you like this movie, read the book. the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story.if you are a person who loves history (even the little inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the gothic, then this is a movie for you. it shows the birth of the birth of the monster, which even today teaches us about the morals of "playing god."a definite must see movie!

summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she's not able to feel and you just cannot understand what she has on her mind. besides, she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century.

a masterpiece.thus it is, possibly, not for everyone.the camera work, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, superb in every way - and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting.summer phoenix creates a deep, believable and intriguing esther kahn. as everything else in this film, her acting is unique - it is completely her own - neither "british" nor "american" nor anything else i have ever seen. there is something mesmerizing about it.the lengthy, unbroken, natural shots are wonderful, reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing.

i have seen the movie at the viennale a few years ago, where the audiences liked it. i liked it as well, summer phoenix performance still haunts me, that´s why i decided to write a comment.the story unfolds in london around 1900, where a jewish girl decides to become an actress. she tries desperately to become one, but it isn´t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being.there were certain reviews, were her performance was smashed, they accused her of being dull, not able to bring life to her character. i think that´s her strong point, that´s exactly what esther kahn should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl. so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise. the cinematography is great, the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was back then. the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie, you loose touch with the characters, after all it´s only about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film. it´s phoenix credit that we don´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour.

this is an extremely dense, somber, and complicated film that unravels quite slowly, revealing excruciating detail, like the attention paid in a novel, and watching this film "is" like watching a novel unfold. while i didn't care for the narrator, as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances, this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen, and the lead, summer phoenix, is fabulous. her innocence and naivete some might find implausible, sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland. i can buy that critique, but she's still fabulous, partially because she's unlike anything i've ever seen before.this film is unbelievably beautiful, filmed by eric gautier, and part of what is so unique about this film is how it doesn't ever show what you'd expect. it's always surprising, and despite it's length, the film never reveals more than it needs to. at 163 minutes, it's extremely concise, to a fault, i'd say, which is one of the wonders of this film. it's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning, some of the best you're likely to see all year, and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience. the family moments are unique, ian holm is brilliant, and what this film has to say about the theater hasn't been seen in films since cassavetes' "opening night," or perhaps chaplin's "limelight." but, believe it or not, this film is much "less" conventional. i never knew where this film was going, and now, having seen it, it still has multiple possibilities. this is a powerful, incredibly provocative film.

esther kahn is a young jewish woman living in an overcrowded, jewish ghetto in 19th century england. she is surrounded by looming, oppressive, dreary, featureless, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, blacked out windows, and hordes of black-and-brown jacketed crowds.she lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment. as child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colourless clothing, shared a bed, and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom.as a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia, exudes a blank, featureless expression, is clothed in plain, unremarkable clothing, and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey, mundane, massively imposing buildings, and narrow streets, and narrow hallways, and narrow doorways, and her loud-mouthed mother and siblings, and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family.her only form of mental escape is the yiddish theatre. sitting in the balcony, front row, leaning over the rail, there is a vast space between her mind and the stage, a space that enables her to breathe, think, feel, and yearn.yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for esther, her face and body remain torpidly somnolent, impassive, dispassionate.the plain and common looking summer phoenix brilliantly conveys esther's emotionless demeanour - summer/esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything.after an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in.she is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays, and meets nathan quellen, portrayed by quintessential british actor ian holm, who commences to teach esther the technical skill of acting.from this point forward, esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel.she begins experiencing emotions she never felt before, and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting.nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitancy, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc; she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life.there are three truths, nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react, and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person.these technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct esther's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement, and emotion.esther kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots, lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the ghetto, and summer phoenix's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature.a must-see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies.

after you've seen this small likable and comical film, you will for sure feel better. cheer to yves b. pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment, that according to me, will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the quebec. the actors isabelle blais, emmanuel bilodeau, sylvie moreau and stéphane gagnon all deliver a touching performance. i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'amélie poulain have given me. so if you've like the jean-pierre jeunet magnificent film, i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b. pelletier, les aimants

this movie is light, funny, and beautifully filmed. the lightning is absolutely superb, and the colours convincingly remind vermeer paintings.this is sentimental comedy at its best, way above us and french standards, and arguably better than english ones too. every character is touching, and interpretation is close to perfection. isabelle blais is splendid, sylvie moreau is better than in the catherine series, stéphane gagnon is charming, emmanuel bilodeau is great in that weird role of his, and geneviève laroche is the perfect best friend!i could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie, so give it a chance, and add your own review.

and i absolutely adore isabelle blais!!! she was so cute in this movie, and far different from her role in "quebec-montreal" where she was more like a man-eater. i think she should have been nominated for a jutra. i mean, syvlie moreau was good, but isabelle was far superior, imo. pelletier has done fine work for his first time out, and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from rock et belles oreilles, guy a. lepage & andre ducharme. it was fun to see them in this, i didn't know they were going to appear.i don't think i've seen a romantic comedy from quebec that i didn't like, and this one is as good as any i've had the pleasure to see. and if you're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd, www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week.

this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada, yves p. pelletier. i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy, but knowing he was a heavy cinephile, was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque, i had a positive feeling about this movie.hell, i was right. right off the bat, the scenario (written by pelletier himself) is a bit twisted and hard to follow, but, in pelletier's fashion it's a one-of-a-kind 90 minutes jack-in-the-box.loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons (by laclos) "les aimants" consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge. throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who's who and who's writing to who on that goddam fridge....which pops up in an interesting love affair.great storyline, great photography, great quotations of other movies. should we ask more for a first movie?

highly regarded at release, but since rather neglected. immense importance in the history of performing arts. a classic use of embedded plots. one of my favourite films. why hasn't the soundtrack been re-released?

carlos saura's carmen is one of the finest achievements in world, let alone spanish, cinema. it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force. at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer/director and the principle dancers. the fine line between life and art is dazzling.

personally, i think that the film was done very professionally, i loved the choreography and the acting. the plot is also gripping and mysterious. the film itself is very emotional, and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards. antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end, and i must say that it's one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director.

i've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it's still great every time i see it. it's a very compelling version of the opera carmen, with amazing flamenco dancing, bare bones sets, and, of course, wonderful music.this telling of carmen is a story within a story, with each paralleling the other, until the doubly tragic ending. obviously a low budget spanish production, the film contains dancing by some of spain's premier flamenco dancers. the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage, makes the telling of the story even more powerful.it's independent movie making at it's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film.

this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class. if you are a fan of the opera, this film will strongly entertain you. of course, the dancing is wonderful. watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out.

i first saw this movie when it was released in the u.s. in 1984. i have seen it many, many times since. what strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa. throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal. this continues up to the climax of the film. all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not "carmen" is really stabbed at the end. from the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. the passion of the dance, the quality of the acting, the love of art, and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that, once again, blends and twists the line between life and art.

passionate, dramatic, riveting as flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing. it is set on the immortal bizet's music. the original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists, leading proponent of the modern flamenco style, paco de lucia who plays a musician with the same name. legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer antonio gades co/wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated georges bizet/prosper mérimée novella/opera. he plays a main character antonio, the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of carmen in the flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers.brilliant and graceful cristina hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role. hoyos had been the first dancer in gades' company for twenty years (1968-1988) and she was the protagonist of three films that carlos saura made of gades' three great shows: "bodas de sangre" (1978), "carmen" (1983) and "el amor brujo" (1985). gorgeous laura del sol is a young dancer named carmen in whom antony sees from the first sight another carmen, who was immortalized by two frenchmen, the writer prosper mérimée in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired george bizet's world famous opéra-comique version from 1875.as in the opera and in the novella, carmen in saura's film is desirable and deadly, the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else. she could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission. there some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen, and as different as they are, they all have in common the only possible tragic end. saura/gades' film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly spanish. i fell in love with it from the first time i saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then. highly recommended.

while rehearing carmen of bizet, the middle-aged choreographer antonio (antonio gades) brings the sexy carmen (laura del sol) to perform the lead role. antonio falls in love for carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. when carmen has an affair with another dancer, antonio is consumed by his jealousy like d. josé in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality."carmen" is another great movie of carlos saura's trilogy dedicated to the flamenco dance. the dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). paco de lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of prosper mérimée. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "carmen"

the movie within the movie - a concept done many times in the history of cinema. it is accomplished here as well as in any.if you love carmen, you'll love this version.if you love flamenco, you'll love this version.the plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe. the music is authentic. the direction wonderful.if you like dancing, you'll love this version.there is tragedy. there is passion. there is intrigue.there is...carmen.

in carmen, saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction, between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional carmen, the famous fatal mix of a free spirit (read disregard for fidelity) and her ability to drive men mad with desire. saura used this same vehicle fiction/reality in an earlier black-and-white film, bodes de sangre (blood wedding). but, whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing blood wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles, in carmen, the parallel between the petty, libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic carmen never comes even close to being believable. it remains a gadget, and, for that reason, a bothersome distraction. one really needs to see blood wedding next to carmen to appreciate the comparison. however, it hardly matters, the melodrama saura tries to impose upon his carmen, because the flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals_ which are 95% of the film _by some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians, more than repays the price of entry. a flawed film, and a wonder: perfect for doing a drill in keats's 'negative capacity', perhaps?

carmen is one of the best films i've ever seen. it's hard to say whose performance is best: antonio gades, cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb.they dance their souls out. it's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth; myth penetrates everyday life. dance becomes life and entire life is danced out. real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else, act out the parts of lovers of old. the magic is continuing.

this is an amazing film, both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing, and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it. spellbinding is the only word i can use to describe the experience. this is not 'bizet's carmen' by any usual standard. this is not a usual film by any standard. every nuanced glance, every stomp of the foot, every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can't take your eyes off the screen. you don't need to love opera or flamenco(i don't)to be captured, enraptured, enthralled by this film. subtle and direct; loud and still; one of, if not the best, movies of it's kind, because there are so few like it.

as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale, this film with the new bond starring in it was shown, from director roger michell (notting hill). i almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but i'm glad i stuck with it. basically may (anne reid) is a single mother of helen (anna wilson-jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend, darren (daniel craig, of course). after knowing each other only a few days, may and darren have a secret affair. and at her age, with a 30-something, and the new bond?! anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out. when she does, darren gets less hassle than may. in fact, helen asks her permission to hit her. also starring peter vaughan as toots, danira govich as au pair, harry michell as harry, rosie michell as rosie and johnny english's oliver ford davies as bruce. very good!

watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance. the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey, as i tuned in there's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by daniel craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent.it turns out that eponymous mother's carpenter love interest is also the daughter's boyfriend, so there's trouble brewing and not too many surprises. but i'd been caught by anne reid's compelling performance and i was hooked. the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves, when she exudes sadness.the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking. shouldn't older women's bodies remain covered up? not here and we're treated to a delicious reawakening in the mother's sexuality. even more startling are the drawings she's made that (spoiler!) once discovered confirm her daughter's suspicion that something's going on here.cathryn bradshaw as the daughter didn't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast, but that could be me. with her waves of pre-raph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla, whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind. bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didn't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses.the ending is weak. if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons. whatever she's done, she's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years, and i found the lack of sympathy jarring. for a film so full of emotion (and be warned it's like opening champagne, you'll never get the lid back on) the ending is a cold contradiction.

i am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film, any comment would much greatly appreciated. the comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. so if you have any views at all, im sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an a! i am also studying 'about a boy' and 'tadpole' so if you have seen these films as well, i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page. thank you.

the mother is one of those films that you know is good, maybe even great, but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in.the story is potentially distasteful in many ways: the death of a character within the first half hour, the december-may romance, the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother, the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters, the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives. this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003, but is a throw back to a collection of british (usually made-for-tv) movies from the late 1980's - it has a moral severity that never lets up, which produces an enveloping throbbing angst.the mother is flawless, but that is in part the problem; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script, some lesser actors - it takes the edge off, but if such a film is so pitch perfect, the experience of watching it is raw and painful. even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer ache; the london in this movie is bright and open, filled with harsh, cutting light.if you are tough as nails, or are one of those super-sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut-wrenching sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared to squirm. and be warned: as tough as the movie is from beginning to near-end, the worst is to come.toward the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it (for having slept with her boyfriend), and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her. the mother agrees to this, they both stand up, and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer's blow. argh!!!

this is a really interesting film. it's the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being sensationalist. for the director of notting hill this is a bold move to something serious

"the mother" tells of a recently widowed mid-60's mother of two adult children (reid) who, on the heels of her husband's death, finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. the film dwells on the quietly passive mom, her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter, the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover, and the convolutions arising therefrom. a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents, "the mother" does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism. will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women, who may better empathize with the central character, her needs and issues. (b+)

may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and "kids" don't really seem to know each other as one might expect. the warmth that should be there is missing. after dinner, may's husband says he doesn't feel well, blames it on his daughter's cooking, and irritably says he wants to go home. he dies that night.may, now a widow, is lost. she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. she had someone who needed her, and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years, she had something to do with her days.she is depressed and unmotivated. she goes to stay with her daughter, paula, who shortly after her mother's arrival, lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all. she lets loose with anger over her mother's lack of nurturing. may seems disarmed and surprised, yet she also doesn't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right. "i'm your mother and i love you." what does really say? (i've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means.) paula is a bit (well, more than a bit) neurotic. both women are needy, though they show it very differently.paula has been involved with a friend of her son's, darren, who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son. while paula is working during the day, may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren. darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son, nicky, but supposedly doesn't live in the home with his wife.may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have. darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life. (he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to "get away from it all," though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey. they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day, and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years, nor had ever expected to know again. as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren, this becomes part of may's rationalization that what she is doing is okay.at a writing group that paula leads, may is introduced, rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted. there is one scene where she has sex with the older man, who clearly can barely perform, and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may's face as she endures the one-time ghastly liaison.eventually, paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother, that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex.this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways. sympathies will be divided. at one point, during paula's writing group, may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day, and would leave for pubs after they were asleep, making sure to get back home before her husband.clearly, a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub. may, however, also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband didn't like her having any friends, so she didn't have any. she did what he wanted her to do. she was miserable but she put up with it because, as she said, "it was easier." so, while may was not the best mother, for those inclined to have any sympathy for her, one might see may's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for "a few minutes" in her lifetime. a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, to know her as a human being, to have a friend and a lover.paula, though neurotic and unhappy, perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her. certainly, it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother.it is a well-done film, with more complexities than i have mentioned, and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps conflicting, reactions. it is a film worth discussing and debating, and above all, worth seeing.one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life. no matter who is deemed "right" or who is deemed 'wrong" by each viewer, that theme of old age and loneliness, evoking a sense of dread in most of us, is inescapable.

"if i sit down i will never stand up again", that's what the mother (the one of the title) says to his son when he tells her to get some rest (she's just widowed). he means that resting is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do: to rest in peace, to neglect herself. but she's not in the mood for "resting", not yet. she also has a daughter who reproaches her for each and every disasters in her life... suddenly, the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (daniel craig, the brand new james bond) when she "thought nobody would ever touch her again". it is a story that makes you reflect on many things, specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies. it doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects. i mean, nobody's surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones... but what would you think if it was otherwise? an old woman, a young guy... nah, you ain't ready for that, are you?the movie has intimist tones all along its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul-mouthed dialogs. those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair (pretty absurd -you'll know what i mean when you watch it-) are the only discordant elements in "the mother". *my rate: 7/10

while movie titles contains the word 'mother', the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children.however, the mother tells a different story.the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child. here, notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond, here, he plays darren, a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother, and sleeping with her daughter as well. anne reid, who was a familiar face on tv series, takes up the challenging role of the leading character, may.the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband, toots, in a family visit to her son, bobby. while she befriends darren, a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby's house, she was shocked to found out that her daughter, paula, was sleeping with darren. at the same time, may was coping with life after the death of toots. fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her, may starts to find her life going off track, until she spends her afternoon with darren.darren was nice and friendly to may, and may soon finds some affection on darren. instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple. later, may found sexual pleasure from darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on. this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her, where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may, as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series. as she do not have much movies in her career resume, the mother has put her on the critic's attention. daniel craig, on the other hand, had took on a similar role in his movie career, such as sylvia (2003) and enduring love (2004). if his reprising role of james bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career, and the mother is one of them.the mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam.

"the mother" is a weird low-budget movie, touching at least two uncomfortable themes not usually explored in the cinema: denial of love of mother for their own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age.the characters are awful: may is a disgusting old lady and i believe it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or sorrow for her. she confesses that she did not love her son and her daughter. she cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. she steals the beloved man of her daughter, not to protect her from a guy without moral, that does not love her, but just because she feel horny with him. she is trying to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, destroying her daughter delusions. paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life the way it is. her brother bobby is a man who lost his savings because of his wife, who insists in having her shop, a terrible business indeed. darren is an amoral addicted jerk who does not like anybody, even himself.the acting and direction are excellent: the actresses and actors have outstanding performances and the direction is very precise. i liked this movie, but i recognize that it is recommended for very specific audiences. my vote is seven.title (brazil): "recomeçar" ("re-start")

i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place. however, the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people. the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film, the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards. there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better. all in all, this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. it's a thrilling and interesting movie experience.

kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. recent adapted travesty's like 'intimacy' have ruined great writing. but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnations, eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette. a middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter. the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing. and in daniel craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother. beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it's a winner.

with the death of her infirmed husband, may, an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible, dead from the neck down, and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son, bobby and his shallow wife, helen, and paula, a self- absorbed, clinging, and minimally talented daughter. the central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband. the mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies, the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else. as may comes to realize the world is still important to her, the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter's boyfriend, a carpenter and rough sort. may embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first, but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him.this is the kind of role hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them, but would never appear in because the film's frankness, overt sexuality, unglamorous wardrobe, little makeup, and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society most film industry women are enchrenched. the performance by the lead actress, anne reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face-lift, hair extensions, and liposuction. she bares more than her soul for the screen.daniel craig is the enabling handyman, derrek who beds both mother and daughter. he turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow's situation, but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen-house. his aimless character's inability to say no to the ex-wife, boring girlfriend, and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence. while good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life.one of the best films from britain in years, it is simply adult in its storyline. the mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for american audiences to tolerate having no car chase, no bling, no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by tv starlets and buff studmuffins. the mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook, send to the retirement home, and get out of the way. may doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by darren, isn't willing to go to the old folks home, and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age.

what a moving film. i have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore, and she longs for companionship. being in my late 40s i am beginning to see what she has been complaining about. you are no longer youthful, beautiful or touchable. when may says "...this lump of a body..." wow. how our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful. i love when she begins to change what she wears...the colorful scarf...no longer the frumpy wife.it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. sad in that may betrays her daughter's trust...beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair, and chooses to move on and finally have her own life. i love the character's daring to even initiate the love affair.mostly i love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships, be they familial or not. we see paula's vulnerability, yet she will have what she wants at all costs...(when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if darren even wants a child). the movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change, and yet reveals what has been there all along, dormant. may has stifled her own creativity to raise a family. a family that she didn't really want, but was "something you just did when she was young". i love the scene when darren calls her an old tart, and she smiles and says "i was never called that before". it was truly a gem of a movie.and daniel craig. well, i just love him. i was pleasantly surprised. not only is he pleasant on the eyes, he is a real talent. what a neat role. he is much more than any 007 that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature. the scene where he is pleasuring may and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman, and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her. he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. a wonderful scene. the contrast is the love scene with bruce. bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure...two completely different men.alas...i wonder where is my darren?

i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. i can honestly say that i cannot remember another intimate dramatic film, which does so many things so well. the writing is crisp, realistic, nuanced, and even restrained. the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired, enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways. the acting is also wonderful, with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer. they reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. a real triumph for roger michell and hanif kureishi, and the rest of the team. a must see for serious film lovers.

i am embarrassed to say that i missed "the mother" when it was in theaters. i saw it this evening on dvd. i gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few i have given here. this english independent is filmed with such great care and quality. it drew me in relentlessly. the story, low-keyed and purely human, is brutally honest and utterly absorbing, thanks to the acting of anne reid, daniel craig and cathryn bradshaw. the cinematography is stunning. the score is hard-wired to the plot. the storyline is epic, brilliantly clothed by writer hanif kureishi in mundane lives. this story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. and some of those big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many nominations. it is simply one of my all-time favorite films.

wow. saw this last night and i'm still reeling from how good it was. every character felt so real (although most of them petty, selfish a**holes) and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughter's feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing. top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the north's daniel craig (the latter coming across as the next david thewlis).and director roger michell? this is as far from notting hill as it's possible to be. thank god.watch this movie!!!

this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity. anne reid, previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including 'dinnerladies' (a victoria wood scripted series on in-company catering workers, if you're wondering), gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may, a late-60s bereaved mother of two chattering class adults in an inner-london borough. her husband toots (peter vaughan) dies on their visit to the male of the latter species (bobby), and we see the pair being rather casually greeted by bobby and his family. may's teacher daughter paula (cathryn bradshaw) lives nearby, however, and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer. thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london, she is able to stay in paula's house and do some child-minding of paula's more appreciative offspring.it is on may's visits to bobby's house that she embarks on an affair with darren, a mid-30s friend of bobby who is working on a house extension. in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it, it is may and not darren (daniel craig*) who initiates the encounter, and, at least to begin with, it seems that the relationship is founded on mutual respect. there is no explicit sexual content (at least in the dvd i saw: differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions), and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not exploitatively. more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula, a recent convert to 'therapy and self-exploration', who announces that mummy has never been supportive of her. paula is also darren's lover, and when she finds may's explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together, things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion. only in an english film, perhaps, could a daughter announce that she is going to hit her mother, politely ask her to stand up, and duly wallop her.in the mean time, may is being drawn into a putative relationship with a decent but older (of her own generation) member of paula's writing group. the contrast between the ensuing unwanted intercourse and her affair with darren is clearly made; it is at that point that may starts to acquiesce to paula, and darren's worm begins to turn (he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money, if not all along, but for some of the ride). so may finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs, and finally does return home (but later leaves on a jet plane for pastures new).the film's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent-sibling relationships, where bereavement may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no-one to care for them. this is not new, but the openness of the portrayal of sexual need in the over-60s may well be. the darkness of the film's content, from a screenplay by hanif kureishi, stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit (it seems to be perpetual summer), and the overall mood is uplifting - it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a dour and rainy england. the ending is perhaps under-written, as we don't know where may is going or for how long - perhaps she's shirley valentine with a pension, she's certainly no picasso. anne reid is, however, revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever. like julie andrews in torn curtain (said by paul newman), "there goes your mary poppins {read dinnerladies} image for good".* yes, he: announced oct 2005 as the new james bond.

at the beginning of the film we watch may and toots preparing for their trip to london for a visit to their grown children. one can see toots is not in the best of health, but he goes along. when he dies suddenly, may's world, begins to spin out of control.the film directed by roger michell, based on a screen play by hanif kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure comes to terms with her new status in life and her awakening into a world that she doesn't even know it existed until now.may's life as a suburban wife was probably boring. obviously her sexual life was next to nothing. we get to know she's had a short extra marital affair, then nothing at all. when may loses her husband she can't go back home, so instead, she stays behind minding her grandson at her daughter's home. it is in this setting that may begins lusting after young and hunky darren, her daughter's occasional lover.darren awakes in may a passion she has not ever known. may responds by transforming herself in front of our eyes. may, who at the beginning of the film is dowdy, suddenly starts dressing up, becoming an interesting and attractive woman. she ends up falling heads over heels with this young man that keeps her sated with a passion she never felt before.having known a couple of cases similar to this story, it came as no surprise to me to watch may's reaction. her own chance of a normal relationship with bruce, a widower, ends up frustratingly for may, who realizes how great her sex is with darren. the younger man, we figure, is only into this affair to satisfy himself and for a possibility of extorting money from may. finally, the daughter, helen discovers what mum has been doing behind her back when she discovers the erotic paintings her mother has made.the film is a triumph for the director. in anne reid, mr. michell has found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to the role of may. also amazing is daniel craig. he knows how darren will react to the situation. anna wilson jones as helen is also vital to the story as she is the one that has to confront the mother about what has been going on behind her back. oliver ford davies plays a small part as bruce the older man in helen's class and is quite effective.the film is rewarding for those that will see it with an open mind.

a woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son's friend and handy man. in a slightly twisted story, the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself. the twisted part? the handy man is also her daughter's on and off love interest.as if this wasn't strange enough, the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother.though you may think badly of this woman, the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light. beautifully played by anne reid, this character has dimension and portrays great emotion.a truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film.8/10

'the mother' is that extraordinary piece of film making - it gets you thinking, it pulls no punches - and ultimately it leaves you thinking. very much open-ended as to the lead character's fate. anne reid (which i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria wood-led projects and thought a fine comedienne) is truly superb here. not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. and not all that free-spirited and adventurous at first. she plays her character just with the right note that rings true (well, it did to me). powerful cast. great script. renaissance of european cinema indeed ;)

although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate, i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.the story is revealed slowly and realistically. the acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. i tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and i was always wrong, so i was very intrigued by the story.i highly recommend this movie. and i must confess, i'll forever look at my mom in a different light!

[warning: contains spoilers]i have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy. she came to mind when i reflected on the audience's reaction to "the mother." people gasped when may (anne reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, darren (daniel craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may. i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.screenwriter hanif kureishi ("my beautiful laundrette," "my son the fanatic") again proves why he's among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the atlantic. his story's not easy to take. this searing family drama isn't a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it's raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. nevertheless, it's powerfully good stuff.kureishi and roger michell (who directed "notting hill," of all things) craft an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly-acted portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all of life's pleasures. in a wonderfully epiphanous moment, when her son, bobby, asks her not to be difficult, may shoots back, "why not?"why not, indeed.anne reid deserves an oscar nomination for her turn as may. it's subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. watch reid when may observes darren and paula (cathryn bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. or, when she begs paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. reid's eyes and face reveal all of may's anguish and despair. in the film's most devastating moment, may drops to her knees before darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind. this is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.i enjoyed michell's use of natural sound, especially when may and toots first arrive at bobby's place. it perfectly illustrated the cacophony around may and toots, the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.this film, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of mike leigh's work, except "the mother" hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.my one quibble: michell's decision to give may and darren's first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. the lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. and the only sound is of may in the throes of passion.the problem with michell's approach is that both reid and craig, who completely envelops the role of darren, plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it's unfair to hide their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. especially since michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.this film doesn't have immensely likable characters. we sympathize with may, but she, too, causes her daughter's suffering. but i doubt kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. his point, i believe, was to unmask a family that's already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. it's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.

a fierce, shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote "my beautiful laundrette", (this is the best thing he's done since then). it's about intelligent people whose lives don't add up to much. they've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. this is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. in some respects it's a bit like "sunday, bloody sunday" but it's an altogether tougher piece of work. the director, roger michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. and it is beautifully acted.as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance, and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi hasn't tapped into. if the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. the film is also extremely beautiful to look at (dop alwin kuchler) and must rank, unhesitatingly, as the best british film of the year.

it's hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as 'notting hill' pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this, but well, here's the evidence and it's quite compelling. several have alluded to tv drama, and yes, this does have a seventies play for today feel at times, but is always a cut above, mainly i think owing to some quite superlative acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadow-boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose, except maybe right at the end. (i didn't like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway, nor the oh-what-a-beautiful-morning final scene: she deserved a more studied finale than that i think, after all that hard work. the slippers business was a bit ott too, on reflection).what i mean about avoiding cliché: well, i for one had a sinking expectation that the "mature" man may's daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in 2 dimensions as a repulsive old bore, so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive, virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with. instead, we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely, clumsy, not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow, who nevertheless doesn't have much of a clue about entertaining a woman. it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention. here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts. almost mike leigh in that respect (minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in for).and of course i was, as everyone probably was, dumbfounded by what anne reid does with her character and with her body. she's /not/ "the repressed, dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time", this is far too simplistic for the character we have. again and again there are allusions to her having been a "bad housewife", not to mention that thing she does with trays, trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward. the daughter accuses her of having "sat in front of the tv all day" instead of, well, whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been: she has no answer. she never was a model wife and mother, at least not to herself - that's where a lot of the poignancy comes from, the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasn't good at, ever.

kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents' sex lives. and grown-up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido. lastly, many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy, frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age."the mother" is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who isn't ready to stay home, watch "the telly," and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades, and a controlling, dominating chap at that, packs it in with a massive heart attack.may (anne reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in his or her own way. the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture. paula (cathryn bradshaw), is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer. she's attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first.back at her house after burying her husband, may determines to not stay there. rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure, she goes to stay with paula who has a young son. paula's boyfriend, darren (daniel craig), is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may's son's house. may is quite taken with hard-drinking, coke-sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was, for sure, a fellow of the royal academy of cads.what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive (dare i say reborn?) widow. the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama (or debacle, take your pick).the theater in manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may's age. that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement. this blindingly honest look at an older woman's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband's desire that she stay at home and raise kids (she also mentions he didn't like her to have friends-what a guy) surfaces a number of issues. while may's dalliance with darren doesn't constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and issues, with a mother bedding her daughter's lover. and paula isn't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with. the affair, once disclosed, allows the peeling open of the mother-daughter relationship which, from paula's viewpoint, left something to be desired. ms. bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love-she hasn't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn't a bed of roses either.may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect, indeed demand, a future of happiness. but she is also inescapably vulnerable. she's fishing in uncharted emotional waters. who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand, much less resolve. in her sixties, she's still a work in progress."something's gotta give" recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited. after all it's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich. and to insure that no serious psycho-social issues were explored, keaton's young girlfriend, amanda peet, daughter of keaton, not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er) would-be lover never hopped into the sack.no easy out here. anne reid's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others. her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views).kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy.9/10.

the tenants began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written. as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real: as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green (who also directs) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments.harry lesser (dylan mcdermott) is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing. convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel (seymour cassel) who constantly tries to 'buy out' harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished. into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasi-anti-semitic writer willie spearmint (snoop dogg) whom harry befriends, hides, and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people. harry's attempts to help willie lead to conflict, not the least of which is harry's meeting willie's girlfriend, the white jewish irene bell (rose byrne) at a less than friendly gathering of willie's militant black brothers and sisters. willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel. when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry, willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers. the ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition, and the human capacity for violence and undoing'.the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters. the cinematography enhances the story, keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building. the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters. though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings, the film in the end is worth watching. at least it attempts to recreate malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city. grady harp

being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick. i remember he was interviewed on "jay leno," and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget adam sandler comedy "the longest yard" to be in this film. so obviously, snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. i'm not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in "the tenants." there are certainly better rapper/actors, like mos def, who could've done more with his role. but the point is snoop did a "good" job. he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing. the point is i found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating. mcdermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's not-so-subtle acting. being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, i couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating. it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work, and berate him for criticizing it. but you know what? i'm sure a lot of writers are like that. his character was supposed to be flawed, as was mcdermott's, in his own way. my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending. for some reason, it just felt too rushed for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot.

rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot, an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution. one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary. if you can put aside rohmer's unabashed defense of the monarchy (and that is not an easy thing to do, given that, for instance, the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts), this is actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of 18th century france, rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards. it is a blatantly artificial conceit, but it somehow works. and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be.

i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of l'anglaise, in this beautifully acted, intellectually and visually compelling film. thank you so much, monsieur le directeur rohmer.

rohmer strays from his usual portraits of french middle class to tell this costume drama about the difficulties of an aristocrat lady during the french revolution. what's more attractive about "la anglaise..." (apart from the story itself) is the fabulous aesthetics that rohmer has achieved. the images have been digitally decorated too make them look like baroque pictures. in some moments you can't really say whether your watching a movie or a series of pictures in louvre musseum. every shot is like a piece of art.*my rate: 7.5/10------------------------------ --------------------------------

erich rohmer's "l'anglaise et le duc" makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins' "la commune (paris 1871)." both films -screened at this year's toronto international film festival- ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale. ironic, given the tragic events that were taking place in the u.s. during the festival.set in paris during the french revolution, the movie, based on grace elliott's (lucy russell) "memoirs," is a first-hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days. she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans (played by jean-claude dreyfus), who, in contrast to herself, is a supporter of the revolution.true to form, you don't know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on. one of the earliest of the french "new wave" filmmakers, rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative. after all, in the midst of the rebelling-youth-viet-nam days of the late 60s and 70s, he was filming romantic little confections like "claire's knee." but don't sell the old boy short, folks, he's always been a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and "l'anglaise et le duc" continues to bear this out.rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" nor the "good guys'; they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities -and limitations. that's why his movies are always provocative, and this film is no exception.now for the technological nuts and bolts.rohmer, though making his way into his 80s, is still on the cutting-edge of cinematic innovation. the look of "l'anglaise" is like something you've never seen before. you guessed it, the old guy -like several of the festival's directors this year- has gone digital.all of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s parisian settings. as a matter of fact, you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological -and yes, i'll say it- political insights.toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year, as well as some of the world's oldest. and the old masters are standing there on cinema's cutting-edges right alongside the young ones.long live youth. long live old age. and long live erich rohmer.

anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies. this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment. why? because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis. i repeat--intelligent dialogue! that is what characterizes nearly all of rohmer's films, and that is why a lot of people don't like them. they prefer action. fine, let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like this.rohmer has always been accused of being "talky." well, he is, but to me that's a compliment, not a criticism. shakespeare was talky, too. is there a talkier play than "hamlet?" whenever the subject, or theme, of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values, there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values, an that is largely what this film is all about. aristocracy and noble birth vs. egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path; the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life, even if the person possessing that life is not so nice, or even despicable. (anyone ever hear of dostoyevsky, or "crime and punishment?") these are what this film is all about.the two leads in this film are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. lucy russell, who is english and speaks french as her second language, is especially brilliant. do yourself a favor and see this riveting film. it may be the last film by this screen master.

eric rohmer's "the lady and the duke". could have used a better translation for the title. "the english woman and the duke", perhaps, would have been more accurate. while it's obvious this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments to this forum, it is worth watching because in spite of the intricate pattern of the story, mr. rohmer has created a movie that could be seen as an art exhibit in a museum. the mixed technology used in the movie, ultimately, works well.the strange story of grace elliott, a noble lady who had been the mistress of the king of england and of the french duc d'orleans, holds our attention. the setting is paris during the days that followed the french revolution. the country was in turmoil and the power was in the hands of the people, who couldn't care less for the aristocrats. the images show the agitators running around with heads of famous people right after their trip to the guillotine.grace relation with the duc had ended, but she remains a true friend to the great man that is in danger, himself, of losing his own head. grace moves through all the horrors around her without being able of an escape. she even has an enemy in her own house, in the form of the cook, pulcherie, who would not hesitate to denounce her at the least provocation.watching the movie, at times, gives the viewer the impression one is going on a trip through the louvre watching those huge canvases that depict this crucial era of the french history. rather than finding the digitalization process distracting, we found it to enhance the film in many ways.lucy russell, as grace elliott, does a fine job to portray this woman who saw a lot during her lifetime. her french seems to be excellent, as it appears she is fluent in it. as the duc d'orleans, jean claude dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort. the supporting cast also was great. as an ensemble piece mr. rohmer gets good performances all around.for lovers of history, "the lady and the duke" will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to the vision of eric rohmer.

this is quite an amazing film to watch. using digital technology, the director, rohmer, has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops. most of the time this works brilliantly, especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life. it is less successful in a few scenes, where it limits camera angles (they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example) but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as history itself. it is narrated using the memoirs of the duc d'orleans' ex- mistress, grace elliott. so, an event usually claimed as one of their own by marxist historians, especially in france, is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner. inevitably a different point of view emerges -there can be no objective representation. the use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality. personally, i found the story line around the king's death the most interesting. a staunch royalist she is shocked when the duc votes for the king's death (a basic knowledge of the french revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between grace and the duc here. he was louis's cousin and had himself elected to the assembly, where he promptly changed his name to philip equality). the filming of louis's death is masterly. grace and her maidservant are in meudon, out of paris, watching from a hill with a telescope. we do not see the execution, we only hear the maid's commentary, like grace. the most dramatic event of the revolution happens off screen. grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed. her view is that of an aristocrat. any justification of louis's death is literally beyond her vision. this is powerful, keenly intelligent film making. the love story between the duc and grace is insinuated, never told, and is powerfully moving (tho the duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times; what does she see in him? no accounting for taste). the undercurrents of madness (simply existing being enough to be a suspect) that sweep individuals along in a time such as the revolution are illustrated as grace's life is turned upside down, her house is searched daily, yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself! if you have any interest at all in a subtle, well told film, making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale, or the representation of a pivotal moment in europe's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman, its ultimate outsider, then this is well worth your time. it is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded.

sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip. the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives. this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne. the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.

obviously written for the stage. lightweight but worthwhile. how can you go wrong with ralph richardson, olivier and merle oberon.

i had really only been exposed to olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *divorce*. in this film, he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy merle oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm.

a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort "the divorce of lady x (1938)" . it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon, before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors. and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy, it all flows along nicely. oberon is leslie, a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan's (olivier) hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel. she does everything possible to irritate him--but, in the crazy way films go, he falls for her. and she falls for him. but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon's "lady x" (that's all she leaves oliver in a note) is thought by olivier to be a married woman. to make matters worse, and more amusing, lord mere (ralph richardson) goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon! there is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics. you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy, but in true olivier he's a consummate professional, and delivers. and he handles the screwball twists and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. oberon was no great shakes as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her, worked well with olivier. this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson), but perhaps the print needs cleaning up.

an incredible little english film for so many reasons. first it's a rare look a laurence olivier in a light comedy. while his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister. historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot. being english it didn't have the big budget of the hollywood films of the same era and it often shows, but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an england that would soon be gone. when we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest american counter part `it happened one night' were in their day as risqué as `fatal instinct' was in our time. but after watching and enjoying this movie the first time i can't help but feel sadness when i watch it today. with half of film shoot before 1950 gone, saving the remaining films means hard choices, and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important. the color shifting, lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking. this movie along with `it happened one night' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch, or better yet why not a double feature.

laurence olivier, merle oberon, ralph richardson, and binnie barnes star in "the divorce of lady x," a 1938 comedy based on a play. olivier plays a young barrister, everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. the next day, a friend of his, lord mere (richardson), announces that his wife (barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. believing the woman to be oberon, olivier panics. oberon, who is single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she's the lady in question, lady mere, when she's really leslie steele.we've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. with this cast, it's delightful. i mean, richardson and olivier? olivier and oberon, that great team in wuthering heights? pretty special. olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight, nervous barrister. oberon gives her role the right light touch. she looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. she wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries on, with that hair-do, she's ready to play snow white. binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere.the color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration. definitely worth seeing.

this is an absolutely charming film, one of my favourite romantic comedies. it's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful. though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre. he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor, who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways, to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly. the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting. ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well. i highly recommend it.

i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when i discovered this gem. i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time.

lawrence olivier and merle oberon did two movies together within two years. one is considered one of the great romantic films of all time, and the movie that made olivier a great movie star (and gave oberon her best performance role): wuthering heights. the other is this film, made in england a year earlier. the divorce of lady x is a romantic comedy (as wuthering heights is a romantic tragedy). olivier is a lawyer, everard logan, who is a dynamic barrister, but is also a total misogynist. one night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. it is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that london was known for up until a notorious "killer" fog in the 1950s), and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. the management tries to get logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms, but he refuses. but he has not reckoned with merle oberon as leslie steele. the granddaughter of a high court judge, she manages to get into logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there, but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).the next day they share a breakfast, and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women logan finds leslie very attractive. but she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. she is determined to learn more about him, and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. in the meantime, logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (ralph richardson as lord mere) as a potential client. mere suspects his wife lady mere (binnie barnes) of having an affair. in fact, he tells logan her ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that lady mere was his mysterious roommate that night. i will not go into the plot any further, except to say that leslie eventually realizes what a mistake logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.the script has the feel of a wodehouse novel, but is slighter. still the performances of olivier, oberon, richardson, barnes, and morton selden (as oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. it shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what i mean: selden's first scene, complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet, who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years). or olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office, who is certain there were two lady meres in the office two minutes before (there were, but oberon and barnes left together), and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton. or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man. as i said, a slight charming comedy - but it is very charming.

cecil b. demille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western comes across as the real mccoy, engrossing, entertaining, spectacular; in no way outdated.as a real fan of tv's deadwood, i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more on-target.we don't have any giants in hollywood anymore. plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade: released, re-issued, re-issued all over again. filmmakers like today's spielberg, jackson, bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox. none of today's movies will be sought out in 7 months let alone 70 years.

this isn't masterpiece theater. you shouldn't go into it expecting that. this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads. like someone else here said, this is the film baby mama was meant to be. and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. the film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.

anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film. it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a "spring break movie" plus it makes fun of the college film genre. it's funny, it's got a cast to die for (amy pohler! rachel dratch!, sophie monk!, parker posey! jane lynch! amber tamblyn! missi pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. writer/ actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain. wilson phillips! omg! (i'm just repeating myself now...) it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb.

i don't think this movie is for everyone. but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny. i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time. i thought the entire cast did a great job. you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene. i suspect some moviegoers (especially the ones who take themselves way too seriously) will be turned off by this brand of humor. not me. the movie was a real surprise. and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change. i cannot wait to see it again! if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you. funny funny funny funny!

let's set one thing straight: this movie does not seek to redefine the genre, it's not dr. strangelove o young frankenstein. it's a silly flick, with three great female leads (can't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey, charming as ever. the story is basic: the three gals were "losers" in college, and are still after wards it. poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind guy), posey is an assistant for a senator (who "hasn't been touched by a man since clinton was in office"... i catched that one several minutes later... i'm a little slow, ok!), and dracht has a gay fiancée (seth meyers from snl, funny). they have to prevent the "uncool" daughter of the senator (the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series "joan of arcadia") to embarrass her during spring break. so of course they have to go to watch over her, and some hilarity ensues. all in all, a light, simple comedy, quite short, and quite enjoyable

reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when i watched it i could not stop laughing! it has officially become my new favourite movie.i don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. this one was almost all women - with the exception of seth meyers, justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett - and it worked. all of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially missi pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.the charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and i have to agree. everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.

the master of movie spectacle cecil b. de mille goes west. using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock,james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane. the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big indian attack.scenes like that are extremely well done.if you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western.look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big horn.this part got him at least noticed in hollywood.

the plainsman is an entertaining western, no doubt a classic, which is actual even today. gary cooper is wild bill hickok, ideal for the role, together with john wayne and james stewart, they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation. jean arthur is great as calamity jane, nobody that i know played it better than her. even if might not be historically accurate, the film manages to capture the most important about hickok and about the time it takes place. sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what demille does here. the friendship of hickok with buffalo bill, the selling of rifles to the indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war, custer and little big horn, the uneasy relationship between buffalo bill's wife, a religious woman, with hickok a man who had killed plenty, also the unusual love affair between hickok and calamity all this makes 'the plainsman' a non conventional and interesting film. anthony quinn has a very short appearance, that already shows what a great actor he was going to become. a lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time.

this movie has wild bill hickok, calamity jane, buffalo bill and general custer all together. gary cooper plays wild bill and jean arthur plays calamity jane and charles bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to the indians and you can hardly recognize him. this was the first time cecil b. demille and gary cooper worked together and the next movie the made was basically the same but set in a different time. this movie starts out with lincoln's assassination and it also deals with an indian war. calamity jane is in love with wild bill and buffalo bill has gotten married and now wants to stay home. this movie also deals with custer's last stand and is far from accurate. gary cooper is good as usual and i usually don't like jean arthur but i liked her here.

this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level.however if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcock,cody and calamity jane then look elsewhere, as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend.the story moves with a cracking pace, and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie.the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout, also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior, he actually married one of demilles daughters in real life.indeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back, the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american history.so please take time out to watch this classic western.

this cecil b. demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting calamity jane. she really pulled it off! gary cooper is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'the plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james. even abraham lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, demille would have us believe so). there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. it isn't just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of washington. but let's not get into politics, let's leave that to demille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'bad boy of music'. antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. that is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian. gabby hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. gary cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?

this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock. he, buffalo bill cody, and calamity jane, are the central characters.as the civil war closes, lincoln mentions his concern that the country's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice, "go west, young man," which, mercifully, the film didn't erroneously attribute to horace greeley, as a number of others did. but then, he gets assassinated, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians.in the meantime, we see wild bill hickock, who interacts with a small boy, while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi. wild bill uses a bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an "arkansas toothpick," which in reality was a different type of knife, though both were used throughout the frontier.hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody, who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man. cody has just gotten married, and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down.when they arrive at their destination, they run into calamity jane, who has a crush on hickock. she looks at cody's wife, and asks buffalo bill, "is this your mopsy?" the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem, since one definition of "mopsy" was prostitute. demille wanted the line in, and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter's books about peter rabbit, three of the rabbits were flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail. he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify "the rabbit of ill virtue." it worked; the line stayed in.the indians were getting restless, in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers. cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area, so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area. cody led the troops; hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief, who was an old acquaintance, and who was leading some of the hostile indians.calamity jane gets captured, and hickock gets captured trying to save her. they are brought to the chief, and although neither would talk, torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane's willpower, and she tells the route cody is using.the two are released, and hickock joins up with cody and his forces, in part to alert them they're walking into a trap. with hickok's help, they hold off the indian attack.hickock decides to go after the gun runners, and finally takes them prisoner. as they're waiting for authorities, hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards.there are numerous historic anomalies in the film, but it retains the flavor of legend. pretty good for the 1930s.

after the failure of "the crusades" at the box office, cecil b. demille stopped doing films about non-american history. his films for the next thirteen years were about our history from jean lafitte to world war ii (dr. wassell). the first in order of production was this film, starring gary cooper as wild bill hickok, with jean arthur as calamity jane. james ellison was buffalo bill, john miljan (not a villain as usual) was general george a. custer, and anthony quinn was one of the indians who fought at little big horn. the villains were led by charles bickford (selling arms to the indians) and porter hall as jack mccall (who killed wild bill hickok).basically the film takes up the history of the u.s. after the civil war. lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that lee has surrendered. lincoln talks about the need to secure the west (more about this point later). then he announces he has to go to the theater. that april 14th must have been very busy for abe - in "virginia city" he grants a pardon to errol flynn at the request of miriam hopkins on the same date.actually, while lincoln was concerned about the west, his immediate thoughts on the last day of his presidency were about reunifying the former confederate states and it's citizens into the union as soon as possible. it was reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of maximillian and his french controlled forces in mexico against juarez). but he had been involved in actual problems with the west. in 1862 he sent disgraced general john pope, the loser at second manassas, to minnesota to put down a serious indian war by the sioux (the subject of mckinley kantor's novel, "sprit lake". pope, incompetent against lee and jackson, turned out to be quite effective here, and the revolt was smashed.however, with all lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as cooper repeats at least once), "the frontier should be secure." there is nothing to say he could not have said it, but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman. like saying, teddy roosevelt said, "eat a good breakfast every morning for your health." it is not a profound statement of policy. it is, at best, a statement of recognizable fact. cooper turning it into a minor mantra, like lincoln's version of the monroe doctrine, is ridiculous...typical of the way demille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them.however, this is not a ruinous mistake. "the plainsman" is an adventure film, and as such it has the full benefit of demille the film creator of spectacle. as such it is well worth watching. but not as a textbook on lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy.

"the plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. the audio is mono but nicely balanced.extras: forget it. it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!

on the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. beneath the veneer, it is mgm character actor stunt-casting at its funniest.the leads are straightforward, but all the secondaries are cast much against type. margaret hamilton (aka wicked witch of the west), edward everett horton (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and sig ruman (the marx brothers' nemesis in _night in casablanca_ and the always-wonderful _night at the opera_), playing a well-intentioned gang trying to bring the two leads together, instead of driving them apart as their "usual" characters would do.it also pokes fun at many romantic-comedy conventions, which is another indication that this could be not so much a "straight" romantic comedy, as it is a wry send-up of the many post-war romantic comedies & their 2-dimensional, stock characters.i've seen it only once, with interruptions, so i can't be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked better in the context of the time at which it was made, but is less successful now that viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. i'm assuming this is the case when i give it 9 stars. i thought it was hysterical.

my observations: postwar hilarity. tom drake and grandpa from "meet me in st. louis" two years later (the year i was born). donna reed charming and pretty. margaret hamilton good as always; smaller part than in "wizard of oz". spring byington way prettier, also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton. tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious. as a two year veteran of army tents, he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes.i used to work in a department store, and it was just as elegant as this one. sadly, it has disappeared and faded into obscurity. we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store, to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise.10/10

the arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy. donna reed and tom drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. both are extremely likable and attractive.the supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of sig ruman's annoying faux russian.

i loved this movie!!! the characters were people that you could feel for. the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life. the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well. the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. the most touching scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. i laughed in parts, cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. in fact i've re-watched it about 5 times. a definite must see for total romantics.

if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should. that's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes. unlike marilyn monroe in that film, jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means.and it's men of means that jean harlow is after. she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it. her talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty.her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone. but unbeknownst to jean, stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns. still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices. lionel's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son, franchot tone. after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree.the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship. i've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film. still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated. what a great comic talent that woman had, seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later.ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde, thelma todd. harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma. todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given. don't miss the girl from missouri, it's bright and sassy, must be from all that sparkling jewelry.

in this film, made just as the production code was being enforced, jean harlow is eadie, and patsy kelly is the wisecracking, man-chasing sidekick "kitty". girl from missouri starts out with the girls getting on a train, with eadie making a promise to herself to earn money while looking for a millionaire husband, staying whole-some in the process. it doesn't take her long to meet up with frank cousins, (lewis stone, was the kindly doctor in grand hotel, as well as judge hardy in the "andy hardy" films.), but all is not as it seems...the censors must have loved harlow's line "a girl couldn't accept an expensive gift like that from a gentleman unless she was engaged." later, someone says "you know we've never been alone together" and eadie replies "yeah, and we're not going to be!" lionel barrymore is t.r. paige, another rich, uppercrust who comes to her rescue when trouble comes looking for eadie. at one point, paige declares "you oughta scratch me off your list - i'm not a ladies man".... i wonder what that line would have been just a couple years earlier before the hayes code came rolling into town. what was he really saying? carol tevis seems to be the high-pitched "baby talker" as listed in the credits on imdb. looks like she was only in showbiz from 1931 - 1939, with "munchkin" in wizard of oz being the last part she played. fun, cleancut romp as the girls chase men around the country. look for nat pendleton as the lifeguard, who was an olympic wrestler 1920 (silver medal winner) turned film star (he was in many of the dr. kildares, and would appear in four of harlow's films.) mistaken identity, plot twists, a young franchot tone, love stories, even jean harlow in a bathing suit in "palm beach", although the outdoor scenes of downtown appear to be a backdrop.

the girl from missouri arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants: to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. with her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love?jean harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. with her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments, she is a dazzler. but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress. she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood pantheon.an excellent cast gives harlow fine support: lionel barrymore as the wily old tycoon, wise to harlow's ways; handsome franchot tone as his son, smitten with love; raucous patsy kelly, stealing her scenes as harlow's sidekick; debonair alan mowbray, as a well-mannered english lord; elderly clara blandick as barrymore's feisty secretary; hearty hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; muscular nat pendleton as a lifeguard who catches kelly's flirtatious eye; and lewis stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman.it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood's production code was instituted. a comparison with red-headed woman, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which harlow's character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.

rain or shine outside, you enter a movie house. it makes you happy. (if not, come right out.) lights go off. you settle down with a bar of ice cream. moving pictures begin to flicker on the screen. you feel content. in the dark, you are back in the beginning of time. sitting around the campfire...looking at the modern version of the flickering flames 24 times per second and sharing the joy of discovering the unknown turns and twists of the scenario with rest of your clan/spectators.those who are not happy with themselves, should not write comments. (long live romantic comedies...)

i have to be 100% honest with you fellow imdb users. i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. doesn't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way? i'm in love with that woman! i got what i expected...but only half. this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.while i don't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated; i must admit that "préte-moi ta main" has plenty of flaws.my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters. there isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment "of romance" or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other.in fact, the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward (when both are in the couch) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest. i didn't buy the dinner sequence.still, the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise. i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days.i understand it's a movie and that's why i accept it as a funny situation. plus, the humor is versatile. there are moments involving s&m, funny lines with chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations involving the family women, and more.charlotte gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie. she's funny, sexy, looks very thin and fine, and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance.alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. i think the supporting cast do what they can.the score, art direction, and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film.those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits. it's a good example of feel good cinema.

i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. i can't understand why some people say she's not. boring....??? maybe the one who said she's boring is because he/she is boring. she's a great actress and the movie was excellent. it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers. the direction was great. i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. when she goes to the sister's shop is simply amazing. everything's great. we have a very good actress, wonderful, for long time. alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect. i like him more than in his next movie la science des rêves. and eric lartigau did a very good work.ana

from the opening shots of the lead actor, we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them, and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of 'normal' life.eric lartigau, the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives, yet without the help/support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work. the use of facial image throughout the film is superb, and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family (mother) is spot on.while there are more than enough laughs in the movie, it still deals with single parents/adoption and the strength of family in society. truly rewarding to watch, and again one that only the french seam capable to make.so far one of the best 50 or so films i have seen this year, and well worth a five start rating. i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages.

didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the "no expectation" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated.the setting was interesting, strange but interesting. the storyline had gaps/jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit. there's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the "romantic" ambiance. but they all didn't matter.the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite. there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist; i fell in love with it and here i am, writing this review. the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and i believe, that is the core of this movie.this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first. i cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but i hope you do.

alain chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'. but, like i said, chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to. i'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to charlotte gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance. if you absolutely insist on knowing, the 'plot' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single. this doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend, allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him, thus getting him off the hook. naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub-benedek and beatrice duelling and all things considered it's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question.

there wasn't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after i left the cinema, having seen this gem of a film in a sold-out house as part of this year's hamburg film festival. and the tears shed were all of laughter. this film was hilarious, there's no other way of saying this. there wasn't one boring bit in it, i laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of french cinéma.alain chabat was absolutely terrific. a great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it. the performance was of course completely over the top, but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well. equally great was charlotte gainsbourg who i love to see a lot, and the mother was also a very strong performance. the sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script-wise, but apart from that there is nothing to moan about. i had a great afternoon seeing this film while hamburg was drowning in rain outside, and i wish films like this from france would get a regular release in germany. but the distributors is this country don't seem to understand that the french make good films. i at least can't wait to find a dvd which offers subtitles (hello australia? please?) because that film i need at home to watch several more times!

alain chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old, if not older, than shakespeare.chabat is a "vieux garcon", happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. he has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - the g7 - who decide he should be married. enter the delightful, charming charlotte gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan. charlotte has to pose as chabat's girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding. no more talk of marriage from the g7. of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of control.there are very strong supporting roles from lafont as the mother and osterman as the tight-fisted brother of gainsbourg.there are some fantastic scenes as first charlotte has to charm, then revolt the family. french farce with an english.

in this grim melodrama, barbara stanwyck plays the eldest of three wealthy sisters who become orphans when their father dies in france. threatened with the danger of losing the opulent family home, big sister makes a grand sacrifice and secretly marries a real estate developer so she can inherit her... aunt's fortune. a few years later, she learns that he is after the family estate and wants to tear it down so she leaves him and tries to stop him. more time passes and the husband ends up taking her to court when he learns that she has borne him a son without telling him. the part of "gig young" was played by actor byron barr who later assumed the name before he became famous.anyone interested in purchasing a copy let me know by writing to me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com

this was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40's - warner bros. at the very height of their style. the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing. max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method. the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "now, voyager" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred bette davis. in my opinion, "the gay sisters" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. if you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!

three girls, the youngest descendents of the gaylord family, one of america's most royal families, are orphaned at a young age. right before he goes off to france to fight in wwi, their father tells the oldest, fiona, never to sell the land. by the time the sisters have become adults, they have had to squander most of their money to pay for lawyers to defend their property. through certain loopholes in the father's will, a man named charles barclay stands to gain possession of the gaylord land, on which he wants to build a complex called barclay circle. barclay is actually based on john d. rockefeller, who was buying up land and buildings from affluent families in new york so he could build rockefeller center.this film deals mostly with the melodramatic concerns of the three sisters. fiona, well played by barbara stanwyck, although it's certainly not to be counted as one of her best roles, seems like a cold, domineering woman, and it becomes clear that she has some skeletons in her closet. susanna, played by nancy coleman, is a little ditsy and completely in love with a young modern artist named gig young. coleman's was my favorite performance in the film. evelyn, played by geraldine fitzgerald, is a rather pretentious seductress with a monocle who married into noble blood in england, but that doesn't stop her from trying to steal gig from her sister. the three sisters are developed quite well but, as is the major trend in the gay sisters, never well enough. charles barclay is played by george brent. he isn't very good. well, he would be satisfactory if the story had played out the way it should have, but he always seems like a scumbag in the film. when we're asked to sympathize with him late in the film, it's impossible. gig young is played by, huh?, gig young. no, he's not playing himself. what happened is that the actor, who had acted in several movies previously under his real name, byron barr, was pressured by warner brothers to change his name to something more catchy. i'm not sure who made the final choice, but he eventually changed his screen name to gig young, after the character whom he plays in the gay sisters. weird, eh? young is quite good through most of the film, but the script does some unfortunate things with his character late in the film which ultimately harm the audience's sympathy for him. in two other supporting roles, helen thimig and gene lockhart are quite good.the gay sisters had great potential to turn out to be one of the great cinematic family sagas. the characters are all interesting, as are their situations. unfortunately, the script never strives for anything more than the simplest melodrama. if it had made the interrelationships of all the major characters more complex, fleshed out, for example, the rivalry between evelyn and susanna or made the flashback more intricate, the film could have been fantastic. it also could have fleshed out the prologue more, let us know more about the gaylord family. we need to care more about the characters and we need to sympathize with them more. and the ending needed some major fixing. it basically just gives up at the end. fiona's problems are solved so poorly that it hurts. whatever sympathy her character had gained as the film progressed falls apart. it's also far too happy. this story seems moving towards tragedy, or maybe just a sense of historical significance or loss. and we still hate barclay. and the conflict between the two sisters and gig is never solved. as bad as fiona's story ends, susanna's, gig's, and evelyn's is even worse.i still liked the film. it's thoroughly watchable, even if it doesn't involve us like other great films of the era. 7/10, mostly for its potential. it should have been remade, or the novel should have been re-adapted, at some point during the studio era. it is too dated to be remade now. the 1950s would have been the best time, during the time of films like giant.

it's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie...played by gig young. but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name.i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film, mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona. she was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring, and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania, and whose father was later killed during woar war i. as the "man" of the house, fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home. but fiona's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much. geraldine fitzgerald is the middle, flirty sister, who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister's boyfriend (gig young).if you're a stanwyck fan, this is a no miss.

in the process of trying to establish the audiences' empathy with jake roedel (tobey maguire) the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers. missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force. the southerners fought for state's rights: the right to own slaves, elect crooked legislatures and judges, and employ a political spoils system. there's nothing noble in that. the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate army.it seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. when jake leaves the bushwhackers, it's not because he saw error in his way, he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition.

you're waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. i rated the audie murphy movie a 3 (i'm a harsh grader), the second lowest i ever gave audie (the worst being "battle at bloody beach" if you're curious). i give this movie a rating of "8" (and i'm a harsh grader) it's the civil war story of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them that, against the north. people like quantrell, and the men who rode with these outlaws.the original was a watery version, very clean cut, while still depicting the horror of what these men did. actually, movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discern the story. i would be more apt to rate the original "r" and this one, with it's gruff nature, a gp, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version.film makers since the early sixties have boasted about "realism", but few of them deliver. instead, they just give the drab scenery, drab costumes, and drab events, but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era.modern film makers have realized this mistake. it is evident in a superior style of western we usually see today. this movie is an example. it gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.it has a few lulls, which makes a complete sit through a bit hard, and it has some unexplained situations. but unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up, and the characters are intriguing enough.it begins a bit campy, but really improves. the main character is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. the audie murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy, and is too self righteous without motivation.the character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. there is motivation, and a method to his madness. we never feel he is truly "right", but we can understand where he comes from.there is plenty of action in the movie. there is also some humor. one good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him, and he mulls that over.this movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades. this director and writer team got it right.recommended. complete success.

i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake. he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen. and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before. the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all. i did not know what to expect from jewel's performance but i think she did rather well. lots of exciting scenes. a thoroughly good ride. i am absolutely a fan of maguire's. check out cider house rules. one of the all time best ever.

ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film, to catch action, characters and setting on the hoof, as they emerge. covering the haphazard endgame of the american civil war via the haphazard actions of a young militia, unformed in mind or manhood, this is an ideal approach. the film turns out to be about the formation of personalities, adulthood and relationships. lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent character, enduring the strife like a hardy parent.james schamus' script is probably the standard bearer for this film; close behind it are a number of well-appointed performances that carry it admirably. jeffrey wright's name alone could carry this film for me. he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role: instead we are treated to very good (if not revelatory) performances from a large, often recognisable ensemble.a noble, optimistic film. one to watch if you don't fancy the harder, more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim, for example. 7/10

so, neighbor was killing neighbor. reminds me of iraq. as i watched the american flag (50 stars in 1864?) being dragged behind the horse, i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of rights. i'm a southerner, and must have some historical memory.watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. many twists in this movie. the wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles'.the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the copeland horse-thieving gang, inc. in mississippi, was hung about that time. bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. remind you of iraq? and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today.too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. that's mesopotamia, now called iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. the wild-eyed killers in missouri, raiding lawrence, kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.another anomaly was the father's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school "even before they erect a church. and for that reason, they'll win." huh????? i was taught history in birmingham, al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won. course, they also literally had god on their side. as you see here, when the freed slave indicates that he's cutting out to free his mother, sold into slavery in texas. god, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in alabama). you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. they have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. just more mindless slaughter.you're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. so much suffering for such a stupid cause.the cinematography is fantastic. now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew history. the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. you see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. you see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq, i'm thinking, "where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?" i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it. with good reason. tobey at his best, pre-spideyman. buy the dvd or rent it. and tell me why others laud this, not just liberals cest moi.

one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., tobey maguire (before spiderman), skeet ulrich (before jericho), jonathan rhys meyers (before tudors), james caviezel, simon baker, mark ruffalo, jeffrey wright, tom wilkinson, and jewel. all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.when the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. however, it is seldom every seen on cable. i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.

i really enjoyed the detail that went into the script.jonathan rhys myers (misspelled) and jewel were outstanding in their support roles. as was jeffery wright. toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, knowing he would die without the procedure. attention to detail, with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly well.why this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine. i have strong suspicions. which makes it all the more appealing to me. i have given a dozen dvd copies out for presents.completely overlooked movie. rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours, then judge.

an unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. tobey maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. the script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. that said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a tv mini-series. still, frederick elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch). worth seeing.

when i heard this film was directed by ang lee, i made sure to see it. this taiwanese director burst into fame with "the wedding banquet" and "eat drink man woman" a few years ago and then moved on to "sense and sensibility" and "the ice storm". now, he turns his attention to another american icon -- the civil war.this story takes place in missouri, a union state with southern sympathies. these never officially joined the confederate army. instead, they formed outlaw bands, called "bushwhackers", grew they hair long, and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.the movie depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union. there are no stars in this movie, unless you consider "jewel" the singer, well cast as a young confederate widow as a star.tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers. this young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war.jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom. he gives a fine and understated performance.some of the acting, however, is wooden, especially in the long conversations they have about morality. and their costumes are too new. and the "southern gentleman" theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms, then burn down the stores and houses.while i don't think that this will go down as one of lee ang's "great" movies, i did find myself fascinated by it, in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes. i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history.not as much action as the usual war movie, but yet still recommended -- especially for civil war buffs.

the most succinct way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word: authenticity. i will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film, but i would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film, i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding "bleeding kansas". yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. but the overall feel of the film is genuine. authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no pc hindsight here) even the actors look authentic.even jewel kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.a few viewers i talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog. they cannot believe that 19th century farmers would "talk like poets".what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness, the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible. the screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from documentation of the time. the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.but in addition to a historical document, this film works on a visceral level as well. beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. the raid on lawrence, kansas, done so many times before in so many other, lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.this film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want. in a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like american beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years. please rent this film. you will not be disappointed.

the star of this film is the screenplay. attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we don't hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. it is a reminder of kosovo to-day. the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. a great film....

ride with the devil directed by ang lee(crouching tiger) is another gem in this fine directors cap. for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war. see this film & you will visit a sad piece of americana. besides some superb action scenes (quite bloody at times). this is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular. it stars toby maguire, skeet ulrich jeffrey wright & as the young lady jewel, i never heard or seen her before, i want to see more of her).the acting is top notch, superb production values, very well written (adapted from a novel) this is a long film 128 minutes, but well worth seeing. my rating is **** respectively submittedjay harris

after seeing all the jesse james, quantrill, jayhawkers,etc films in the fifties, it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee. the scene of the attack of lawrence, kansas is awesome. the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys-meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war, and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours. definitely worth seeing.

ride with the devil, like ang lee's later brokeback mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended. a perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. i really don't recall another war film, will so capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your belief in humanity. after seeing so many killings, so many sufferings , you don't feel yourself numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. the actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. some shoots, are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the seeing of soul. such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.a film like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, everything it says by itself. ovation to the cast which includes tobey maguire, jeffrey wright and jewel kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!

ride with the devil has something rich and special, if you can stand the slow development. while tackling a dark, gritty subject, the brutal guerrilla war in the american west during its civil war (which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s), the movie maintains a strangely satisfying, unmanipulated atmosphere. what i'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel. but rwtd instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack, and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses.as an enthusast of this particular area of cw history, i'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film. the diologue is expertly written, (even with subtle humor occasionally) with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles (independence for example...a far cry from the oregon trail!). the minor events that occur to jake's band are similar to actual events that took place...especially the attack when they're holed up in the house, and the destruction of the store/booth. the battle scenes, though rare, are pretty well executed. it even has the first cw cavalry battle put on film recently.the directing shows the talent everyone expects of ang lee in subtle ways. example: the character of black john is shown taunting a lawrence resident during the massacre: "where's your army? who are we to fight!? who are we to fight?! (the shot then switches to a trio of confederate regulars standing, doing nothing to stop the carnage while the voice continues) you are cowards all!" who are the cowards, really? little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality.there are no major glaring areas in the history, something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film glory, which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows. some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up. but you will never notice that. a larger curiosity is the fact that the only african-american man-at-arms character in the film is the quasi-slave fighting for jake and his confederate bushwhackers. it is true that some blacks did fight for the confederacy out there, including one who scouted lawrence for quantrill before the attack (who would suspect him?). though this black rebel is a fasinating character (whatever pc african-americans might think of him), not a single black union infantryman is seen in the film, which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the western cw. one of the first black regiments of the cw was raised in kansas (by the murderer senator jim lane, and before the 54th mass. reg. of fame was organized), and black troops in such battles as baxter springs, ks, played a critical role.no glaring historical errors. good, realistic action, which is infrequent and not gratitous. good directing. this film may not be the blockbusters other recent civil war were, but it's the cleanest job of any.

the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed, and in all probability never will. and, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving. it is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective, which is what director ang lee provides in `ride with the devil,' a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the war itself, and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the war, the infamous raid on lawrence, kansas, by quantrill and his raiders, which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the confederate point-of-view.in 1863, the union influence predominates in the state of kansas, and even across the border in neighboring missouri, those with confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching northerners, especially without the aid of what could be considered any `regular' confederate troops. and when things begin to really heat up around their own town, jack bull chiles (skeet ulrich) and jake roedel (tobey maguire) form a band of their own and join in the fray, doing damage to the union cause wherever it is practicable. jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right. there are others, however, even among their own, men like the young pitt mackeson (jonathan rhys-meyers), who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality, perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims. and so, for jack bull and jake, as well as many just like them, it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood. and they will have to ride with the very devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds.as with all of his films, director ang lee approaches his story through an incisive, yet subtle examination of the traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting. and in so doing, lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers, perhaps, a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged. whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters (`eat drink man woman'), the effects of class distinction (`sense and sensibility'), the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies (`crouching tiger, hidden dragon') or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above (`the ice storm'), lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level. this film is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography (in this film, by frederick elmes, who also did `the ice storm' brilliantly), which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry. it's that special lee touch, and it adds a wistful, reflective sense to whatever story he is telling, which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.as jake, tobey maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops, and his character along with it. most importantly, maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him, which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation: his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those `murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere, even in such troubled times; the betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly. it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance, and it is no small accomplishment. it is, however, the kind of studied, understated performance that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; work like this is worthy of acclaim, and should be recognized.skeet ulrich is effective, as well, as jack bull, and jewel (in her motion picture debut) turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley. it is jeffrey wright, however, who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt, as well as jonathan rhys-meyers, who brings a chilling christopher walken-like menace to his role of pitt. also, in what amounts to a cameo role (one scene), mark ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.the supporting cast includes james caviezel (black john), simon baker (george clyde), tom guiry (riley), tom wilkinson (orton brown), john ales (quantrill), john judd (otto roedel) and kathleen warfel (mrs. chiles). the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like ang lee and films like `ride with the devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing. in light of more recent events, it is something that is sorely needed, worldwide. film is a powerful medium; it can be educational as well as entertaining, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, like ang lee, will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are. 8/10.   

strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark, so i had to wait for the video release. my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed. as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting, an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming. along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90`s.people who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the patriot(corny) or braveheart(acceptable) will be sourly disappointed, all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it. 9 out of 10.

for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate, (which basically satanised the english), it was interesting to see this film. by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in, and they were the only nationality present. it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours. all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict, and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts, often culminating in the suffering of the innocent. this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all.

taiwanese director ang lee, whose previous films include 'sense and sensibility' and 'the ice storm', turned to the american civil war for his latest feature. based on a novel by daniel woodrell, it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas, known as bushwhackers, as they fight their northern equivalents, the jayhawkers in the backwater of missouri.as one might expect, there is plenty of visceral action, but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family. jake roedel (tobey maguire) is such a man, or rather, boy, as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri. he is the son of a german immigrant, but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist, he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles (skeet ulrich) and rides with the bushwhackers. despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men, he remains loyal to the cause. so does his friend daniel holt (jeffrey wright), a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the south.lee handles the subject with aplomb, never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting. the action is unglamorised and admirably candid, recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.the performances are superb, with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified. up-and-coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant. lee never flinches from the reality of war, but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship, the demonstration of courage and, on a wider scale, the emancipation of oppressed peoples. ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience.

this movie is one of the sleepers of all time. i gave it a 10 rating. the story is of the famed 'bushwhackers' out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states. the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for hollywood. the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. i suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. not just one or two... this movie really jelled! it has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. even has the future spiderman and jewel. and she's good!

in anticipation of ang lee's new movie "crouching tiger, hidden dragon," i saw this at blockbuster and figured i'd give it a try. a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch. luckily though, i had a good feeling about this director. this movie was wonderfully written. the dialogue is in the old southern style, yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated. the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie. toby maguire was awesome. i thought he was good (but nothing special) in pleasantville, but here he shines. i have always thought of skeet ulrich as a good actor (but nothing special), but here he is excellent as well. the big shocker for me was jewel. she was amazingly good. jeffrey wright, who i had never heard of before, is also excellent in this movie. it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand. a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. this movie had the perfect combination. the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular. this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others. it lets you really get to know the characters, which are all very dynamic and interesting. the plot is complex, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing, and ready for anything at any time. literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were "too quiet" (brilliant directing). this was also a beautifully shot movie. the scenery was not breath taking (it's in missouri and kansas for goodness sakez) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. has that rough and rugged feel, but keeps an elegance, which is very pleasant on the eyes. the movie was deep. it told a story and in doing so made you think. it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story. specifically, it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie, too many to pick out. it was like a beautifully written short story, filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. if you like great acting, writing, lots of action, and some of the best directing ever, see this movie! take a chance on it.

easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire. but don't watch this movie expecting to be "entertained." ang lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the civil war. what is beautiful about the movie, like all of lee's films, is that he doesn't "side" with his characters. he creates characters, embodies them with life, problems, and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. this film has action, but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters, it is real. and as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars, the violence is horrific.but as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the civil war, it is a masterpiece. was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the blue and the grey. neither is about idealism, though, as seen in gone with the wind. it is about freedom, about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. as you watch the characters, you will ask yourself "how can they be fighting to preserve slavery?" the fact is, i don't think they really are, and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the civil war.the fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to "home" though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values. the letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. jake and daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. and when the tension finally snaps, and these characters find themselves suddenly "free" ... we see the birth of new men.all this mixed in with lee's beautiful incorporation of humankind's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames. lee has a style which is his, somehow european in its "art" (a slow camera, unrushed), asian in its epic-ness and development of story, and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in north americans.relax, let go of your preconceptions about what the civil war is, what the "western" as a genre is, what a war movie should be ... and let ang lee take you into a world so fragile, so hard, so real that few of us can comfortably see it.in this, lee continues what he wrought in ice storm. again, the movie is slow paced and without apparent "direction" ... a sure sign of lee's ability to direct without "imposing" himself on the story or screen. his direction is amplified by what he brings out of jewel (yes, the singer), a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.a movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard hollywood epic.

i've watched this movie twice now on dvd, and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. it seems more like a depiction of reality than most other hollywood fare, especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint, it doesn't fail to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not matter what, and cruelty is a common denominator.what really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize. nowadays truly good movies (in a nutshell) are few and far apart, with mainstream fare being enjoyable (if you don't have high expectations), but terribly commercially spirited. i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie (without being a masterpiece), because it sticks to itself, and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it, instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. this movie is cool, observant, and generally light-handed in its judgement, which is good.the story has its flaws, especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully, but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic, that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life, even by liberally taking each next guy. still she doesn't come off as weak, in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters, she's always in control of the relationships, with the men just tagging. and i take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow. i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so the prospect of of someone dying, while surely causing grief, didn't traumatise people like it does now. people didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now, and i like that attitude.my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie, if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. don't watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion.

the story: on the island texel, photographer bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious kathleen. her free spirit and lust for life intrigues bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. her life is not so simple as it seems, however. through kathleen, bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. will kathleen be able to win his trust?review: the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's 'psychology' would have been worked out a little more. why do these people do the things they do? what motivates their choices? this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. the story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. so you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level. the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and 'believable' way, but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character's naiveness doesn't quite work for a grown-up woman. camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. i give the movie a 7/10.

this early sirk melodrama, shot in black and white, is a minor film, yet showcases the flair of the german director in enhancing tired story lines into something resembling art. set in the 1910's, barbara stanwyck is the woman who has sinned by abandoning her small-town husband and family for the lure of the chicago stage. she never fulfilled her ambitions, and is drawn back to the town she left by an eager letter from her daughter informing her that she too has taken a liking to the theatre (a high school production, that is). back in her old town she once again comes up against small-mindedness, and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, bewildered (and boring) husband (richard carlson) and ex-lover. the plot is nothing new but sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with every frame carefully shot, and he is aided immeasurably by having stanwyck as his leading lady. it runs a crisp 76 minutes, and that's just as well, because the material doesn't really have the legs to go any further.

yes, i call this a perfect movie. not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. it's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.barbara stanwyck is simply stunning. there was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. no hysterical outbursts with this lady - i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.the title fits this movie very well. it is about desires, human desires i think everyone can understand. actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here.i liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock's shadow of a doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america. the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang's considerably harsher movie clash by night, made one year earlier, where stanywck stars in a similar part. i can also recommend it.

barbara stanwyck gives this early douglas sirk-directed, universal-produced soap just the kick that it needs. not nearly as memorable as sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by watching "all i desire" where sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years. stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown, u.s.a, after deserting them a decade earlier. her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return. some of the cinematography is amazing, and stanwyck is tough-as-nails and really gives this film a shot of energy. overall, a fairly good show.

saw this film yesterday for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. i'm a student of screen writing and i loved the way the minor characters intervened just when something pivotal/climatic happened in a scene. i thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of story is rather shocking - at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend; and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn't seen in ten years; and with the gunshot signal 'two shots and then one' she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch (the reason she left town in the first place!) all at the same time! the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50's.love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue - just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doing the 'bunny hug' is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd.one of the best films from that period i've seen in a long time.

i saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix (convenient service by the way). all in all, i liked this lighthearted, sometimes genre challenged, mini series. the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine. yes, it does have some romance clichés of running in the rain or a train station goodbye, but the characters have a chance to be explored so it doesn't seem cheesy, like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar. robson greene, who at times reminds me of a separated-at-birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare. personally, i think the series could have been done with two episodes, but that's up for debate i suppose. apparently, there's a sequel, and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix.

francesca annis, michael kitchen and robson green!! wow, what a trio...ok, so this is no anna karenina, but it is a good love story, very well-written and well-acted by all. even a few 'laugh-out-loud' moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity, age bias, and parental aging/alzheimer's issues.quirky guitar music added to the story as well.while i have been a fan of ms. annis' since 'lillie' (in the '70s) and mr. kitchen's since 'the buccaneers' and 'enchanted april', i have only recently discovered mr. green ('me and mrs. jones', 'touching evil', etc.), making me ask the question - why had i not seen 'reckless' until recently??!! admittedly more of a 'chick flick' than something a man will sit through, it is perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy viewing.

this gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on dvd years after its pbs broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. my only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger manchester accents are difficult at times. luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. robson green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. francesca annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (the love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. the mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. as russell baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "reckless" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (the sequel, a part of the dvd box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. you won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)

hunky geordie robson green is owen springer, a young doctor who moves home to manchester to be near his father. along the way, he falls for anna, a woman 20 years his senior, and who happens to be the wife of his new boss, richard crane. despite warnings from his new colleagues, owen proceeds to get anna for himself, going as far as to sabotage anna and the cheating richard's marriage. this is a romantic drama with many humorous undertones and a quick wit. the actors are superb: green of "the student prince" and "touching evil" smolders on-screen as the cunning, yet warm-hearted owen; annis of "dune" fame is lively and proves a good match to green; kitchen, from "to play the king" is the right menace as richard, whose comic missteps and snobbery underline his masterful, building hatred for owen. this is a perfect love triangle, and despite the foibles and fallacies of our three characters, you come away better for knowing and watching them.

this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch. the supporting cast could form a series of their own. it's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. only the superior acting skills of francesca annis, michael kitchen, and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable "romp". the only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a british sex symbol. you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire, with apologies to the "doors". the guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is owen's father david bradley. watch him in "the way we live now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. daniela nardini as kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. conor mullen, and julian rhind-tutt, as green's sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series. they are that good. the whole thing is a great deal of fun, and i heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.

the title of this film is taken from a party game called "seven minutes in heaven." the game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in brooklyn, ny, and he describes it as something like "spin-the-bottle," "lifesaver relay," and other preteen kissing games. according to the rules, a boy's name and a girl's would be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes. in the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands, embrace, and/or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. at the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say, "time's up" or knock on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. after being quizzed by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their "seven minutes in heaven." then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. the couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game.such games have served as social "ice-breakers" for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals. the film has been given this title because it deals with the teens' first experiences with crushes and romantic love.

i've been a jennifer connelly fan since phenomena, and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven, i saw it as soon as i could. the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie!!!!

i really enjoyed this movie.i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate. this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age..who knew that we would bounce back....again and again....great movie!!!!

first off, i'm a huge fan of 80s movies, and of jennifer conelly as well. so yesterday, i wandered into a local used book/movie store and found a vhs copy. i read the back and it sounded good and for $3.99, it was a good deal. so i took it home and popped it in the vcr. what a sweet movie! at my age now, i relate more to movies like about last night or st. elmo's fire, but still i remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy, etc. we all have those little crushes when we're younger. and if it doesn't work out, we're heartbroken and we think that we'll never get over it. but of course we do. many times. it's that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie. the feeling of "oooh! i remember when something like that happened to me..." is all through it. the characters are interesting and well-developed. i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies, teen films in particular, or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.

"the luzhin defence" is, in the foreground, a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (turturro) who becomes consumed by the game and, in the background via flashbacks, his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become. factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest (watson) and former "mentor" (wilson) respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of italy's lake como and the intensity of high chess play. an excellent film for those into period dramas, the auteur's euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film.

this movie rocks" jen sexy as ever and polly wow were we really ever that young this movie can still touch the hearts of a lot of teens it needs to be put on dvd soon or it will become a classic. i really enjoyed growing up to this movie i have always had a crush on jen now i am too old but to this movie is made for all gens> you know i come from the early 80,s area were i had to watch everyone els live the life i wanted but thru movies i can do that all over again i guess in short i am hoping and wishing that this movie not be lost in time but reborn to the youth so they may enjoy the heart warm filling you get learning about hormones and datting problems and how to get away with stuff that seems so major back then but don't mean nothan now so this movie is a dating tool.

considering all the teen films like "the breakfast club" and "pretty in pink" that are lionized. it is surprising that this one is so ignored.there is no sex in it, but sex is thought of, including the idea that it may matter what others think about it. the kids do not always get along with their parents, but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong, and the parents are not seen as monsters.it deals with hero-worship. how one girl does a dangerous thing, which could have lead to real dustier, before realizing that she was wrong.the movie is kind of ahead of its' time. one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses. she says she is doing nothing to need birth control. she replies (wrongly) "oral sex".

i originally came across linda feferman's seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it. i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure. the movie stars jennifer connelly, almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind, as natalie becker. byron thames plays her best friend in the world, jeff moran. the film is definitely a milder, cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink's and some kind of wonderful's of the 1980's, which is exactly why it is so good. it's honest, not forced like those films, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids.when natalie's dad leave home on a business trip, jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks. with support from natalie's friend, polly, played exquisitely by maddie corman, she lets him. but this movie isn't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with. the three leads are so natural and the script, surprisingly so honest, that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking. these characters really do care about each other. it's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre-teen adolescence.

despite its rather salacious title, this is a light teen dramedy. unless you're an old coot, you'll probably find it likeable. it isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly, though. when you view it, you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time. this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters, and they are appealing enough. jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many, i know, but i've always liked the more obscure maddie corman. the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown-ups. is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike?

of course the plot, script, and, especially casting are strong in the film. so many fine things to see. one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist--luzhini's (turturro's)--ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines. his chess opponent--an italian dandy in three piece and cane--turns out to be a real gent, and a truly fine chess player. to his credit the "opponent" nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously (luzhin has taken a flyer out a window--sad, but so releasing to him)by way of the unstable genius' widow (emily watson.) in death, then, because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master, luzhin's defence (which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity) is allowed to be played. the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant. talk about a dramatic "end game!"

this is the second eytan fox film i have seen. the fantastic actor, lior ashkenazi, who starred in walk on water, has a minor role in this film also.but the real stars are the young israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - noam (ohad knoller), lulu (daniela virtzer), and yelli (alon friedman); and the palestinian that joins them off and on - ashraf (yousef 'joe' sweid). there is sort of a friends/sex in the city thing going on (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.but, that's the rub. no matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war is not going to end. many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason. there are many on the israeli side, both there and here in the us, who just want it all and will not consider peace. there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. it is in no one's interest to end this war, and the children suffer.this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film. it won't go away. you know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. with the feelings on both sides running strong, and revenge as the motivator, tragedy always happens, and that is what makes this an adult version of friends/sex in the city. there is no superficiality. it is real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.

movies like this one, and c.r.a.z.y., make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter. with the exception of parting glances and brokeback mountain, there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie, the bubble. this movie centers on two men, noam and ashwar, an israle and palestinian respectively. their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and arabs in israel. couples, in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next, or who will say "i love you" first. noam and ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security check points, and racism. while noam's friends accept and like ashwar, who is arab, it is clear that most of tel aviv's citizens probably don't.one of the most touching moments, and there are many in this film, is when noam and ashwar attend a production of "bent". we, as movie goers, see them watching this play, and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. and ultimately, this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.ohad knoller and youseff 'joe' sweid are outstanding as noam and ashwar. director eytan fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet. and while most movies today have sex in them, (almost as a sport), this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. it is so refreshing. also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. there are cartoonish characters in this movie. it just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and "friends". well, not really. yes, these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships. but i don't recall getting "blowed up" as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in "friends".this is a very good movie. it has heart, and heartbreak. and like all good love stories love does win out. but not in it's intact glory of full bloom . still, it's a very satisfying movie to watch.

directed and co-written by eytan fox the writer/director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature "yossi & jagger" (2002). this comparative epic, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity.while "yossi & jagger" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of israeli military service, "ha buah" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of israel's generally gay-tolerant, but not always gay-friendly, capital tel aviv."ha buah" opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam (ohad knoller  yossi from "yossi & jagger") first meets handsome young arab ashraf (yousef sweid). romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.from there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of ashraf's very conservative family. if you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending.the soundtrack for "ha buah" is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the middle east.the english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best.

here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox. the movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one israeli, one palestinian)in modern tel aviv. the film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. for example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. as we know from yossi & jagger, fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. the film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other. if you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. though the plot is melodramatic, it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be.

this film is a complete re-imagining of romeo and juliet in tel aviv and nablus. the lovers are one from tel aviv et the other from nablus. there is a border between them, and a constant state of war with the israeli army ever present everywhere and the palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs. the situation is bleak enough. we can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap. but the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay, noam from tel aviv and ashraf from nablus. to be gay is accepted in tel aviv. it is off limits in nablus. the conflict between the two peoples, the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures, two ethics. but this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension. ashraf's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in nablus. ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay. she cannot accept it but accepts to speak about it later. from the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into tel aviv to set up a bomb attack. it takes place in a café in tel aviv and one friend of noam's is severely wounded. bad enough. the isareli army sends a commando to nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack, but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street. the funeral follows the wedding. the husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack. ashraf volunteers to take his place. the exiled lover comes back to tel aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister. he arrives at a diner managed by some friends of noam's. but noam sees him and gets out to speak to him. ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when noam reaches him in the street. the vengeance reunites the two lovers in death. we thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the prince of verona, a neutral character that can impose peace, or even worse the prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of israel. the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides. but the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film, a play that shows love in auschwitz, between two prisoners, one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle. this is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking: gay love in auschwitz. what comes out of the film is that over there in tel aviv or nablus love is impossible. the film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in palestine that cannot but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on. we should never have let great britain deal with the region a long time ago. today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated. this will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution. but so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations. so suffering will go on and love will be forbidden, of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on: so let's procreate more and more little soldiers. but love is just an extra-terrestrial concept.dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine & university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne

it's difficult to not have a liking for israeli director eytan fox and for his movies, which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions. besides he also gave voice to the young generations, and to the remarkable part of them, who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people, both in israel both in palestine. these reasons, in my opinion, are sufficient to consider fox a noteworthy director, even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control. however the fans of his movies (that he realized on team with gal uchovsky, his producer, co-screenwriter and also life companion) seem to not being vexed by this, since his new feature, the bubble (ha-buah), is having the same success of the previous yossi & jagger and walk on the water. announced as a contemporary gay version of "romeo & juliet", set in the present day tel aviv instead of verona and with two men (one israeli and the other palestinian) at the place of the two shakespearean young lovers, the film actually is quite different from that or, better, it's also something else. in fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man, noam, played by the fox regular ohad knoller (yossi in yossi & jagger, but i must confess i miss jagger, the astonishing yehuda levi!) and his two co-tenants, a guy and a girl, chose to live. around thirty-years-old, restless, witty and firm (despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the palestine) to live a life that won't be only made of war. the two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other. their lives are destined to change when noam falls in love with ashraf (the tv star yousef 'joe' sweid) a young palestinian who came to live in tel aviv. the laws so far in force among the group are neglected, but not the will to aid one friend. still it won't be easy for noam and his friends, 'cause ashraf is clandestine in israel and in the meantime his family, who lives in palestine and doesn't know he's gay, is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl, who is a relative of ashraf's beloved sister bridegroom-to-be, who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot, with consequences not just for the two men. because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace (interesting dualism, if not automatic) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable. even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between noam and ashraf meets with, it doesn't the overlook the other characters, which turn out well written (for example golan, the boyfriend of yelli, noam's fellow tenant, introduced as a lively boor, and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person) and aptly performed (besides the two leads, we mustn't disregard the funny zohar liba and the lovely daniela virtzer, the girl of the gang; moreover late marriage's star lior ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo). it also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones, even if the director can't do without a melodramatic conclusion. i watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime i often thought about it, proof that fox and his pal have a knack to strike home.

since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love. even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love, love that cannot be. the israeli filmmaker eytan fox' latest film the bubble" is about that. and then it is also not. the title of the film refers to the bubble" that is tel-aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel. the country's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with nablus, a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film. it doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints. actually, it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it. the bubble" of tel-aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any western city. teenage girls looking for britney spears' records, a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue, trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks, while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol. it is this bubble" that also has the potential to lull one's mind into a false sense of reality.the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and, for the most part, try to stay out of politics. yelli, the camp owner and manager of orna & ella", a hip cafe, rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the crap that surrounds them". noam, a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store, seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations. lulu, the only female of the lot, is on the contrary linked to the israeli left, although her political activities seem to be confined to raves against the occupation". yelli and noam naturally don't object to participating in these. lulu and her political friends make t-shirts with the rave's logo, put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood. their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again. the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian-friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets. in other words, predictable products of the bubble".the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty. a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel, among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance. the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam's doorstep in tel-aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border. his name is ashraf, he's palestinian and he's gay. and he hasn't just come to hand back the id, he has come to see noam. without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam's flatmates he stays. he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli's cafe. having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew, he doesn't have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity. the sky is light blue and the air is sweet. but it cannot last. for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be.at one point, noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards. they find a way of being together on another level, a metaphysical one, a level where no one else has access. this is also where our couple arrives in the end. and it couldn't have been much different for them, not in today's israel.the bubble" is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian, the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist. the bubble" is also a beautiful film about people, gay and straight, inhabiting that strange city, tel-aviv, shown through the eyes of people who really care about them. the film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed, but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched.

the israeli/palestinian conflict persists and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries, few have a clue to the other aspect of the division - the group of people who want peace and work toward eradicating the separation. eytan fox, in the bubble ('ha-buah'), has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism, electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor, a lot of love, and a taste of brutal reality. it is a window into a situation that begs for understanding.in tel aviv three close friends are roommates: lulu (daniela virtzer), a beautiful young woman with strong opinions; yali (alon friedman), a very 'out' gay young man who works in a popular café; and noam (ohad knoller), a handsome, somewhat shy fellow who, in addition to his day job in a music shop, is a member of the national guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city's checkpoints. it is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young palestinian named ashraf (yousef 'joe' sweid), and a mutual attraction occurs. the three friends decide to 'stowaway' the illegally present ashraf (whom they nickname with an israeli name) and while ashraf and noam settle into a love relationship, yali hires ashraf at his café, and yali and lulu both proceed to find love interests, too. all goes well until ashraf must return home for his sister's wedding. though in tel aviv ashraf has been able to be openly gay with noam, life is far different in jerusalem: ashraf is told he must marry his sister's groom-to-be sister. in an attempt to rescue ashraf from his fate, noam and lulu disguise themselves as french reporters to gain access to ashraf. in a moment of supposed seclusion, noam and ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom-to-be, and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for ashraf to remain 'in the closet'.while the young people in tel aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence, an attack occurs in jerusalem - one that has grave consequences not only immediately, but also in the revenge mission ashraf must now assume. the ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is.the acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people. the story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes eytan fox such a fine writer/director. more people should watch this important and very fine film. in hebrew, arabic, and english with subtitles. grady harp

i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer. my hebrew is not fluent, so the subtitles were very useful, i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie. you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes.this movie blew me away!!!!!! it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today: a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian. it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously. the dilemma, the emotions entailed. the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see!!

i got this one a few weeks ago and love it! it's modern, light but filled with true complexities of life. it questions and answers, just like other eytan fox movies. this is my favorite, along with jossi & jagger. this pictures a lot more, universally, than only the bubbles we may live in. you don't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this - i'm not, but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies. at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further. relationships we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, deep, fatal, you name it. you don't know what's coming, and you definitely don't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time. it is worth seeing several times. fox movies include great bonus material - here a great music video and "the making of" (including explanation of the title, interviewing lior ashknenazi who plays himself in the movie and arabs with doubts about the israeli life styles).

i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves, then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie. now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering. her eyes are the mirror to his soul --and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are.those who take things literally will find marleen gorris' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating. romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.

it's one of the best movies i've seen in the last 2 years (i've seen the premier in tel-aviv, israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war has began...) this problem in communication between the people, that causes wars, is interesting me for a long time, and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls, straight and gays, jews and arabs... i've seen the bubble already 3 times, and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know, and the difference between them, like between tel aviv and jerusalem... the last time i saw it- was with my friend, who is a christian arab, and it was on the independence day of israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by the bubble!

eytan fox did it again : move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel aviv.i was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever.strongly recommend: it is a voyage for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective to the israelo-palestinian conflict.nota bene: there is central gay plot in the movie. if you do not think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as "just love". (and don't worry: the chick is hot too!)

the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time, or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace. if only it was that easy. but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better, as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. well, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge, which begets even more, in an ever-expanding bloodbath. both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side, which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation. where does it end? and apparently he missed the significance of "the bubble" referred to in the name, which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them, which is partly why they seemed so naive. (he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem, which tells me he wasn't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) i found it very brave of the director, the screenplay writer, and both star-crossed lovers, to update the romeo & juliet story to a modern troubled land, and to make both lovers male. let's be honest here: very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female (young love wins all hearts) -- but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that, incredibly, these same people would rather have them hate each other, then the conclusion is inevitable.

i am currently on vacation in israel for summer, and so was able to see this incredible film. a bit of a warning before i begin writing: i speak fluent hebrew, and so the hebrew parts were no problem; however, about a quarter (a bit less) of the film is in arabic, and i was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit. this did not detract from my understanding of the film, but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater.after a year of american cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships, it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet, "the bubble" surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting, witty dialogue, and relevant political climate.the film opens on a checkpoint on the israeli-palestinian border; for the first few moments, we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on. yet, this is an important element of this film's strength. the political situation, and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background. most importantly, tel aviv serves as a character of its own in this film. it is constantly referenced. street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged. the skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly, and ultimately the city evolves along with the film the film focuses on the love between noam (ohad knoller) and a palestinian immigrant, ashraf(yousef 'joe' sweid), with the societies of tel aviv and palestine serving as a constant foil. we always know that their relationship is forbidden, and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema. the love is incredibly strong, and stands as the centerpiece of the film. the secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong: flamboyant restaurant owner yelli's ( yousef 'joe' sweid) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider, golan (zohar liba), is particularly a source of amusement. the love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite, fine crafted works of art, and the cinematography is astounding: in the first love scene of the film, the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to lulu (daniela virtzer), and dissolves into a shot of noam and ashraf. this shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love.to give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy, but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate, so i will instead focus on the witty dialogue. even when watching this movie in my second language, i could not stop laughing throughout. lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven, and an analogy of sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber. this dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in cinema. the music used in the film is also particularly powerful. music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it, and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other. little elements like this truly elevate the film.i could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted.

marlene gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors. this sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony. john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance (i am usually not a fan of his); and emily watson is brilliant as well. well worth seeing.

this was an exteremely good historical drama. john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affectations such as his strange dancing. emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover natalia.the relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as 'eternal innocence' (i.e. 'lolita') are evident in this film. i think i will now go on to read the novel. it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye. brilliant movie!

this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson. turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought. watson also performs brilliantly.the story is about a phenomenal chess player (turturro) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. the film is presented in a non linear time, with multiple flashbacks of luzhin's childhood. through those, the complex character of luzhin is described. i have nothing more to say, but to suggest this film to anyone.

terrific film with a slightly slow start - give it a chance to get cooking. story builds in interest and complexity. characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. superb new york city locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "sex in the city" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the hbo/hollywood notion of new york city , sex and relationships. it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi, rosario dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).

the literary genius of vladimir navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. a magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past, ala' godfather ii, where we see young alexander, a child prodigy. he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. thinking alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. the old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander. in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. that day is nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. though the film unfortunately sways from its russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, alexander plays his role sublimely.the director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents king with your 3 paws & king, sacrificing the castle for mate. nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. the luzhin defense elegantly gives navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.

terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking. story builds in interest and complexity. characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments. superb new york city locations - gritty, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "sex in the city" - in fact, the entire film is an antidote to the hbo/hollywood notion of new york city , sex and relationships. it's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately. loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi, rosario dawson, and her love interest (forgot his name!).

overall, i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers.however, i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols' closer. one scene especially where adrian grenier's character is questioning rosario dawson's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owen's character is questioning julia roberts, although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in "love." also note that "anna" is the name of both dawson's and roberts' character. can't be coincidence. now closer is based on patrick marber's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzler's "reigen" so i'm not sure how this connection formed.anyone have an idea?

this film sat on my tivo for weeks before i watched it. i dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad. i was wrong; this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed-up libidos of new yorkers.the format is the same as max ophuls' "la ronde," based on a play by arthur schnitzler, who is given an "inspired by" credit. it starts from one person, a prostitute , standing on a street corner in brooklyn. she is picked up by a home contractor, who has sex with her on the hood of a car, but can't come. he refuses to pay her. when he's off peeing, she answers his cell phone and takes a message. she runs away with his keys.then the story switches to the contractor, who pays a professional call on a rich, bored new york woman, who plays with him until he is aroused, then she pulls away. she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is; he tells her how beautiful she is, and lucky. as he is leaving, she asks if he would have sex with her. she sits on top of him, bounces up and down. this time he comes, the he leaves.the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends. hubby (robert) is talking business, wife (ellen) is bored, and switches the subject to sex, and how often men and women think about it. husband switches conversation to desert. later, after the guests leave, ellen tries to entice robert into sex. robert wants none of it, and puts on a jazz record. ellen turns on the radio; robert turns up the music; ellen turns on the tv; robert turns on another tv. cacophony ensues. ellen goes up on the roof, robert joins her. ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men, men other than robert. robert says that he too needs to experience men.we next follow robert as he visits an artist, martin, played by steve buscemi. i wish buscemi could have more roles like this, where he is a sexy, smart, totally desirable guy. robert praises martin's work, much more than it deserves, promises to get it into a show. martin is excited, until it turns out that robert is speaking out of his groin, it is all a mating dance. robert tries to kiss martin, on the lips, and martin pulls back, saying that he is not gay. robert asserts that he's not gay either, martin scoffs. both admit that the artworks are bad. robert is about to leave, when martin allows robert to kiss him. they make out, and robert goes down on martin.next we follow martin, as he prepares for an art show at a manhattan gallery. he is smitten by the receptionist, anna, played by rosario dawson. (i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they make love to each other.we next follow anna, who is sitting at a lunch stand. her boyfriend, nick (adrian grenier), enters, bearing flowers. she is cold toward him; he tries to figure out why. he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in san francisco. she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex-gf while in san francisco, and had sex with her. the latter revelation turns out to be a lie. the two of them make out in the luncheonette, but she decides that they must break up. nick is heartbroken.and we follow nick, who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench, joey (carol kane). joey is sort of weird and child-like, but is a good audience for nick, who needs a sympathetic ear. the two of them go to coney island at night, and look at the stars. nick falls under joey's spell, despite the age difference between them. they go back to joey's apartment, and nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman. she is on top of him, doesn't want to let him go. but he manages to escape.(this is, by the way, the best carol kane role since she played latke's wife in taxi.) joey's phone rings, and it is a man calling the psychic friends network, and joey is one of the psychic friends. although she is still hurting from nick, she gradually gets into her psychic shtick. the man is at his office, late at night, and wants to have phone sex with her. although that is not joey's business, joey goes along, and coaxes the man to come. she wants to keep talking, although the man want to get off the phone, and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company, and will be found out tomorrow. his life is ruined. joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide, and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend, that she cares about him. and she does care about him.but the man packs a gun into his briefcase, and goes off to seek a prostitute on the brooklyn waterfront, and we come back to the beginning, to the same prostitute who started out la ronde. she wants to give him $75,000 in cash if she will kill him. he tried to kill himself, but couldn't do it. the prostitute does not want to do it, but he insists, holding her hand, holding the gun inside his mouth, telling her where to aim. eventually, the gun goes off, and we see the prostitute walking down the street, and arriving at the corner where she normally does business. the contractor who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up, rolls down the window. they look at each other. the end.

(question) what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand? (answer) a good start. well, i don't know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests, "love in the time of money" is a "good start". a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music, this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person c...etc...and back again ending with persons a & b in carousel fashion. the film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client. the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received. i watched the behemoth "angels in america" last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound. use caution. i may be the only person who really liked this flick. (b)

petter mattei's "love in the time of money" is a visually stunning film to watch. mr. mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect. each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.the acting is good under mr. mattei's direction. steve buscemi, rosario dawson, carol kane, michael imperioli, adrian grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.

in lizzie borden's "love crimes" (1992), sean young plays a gritty d.a. in atlanta. she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man (patrick bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them.naturally, this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey, intending to bring him to justice. they meet, they make love, then the next thing she knows, she is over his lap, getting spanked. (note: the spanking scene is only in the "unrated" version of this film. the r-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid.) this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images, such as bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, flailing at her with a riding crop.as a thriller, "love crimes" is at its best when sean young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end, it just stops. that's true. director lizzie borden may have just run out of story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits roll, and we are left with a puzzling "what just happened?" bewilderment.the unfolding of young's plan is played out in engaging style, but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewers.dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)

this is by far my favorite film of all time. that's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. however, i don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. sean young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. the other cast members do a fine job as well.have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? have you ever wondered why? the obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. it seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like "love crimes". sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today.

lizzie borden's love crimes is an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and including full frontal female nudity, which sure beats the male kind). it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory.this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust.one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses, when the antagonist, a counterfeit fashion photographer, is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse. he shoves a riding crop between her legs, pressing it against her crotch, and this greatly increases her excitement.then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door.patrick bergin plays the con artist, and though he falls a long distance from handsome, he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line. by all reports, sean young proves a weird person, and she is scarcely beautiful. yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination. her performance is forceful and complex.borden possesses an intriguing worldview, and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate.

the story-line was rather interesting, but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior. more extreme than necessary. also, i think something went wrong in the casting. john turtorro doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak of the italian player. motives weren't very much outlined either.

as a psychiatrist specialized in trauma, i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma, even a trauma. it not only explains the enormous difficulties those people have to cope wither, but that even love is sometimes not enough. but she tries!

this movie stars emily watson, of breaking the waves fame. this movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is being held. a chess master arrives and shortly after falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by emily watson. she falls for this oddball of a man, who is obsessed with chess. this is all at the dismay of her mother, who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a proper gentleman. her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman, as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such. what ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche. it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present. emily watson is amazing in this, as well as the actor who plays the main character. it is definitely slow, but is well worth the watching. the ending was even satisfying. :)

this movie was well done in all respects. the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving. it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods "white hunter,black heart". this movie is simply the best.cheers zuf

despite the lack of logic present in the storyline, kill shot is a highly enjoyable film. through a moving performance kasper van dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son. each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name i cannot recall. a shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers, but as a whole kill shot truly delivers a death blow.

this movie's origins are a mystery to me, as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it. i assume that before "starship troopers", "killshot" was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network, cable, or otherwise. the new title of "kill shot" is comically thrown into the opening sequence, the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. the quick cuts, cheesy "melrose place" music, and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you're in for.and i don't mind at all. i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers (an excellent book, in my opinion, not so hot a movie - but that's another review). after looking it up on imdb, my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career (see bond-girl and wild things references here). they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r-rated status - coveted in suspense video rental sections, that is. in any event, they should have left it unrated if you're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section.all in all, it's entertaining. i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it's a tv pilot, though. that was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show, the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual.would i rent it again? no. would i watch this tv show? well, why not - it's better than baywatch. and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. token black guy (who's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating), token asian (japanese, i assume from the name koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women, beautiful, intelligent latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family's bank account - this show probably would have done ok.but as a movie it just cracks me.i gave it a 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was forced to become. it made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all i ask of rentals.

don't know how this missed award nominations. great film. certainly of the calibre of "beautiful mind" great acting, photography, script and drama. i can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film.

not having read nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, i could only view "the luzhin defence" as a movie. it works really well as one of my favorite genres "sports romances." the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say "searching for bobby fischer," in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.through the feminist director maureen gorris (of "antonia"), emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with john turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.the settings in italy and hungary are beautiful.(originally written 5/27/2001)

once again proving his amazing versatility, john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament, and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident (emily watson) at a 1920's italian hotel. they fall in love,to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (geraldine james).a wonderful love story, whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.but in spite of its origins in a nabakov story, it certainly is not .the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down.john turturro, having appeared in "barton fink" ,"o brother,where art thou?" "the big lebowski" proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature.

a brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. on itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. so, there is more. there is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.this film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. it's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. the added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting.i have no idea of the strength of the chess players as i don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. all in all, most of the film goes down very easily. it is also forgotten again very easily though. so it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place

i don't see how this show is like the oc at all. first of all, the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life. north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time. second, the oc takes place in california. north shore takes place in hawaii.and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network? i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part. it has a good storyline and plot. i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out. the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out. it wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows. i hope fox keeps it on the air.

i loved it and was so shattered that there not making another season!!! i wish they would! it was the best show ever!!!!!! there's probably not any chance of them deciding to not cancel the show is there! ha ha i wish there was though! i would be so so excited!! i really would! i miss it! and was especially shattered not to know what happens to jason!! i think they should make another one.... it i also think its silly that u have to writr ten lines to post a comment.. it makes your comment drag on..and no one will read it!! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole... maybe they could make a spin off!!

i'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it; after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii. with the cast, the location, style of the directing and its publicity  shows women walking around on the beach and all that. no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it.it was wrong of them to do that. cause after i decide to watch the show, there are actually more thing going on, real juicy story and conflict, turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much  addictive.the story of the hotel clerks, the manager, the owner and their complicated love life. also enter the troublesome hotel's visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel. it actually more exciting than it sounds here.i won't deny that the acting suck but it ain't that bad that you'll look away. the story is not so consistence but good enough. the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time. i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience.recommendation: i really do enjoy watching this. zillion times better than expected.rating: 7.5/10 (grade: b)please rate my review after reading it, thanks.

hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6. i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film.in this film, the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. he is famous for a game he played against steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz. instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament hall, never to return.the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments. chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life. a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer. although a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways.in the film, a world championship match is depicted, as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin. the format is a knockout, which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself - going from 128 players to just 2 in the final. but this was a group knockout - which also depicts a realistic format, where the winners of each group play against each other.the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself. in fact, i have done a youtube video about it, for you to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=xzptdtphwdm best wishes tryfon

the only show i have watched since 90210! why did they discontinue it? it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all! the least they should do is release it on dvd! i checked out similar shows, but nothing has come close. the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation. they made a big mistake by pulling that show. if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here. thanks! aloha!

i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert, luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.

emily watson's natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen. she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. or, is she transmuted to the king? the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. the period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century italy's lake district is captured magnificently. not a single square of space is wasted.so many brilliant scenes abound, i cannot recount them all. i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting. i did not read nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of my own, what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, barry levinson's the natural. it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american. well, the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment. the true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. but, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit. pure love, as personified by emily watson's natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously. only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it.this is a magnificent movie (10/10).

the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game. so many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and i don't understand why. while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me. i will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be forewarned, i do talk about things that happen in the movie.**** possible spoilers **** be forewarned!****his is a life of "large moves" versus "small moves". he chooses natalia to be his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy. listen closely to that description.when someone asks him a question, he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. (the flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well, for they give not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. it's stunning.various characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. beautifully done.i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin, but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.this film is constantly working on many levels, which is why i endorse it. it was a treat and a joy to watch.if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh. the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces.

this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great. maybe this is because gorris' takes nabokov's initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation. the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov's one.the only thing in the movie which i don't like is the influence of valentinov's on luzhin's destiny. i can't imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel's argument.

this is a poem on film, wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry. it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly. (italy's lake district in the twenties.) it's a love story with a twist. the characters are unique and believable. the settings are deliciously exotic. some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor --- are beautiful images. and rather than the mandatory happy ending, this story has a bitter sweet one. if film is an art, this is close to a masterpiece.

very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years ,but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it,john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man ,nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces ,the game validates him as a person ,when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion,even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.it makes you wonder if there other luzon's out there who obsess about the game,i am sure they are,if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it.its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well,it achieves its objectives,unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel.

the legend of andrei konchalovsky's towering 4 and a half hour poem to siberia is not to begin at once, because it must hold back for space, because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half-remembered childhood memories in a turn-of-the-century backwoods village, yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the soviet working spirit. konchalovsky celebrates soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like soy cuba and invincible the mood turns somber and reflective. news of the revolution reach the secluded siberian village through the grapevine. the fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist. through all this, konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual, with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back, waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancé's father with an axe, the irreverent folly of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late, came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland, the despair and resignation of the middle-aged regional party leader who comes back to his small siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant. the movie segues from decade to decade from the 10's to the 80's with amazing newsreel footage trailing soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire (terrific visuals here! all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces) but the actual movie focuses on the individual, on triumphs and follies small and big. by the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in; of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning. "it can't matter", seems like the world is saying, to which konchalovksy answers "it must matter" because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption.yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape' something seems to hover, shadowy, almost substanceless, like the eternal old man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists, sometimes a mere spectactor, sometimes the enigmatic sage; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters, something invisible seems to lurk. ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams, repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky, a curious bear, indeed the eternal old man himself; konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order. in its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them, often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time, and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism, it reminds me of shohei imamura's the profound desires of the gods. when, in a dream scene, alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of stalin to reach out at his (dead) father as he vanishes in the fog, the movie hints at the betrayal of the soviet dream, or better yet, at all the things lost in the revolution, this betrayal made more explicit in the film's fiery denouement. the amazing visuals, elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge, help seal the deal. by the end of it, an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema.

for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure. the story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s).the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village, who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. his son, by the local beauty, fights the germans during the second world war. when he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism.this film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made. it can be seen in three parts.

it is a story of siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. it is about passion and feelings, about russian soul, and very romantic. this movie is not action packed, it flowes slowely. in second part one can find great songs - russian romances. it is much more better than doctor zhivago. the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example.

i have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take (because of its length and story), i liked it very much. i was impressed first, by the script and then, by the realization of this script. the film takes you on a ride, but that is not an easy, joyful ride; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people's lives. what i loved was the inner logic the film followed; logic, which just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end, when i thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. it makes no sense though to try to re-tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time. i also liked very much nikita mikhalkov's character aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics would saw, with restless abandon. what i didn't like about it, was that i think he later played characters that remind me of aleksei in films like "cruel romance" (zhestokij romans, which i actually love) and to some extent in "the insulted and the injured" ("unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "sibiriada" shows, i think, what a great film-maker andrei konchalovski was before he went to hollywood and made forgettable films like "tango and cash" and less forgettable like "runaway train". i would prefer "kurochka ryaba" to them...

i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered konchalovsky's "siberiade"; tarkosvky's "stalker" and danelia'a "autumn marathon". i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. then and only then, i saw "siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. way better then bertolucci's "1900". by far!hope andron will somehow get to the negative and make "director's restored version full lenght " someday! on dvd of course! also i fiercely fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste! time is on my side.

alexandr "sascha" luzhin (john turturro) is a former leading chess player attempting a comeback at an italy-hosted tournament. his brilliance is unquestioned but his obsession with chess has stunted his growth in all other aspects of his life. natalia (emily watson) is a beautiful heiress who has come to the same resort with her mother, vera (geraldine james) to scope out possible marriage partners. vera leans toward a handsome count but, astonishingly, natalia is more fascinated by sascha, whom she met on a walk. sascha, too, is taken with natalia and proposes marriage at their second meeting. but, with the concentration that sascha must give to the chess matches and, with other happenings in his past still causing problems, will he win the heart of natalia? oh, and can he become the chess champion, also? this is a lovely film, based on a novel by nabokov. the acting is amazing, with watson very fine as the beautiful little rich girl and turturro utter perfection as the shy, awkward chess enthusiast. james gives quite a nice turn as the overbearing mother and the other cast members are wonderful as well. as for the look of the film, it could not be better. the scenery is of the put-your-eye-out variety, the vintage costumes are gorgeous and the cinematography is deserving of much applause. yes, the story is unusual and told with the use of flashbacks, at times, making it a film not everyone will appreciate. then, too, the ending is bittersweet. however, if you love romance, period pieces, great acting, knockout scenery, or the fine art of motion picture creation, don't miss this one. you will be defenseless in resisting its multitude of charms.

'the luzhin defence' is a good film with fine central performances, but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker's craft shines through. it felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along. marlene gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of luzhin, rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others.adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. this film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between luzhin and natalia. natalia's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film. i felt that i was put through luzhin's torment and eventual tragic end, without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled. however, this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one.

i first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when i have an opportunity. it is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics. should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated, ignore them... this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music. the dancing isn't as important in this film as in other astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through. see this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely amusing. so i know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies can't really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds. no one i know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused. the only problem with the film: fred astaire singing without dancing. he may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. the comedy gets a bit cliché at times but the vaudevillesque performances of g burns and g allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs. give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one.

this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire-ginger rogers film--the plot outline, dance numbers, zippy music and the entire formula is there...except for ginger! whether it really was originally intended as a re-pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films. instead of the usual sidekicks for fred (such as eric blore or edward everett horton), burns and allen are used--probably since despite being known as a comedy team, they could sing and dance quite well. this actually shocked me, but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and gracie or these two along with george. only once, at the very end, does ms. fontaine dance with fred but it's very brief and with a distant camera shot.and speaking of burns and allen, i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film. i have never been a fan of their show or their movies. in general, i find gracie's idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full-length films. however, in this film i must admit that they were great--not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett horton very nicely. they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department.now as for the rest of the film, it's all a lot of fun and is entertaining. the problem for me, though, was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie--not just because she was acting outside her range (after all, she wasn't a singer or dancer), but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint. because of this, the usual balance and great boy-girl dialog was lacking. there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid--all because he wanted to win a bet! and finally, i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence--it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch! overall, i did like the film quite a bit--it had a lot of charm and excellent writing. unfortunately, it also featured a bland performance by ms. fontaine that knocks off a point--bringing my score for this film to 7.

soon americans would swarm over a darkened, damaged england preparing to invade europe, but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny, slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing, idyllic diversion. american dancing star & heartthrob jerry halliday (astaire), on a european tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager (burns), is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton (fontaine). the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by (and rigged for) head butler keggs (gardiner), who's betting on lady alice's cousin reggie (noble), the favorite of alice's stuffy, domineering aunt (collier). the story would have been much better as a half-hour tv episode. the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full-length film. both alice & jerry appear impossibly (and annoyingly) clueless by the second half of the film. the amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag. fontaine is too beautiful, too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde, no matter how aristocratic, while young footman albert (watson) is painfully awful. but while "damsel" is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent, the talent doesn't let us down. astaire's romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes, both solo & with burns & allen, are up to par, though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame. gracie nearly steals the whole show as george's bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded, conniving & coolly self-confident. her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one-of-a-kind classic. this & astaire's priceless scene with the madrigal singers give "damsel" a delightful color of naive but noble-spirited americans mixing with noble but dull-spirited englishmen. gershwin is at the top of his game with "nice work if you can get it" & "stiff upper lip," which carry the film through its weak points. and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment? "damsel" is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star. it's a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again.

i read that jessie matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with fred astaire in damsel in distress. jessie matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films. if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.it's a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it. fred astaire, story and adapted to screen by author p.g. wodehouse, burns&allen for comedy, and songs by the gershwin brothers. in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it, there isn't much you could ask more for this film.except a leading lady. though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire, damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team. young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astaire.her character has none of the bite that ginger rogers's parts do in these films. all she basically has to do is act sweet and demure. she also doesn't contribute anything musically. and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire, joan fontaine would come out at the bottom. the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number. when she co-starred later on in a musical with bing crosby, the emperor waltz, it's no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to do.the version i have is a colorized one and in this case i think it actually did some good. the idyllic lush green english countryside of p.g. wodehouse is really brought out in this vhs copy. especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the garden.burns&allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number. the surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged.p.g. wodehouse's aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaine's father as a nice man on film.the biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a foggy day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down. done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire, it's one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even after.overlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine, a damsel in distress rates as a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classic comedy. who could ask for anything more?

'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess grandmaster, and emily watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family. the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. all in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster, and turturro and watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.

a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs, fred astaire, joan fontaine, and a terrific supporting cast headed by gracie allen and george burns.typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his publicist and allen his secretary. they concoct a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right. he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a domineering aunt and docile father. silly plot.the great songs include a foggy day, things are looking up, nice work if you can get it, and i can't be bothered now. fontaine does not sing, but does a brief (and decent) number with astaire. surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen, including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park.also in the cast are reginald gardiner, constance collier, montagu love, harry watson (as albert), ray noble, and my favorite--jan duggan as the lead madrigal singer.jan duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio who sings nice work if you can get it. her facial expressions are hilarious. she was also a scene stealer in the w.c. fields comedy, the old fashioned way, playing cleopatra pepperday.much abuse has been heaped on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would have been hideously miscast. the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie matthews were considered. yikes. two more would-be disasters. fontaine is fine as alyce and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire, with ample comic relief by burns and allen.fun film, great songs, good cast, and jan duggan in a rare spotlight!

joan fontaine is "a damsel in distress" in this 1937 musical starring fred astaire, george burns, and gracie allen. the plot, what there is of it, is about a british woman (fontaine) in love with an american, who is mistaken for astaire, a musical comedy star.the film, directed by george stevens, contains some wonderful gershwin music, including "nice work if you can get it" and "a foggy day." the best scene is the "stiff upper lip" number, which takes place in a fun house.astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. burns plays his over the top publicist and allen is burns' secretary. she's hilarious. the problem, as others have pointed out, is fontaine, who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film. stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy.definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.

this musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable. the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse's novel, but none of its virtues, though he co-wrote the script. the songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular film, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-oklahoma standards. burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently, but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points.there are a few high points. reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie, and stops mugging like a silent actor. and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse, though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied.

back when musicals weren't showcases for choreographers, we had wonderful movies such as this one.being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie. not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood, but close enough. some of the american vaudeville humour, the slapstick not the witty banter, clash with wodehouse's british sense of humour. but on the whole, the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures.some inventive staging for the dance numbers, including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number. they seem a lot more realistic, if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic.the lack of ginger rogers and eric blore don't hurt the movie, instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge. it's also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest. instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest, far more in keeping with wodehouses' young aristocratic females.

in a famous essay he wrote about charles dickens, george orwell points out that many readers always regretted that dickens never continued writing like he did in pickwick papers: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. this would not have been too difficult for dickens. his contemporary robert surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (mr. fancy romford's hounds is a title of one of his novels). among hunters and horse lovers surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, sketches by boz, was also a funny book). so dickens third book is oliver twist (which got pretty grim at points). orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that.but orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. surtees, as i said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. but p.g.wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the british social system. his earl of emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in england than being...well earl of emsworth! his psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. his stanley uckridge will always have a "perfect" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). and best of all, his jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept bertie wooster, his boss. since wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. they served (and still serve) their purposes. in fact, compared wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary evelyn waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. the best of waugh remains among the high points of 20th century british literature: brideshead revisited, decline and fall, and the rest. but in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold. while wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as waugh's did.wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear "bill" in the score of showboat, it is not kern and hammerstein's tune, but kern and wodehouse's tune transposed from "oh lady, lady" a dozen years earlier). he was a handy dramatist too. so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel a damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here.it has the normal wodehouse touches. that perfect butler keggs (reginald gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a "friendly" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. he is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing italian opera - despite constance collier's attempts to control his impulse. this is typical wodehouse characterization. so is the way the love affair between lady alyce and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of keggs and young albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.wodehouse was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with. it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as six of a kind and we're not dressing) george and gracie did their best support with fred astaire. the fun house sequence, which includes the song "stiff upper lip", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a "whisk broom" dance (that astaire learned from burns). but gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by wodehouse in scenes with gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only albert happens to notice keggs/gardiner's mistake, and looks at gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). her dialog with lady caroline (collier)'s son reggie (ray noble, the british band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to gracie as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too.the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it, and the weakness of joan fontaine. fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. but the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, gershwin's music, and wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.

i couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when i read about fred astaire teaming up with george burns & gracie allen in a movie with a script by p.g. wodehouse and music by the gershwins. it is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred & ginger movies.the story would probably be better to read in a wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).but...! the funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. i never knew that gracie allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! she keeps up wonderfully with astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.several nice songs, particularly fun are nice work if you can get it and stiff upper lip.recommended for fans of astaire, burns & allen. i had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.

first of all, in defense of joan fontaine, it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce, the young british lady who has the title role. fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here, but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned. fortunately, she went on to better things.but here it's fred astaire, george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing--and they are excellent. fans of burns & allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire's dance routines. especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar. they join astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight.unfortunately, not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story--nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer. it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment. only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs.some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner, at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant, constance collier and montagu love (as joan's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire).it's a lighthearted romp whenever burns & allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days. both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire's footwork.director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera-work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire's dance partner, something she seems painfully aware of.

disregard the plot and enjoy fred astaire doing a foggy day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless joan fontaine. here we see astaire doing what are essentially "stage" dances in a purer form than in his films with ginger rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. best of all: the fact that we see burns and allen before their radio/tv husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their paramount college films from the 30s. (george was once a tap dance instructor). their two numbers with fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. the first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the "chin up" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. it almost seems spontaneous. fan of fred astaire and burns & allen will find it worth bearing up under the "plot". i've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.

i gave this film 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for e.g amadeus, and 9 for slumdog millionaire most recently. this film is close to slumdog, but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life, mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully. to understand it you really need to be one of balkan. this is an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary of his previous films, which are boring at this time, i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie. i like humour (balkan humour), photography is an art itself, each scene is artistic to the limit. plot is probably a fairy tale , don't recall it now, but remember reading to my daughter-going-to sleep a similar story.

not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins. if you don't have any of these you can not understand it. and if you don't understand, you can't enjoy it. :) for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen, probably if you see a picasso's painting you just will walk by it, deciding that it's a trash-work of some street painter. :) so do not judge, before trying to understand it :) in the end i think it's a must for every one with open minds. still my n1 remains the shawshank redemption! and remember that not all things can be put in frames. because there are things in this world, that any frame just won't fit.

a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to ralph fiennes, who would have murdered it.) similarly, emily watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). to reach the tortured chess master (turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.	in a chance meeting between natalia (watson) and luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with "bold, brilliant moves" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).	the italian sets are stunning. the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deservedly so. chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed. although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.

the movie celebrates life.the world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has "happy end", just like in the closing scene of the movie.the movie has wonderful soundtrack, mixture of serbian neofolk, gypsy music and jazz.this movie is very refreshing piece of visual poetics.the watching experience is like you've been sucked in another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world.like mr. kusturica movie should be.

it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'zavet' as well as of many other films of kusturica. see for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn. kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. it's a fun film before all. kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies. his style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. the space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema.this is not a perfect film either. the principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. it is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that i have seen lately.

before 'zavet' there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision. they find their own, poetic style, and then they cowardly become prisoners of it. burton has (and still have) depp, kusturica has miki manojlovic, and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again. however, there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time. that's main reason why kusturica's worst movies are 'black cat white cat' and 'life is miracle'. 'zavet' is something completely different. you may like it, you may hate it, but this is not just another kusturica poetic  balkanic dreamlike stuff. of course, if you want to be praised, you have to play safe. it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award. fortunately, as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works. 'zavet' can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself. it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously. this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest, like bergman or kubrick, didn't have. this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd, so absurd that becomes deep, and so unfunny that becomes hilarious. same stuff that make 'plan 9 from outer space' cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it. average western viewer would not get few references. most notable, tire shop owner is srbljanovic , and this refers to biljana srbljanovic, famous serbian dramatic writer. politically, she is very active as left oriented liberal, and she despises kusturica's political views and anarchism. kusturica's 'everything but not subtle' take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop. second reference is made to goran bregovic  previous kusturica's composer. he formed 'funeral and wedding orchestra' and start performing around europe. although he is praised as big composer, bregovic is just performer and most of his songs (if not all) are poor covers of traditional serbian songs. kusturica's take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral, with funeral mocking the wedding. also, music is covering western classics as 'london bridge is falling down' or french lullabies. you find this unfunny? now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic's horrible covers. i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep, it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody, and it is beautifully directed, as all of his works are. if you like previous kusturica's movies, there is a big chance that you will hate this. if you don't like couple of his last movies, you may find this as pleasant surprise, because this is like fellini directing 'pink flamingos'. on purpose. i have massive respect for this guy after 'zavet'. next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces. next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth. that's the reason why he is most interesting director on earth, whether you like it or not.

for those of you who are not aware with the theme that kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the western assault on traditional serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. this continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that kusturica has elected to mandate. since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground', kusturica's films' 'black cat white cat', 'life is a miracle', and recently with 'promise me this', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. in the case of 'promise me this', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. the world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. the end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. they are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. yet kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. with his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.

kusturika made it again. another masterpiece. a coral comedy full of his own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! the music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, everything colorfully visual to entertain only. pure cinema in essence. a wonderful experience to watch. and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare, and so wonderful. well, this is one, and if you enjoyed kusturica's previous films, you'll love this, although, as in all comedies, it is about a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for it.

"father is still away on business" was headline of an review after "promise me this" premiere in cannes. i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics can't touch him. i had two hours of pure energy without rest. even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled. surprisingly good performance of stribor kusturica. much more close-ups and less landscapes then in "life is a miracle". marija petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential, please don't spoil it. surely, i recommend to everyone to see this film.

i don't know why some guys from us, georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all. for those who did not watch this movie - watch it. don't expect too much or don't put some frameworks just because this is kosturica. watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor inside - people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages, gypsies in all balkans are always try to f*ck you up in any way they can, love is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and balkans are extremely creative. for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american's sh*t (like meet dave, get smart etc) are much much worse than a pure, frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me. the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer. i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside. it is simple, but true. it is brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh to dead.

part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson (2 reasons enough to watch), was a period piece and involved chess. everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. i shan't, therefore, give away much more. suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him. it's about love and obsession, rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour, became totally compelling. and i defy anyone to second-guess the ending.

walking home after the film, i was humming the familiar waltz music that natalia and alexandre were dancing to. i've heard that before - where? ah, from kubrick's "eyes wide shut" (track 2), 'got it just as i arrived at the door. it's "waltz no. 2 from jazz suite no. 2" composed by dimitri shostakovich, performed here by the city of prague philharmonic orchestra. yes, i went and picked up the soundtrack from tower's. what a treat! the film score by alexandre desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz. it's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score. reminds me of favorite scores by maurice jarre, ennio morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of "nuovo cinema paradiso"), georges delerue, and john barry. there are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp. emily watson and john turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance. the love story, their intimate connection, is very much between alexandre and natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both. director marleen gorris of "antonia's line" (1996 academy award's best foreign language film from the netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect. the front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess. beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's. cinematography captures the serene beauty of lake como in northern italy near the swiss border.i highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies. alexandre desplat's lyrical film score of "the luzhin defence" is complete.

obsession comes in many flavors, and exists for a variety of reasons; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder, but for others it may be an avenue of survival. lack of nurturing, combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements, may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone. and in extreme cases, the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession, driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing, and as we discover in `the luzhin defence,' directed by marleen gorris, a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and in fact, may actually exacerbate the situation. obsession, it seems, has no prejudice or preference; moreover, it gives no quarter.	at an italian resort in the 1920's, alexander luzhin (john turturro) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament, the winner of which will be the world champion. luzhin is a master of the game, but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him; rather, it is his obsession, that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life, and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family. so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel, a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands, and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament. that man is valentinov (stuart wilson), luzhin's former mentor, who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin.	valentinov is an unwelcomed, disconcerting presence to luzhin, and once again life threatens to overwhelm him. not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament, turati (fabio sartor), against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours, but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life-- his feelings for a young woman he's just met at the resort, natalia (emily watson). and, genius though he may be, dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace, as well the curse, of his entire life.	to tell luzhin's story, gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess. and as his background is established, it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life. for the scenes of his childhood, gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into, and underlies, the present, more pastoral setting of the resort. the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled, and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting, yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well. she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov, concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense, which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film, making luzhin's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling.	the single element that makes this film so memorable, however, is the affecting performance of john turturro. for this film to work, luzhin must be absolutely believable; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous, as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately. it doesn't happen, however, and the film does work, because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life. he captures luzhin's genius, as well as his inadequacies, and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real. it's a performance equal to, if not surpassing, geoffrey rush's portrayal of david helfgott in `shine.' and when you compare his work here with other characters he's created, from sid lidz in `unstrung heroes' to pete in `o brother where art thou?' to al fountain in `box of moonlight,' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor, and what a remarkable artist he truly is.	as natalia, emily watson is excellent, as well, turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely. though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin, watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective. most importantly, because of the detail she brings to her performance, it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story. you have but to look into watson's eyes to know that the feelings she's conveying are real. it's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor.	the supporting cast includes geraldine james (vera), christopher thompson (stassard), peter blythe (ilya), orla brady (anna), mark tandy (luzhin's father), kelly hunter (luzhin's mother), alexander hunting (young luzhin) and luigi petrucci (santucci). well crafted and delivered, `the luzhin defence' is an emotionally involving film, presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man's inhumanity to man. we don't need a movie, of course, to tell us that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget, inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change, and to make a difference in the lives of those around us. i rate this one 9/10.   

man's castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration. the proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a hooverville.spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco, the start of a slew of classic roles, he's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in loretta young.one of the things about man's castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men. women had some additional strains put on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had it twice as hard. and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. spence takes loretta young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle. pretty soon though they're in love, though tracy is not the kind to settle down.the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of man's castle. and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously.also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, marjorie rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl, a really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well. hohl brings the plot of man's castle to its climax through his scheming. man's castle is grim look at the great depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.

this is very dated, but that's part of the charm with this 1933 movie. you can say the same for most pre-code films; they're just different, and usually in an interesting way.it was the short running time, the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young's character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy-but-intriguing film.you'd be hard-pressed to find a nicer girl than "trinna," played by the 20-year-old young who was already into making her 50th movie! (she started acting as a small child. that, and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days.) the camera, although in soft focus throughout much of the film, zoomed in on loretta's face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty.playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life, tracy's "bill" slowly transformed into a loving man, thanks to trinna. spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting.although they have small roles, supporting actors walter connolly, marjorie rambeau, arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this 75-minute film. i was particularly fascinated with connolly's role as the minister/father figure of the camp.the story is a little far-fetched but - hey - that's the movies. this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a "hooverville"-type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale.

as other reviewers have noted, this is an unjustly neglected depression-era film. directed by frank borzage (two oscars) and written by jo swerling (leave her to heaven, the westerner, lifeboat, etc.), it is a tough-minded, well-structured and -realized move about denizens of a new york city shantytown. they're grifters, beggars, and women forced into prostitution, but they're a community of people both good and bad, with loyalties as complex as any group's.perhaps primary among this movie's many admirable qualities is the contrast between spencer tracy's character, bill, and loretta young's trina. he tough-talking, physically aggressive, and evidently fearless-- but bill is not the character who gives this film its steely sense of survival. while he blusters, trina actually hangs tough (if that term can be applied to a character so ladylike). her devotion to him is obvious, and complete. when she becomes pregnant, she says she will raise it herself if he wants to leave, or "i'll even give up the kid if you'll only be happy." such is the dignity of loretta young's performance (at age 20) as a quite simple character, that she seems neither weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it, and wants nothing more.

it's a shame this movie is so hard to get your hands on in the us. i found it through a rare video dealer, and it was certainly worth it. this is, without a doubt, the best film made during the pre-code era, and the finest film of the 1930s. masterful director frank borzage made wonderful films about the depression, and with man's castle he created a fairy tale amidst the hardships of the era.loretta young and spencer tracy have a wonderful chemistry between them, and they help make this movie a wonderful romance. young's trina is sweet and hopeful, while tracy's bill is gruff and closed-off. the dynamic between the character creates one of the most difficult, but in the end rewarding relationships on film.man's castle is the most soft-focus pre-code film i've seen. borzage uses the hazy and dreamy technique to turn the squatter's village where bill and trina live into a palace. the hardships of the depression are never ignored, in fact they're integral to the film. but as borzage crafts the film as a soft focus fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation seem less harsh. it makes the film warm and affectionate.man's castle is the crowning achievement of the pre-code era. if only more people could see it.

i generally find loretta young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. but in this lyrical frank borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour spencer tracy, she's direct and honest and irresistible. it's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a hooverville, unusually up-front about the depression yet romantic and idealized. tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take "regular guy" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. there's good supporting work from marjorie rambeau and glenda farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and jo swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient. but the real heroes are borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up, and young. you sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion.

unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty-town. it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers, and it's a surpassing example of how the director, frank borzage, was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty, crime, and horrendous social inequity, which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were. this film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need, and it is totally life-affirming. this is a real masterpiece of the period, and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known.

man's castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code film. it involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. spencer tracy plays bill, a free soul without a dime in his pocket. he makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. one night, he meets trina, a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone. she has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days, but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship. his free spirit tempts him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a true spark between the two, even if they live in a shack by the river.tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. his characters are amazing and relatable. we can see his thoughts on his face, making him easy to identify with, even if we believe he is behaving badly. young is great in pre-code films. her character is very sweet but far from perfect, making her all the more likable.pre-code elements include skinny dipping, pregnancy before marriage, and crime.

i came in in the middle of this film so i had no idea about any credits or even its title till i looked it up here, where i see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators. i'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as i watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a coplandesque americana style. my surprise was great when i discovered the score to have been written by none other than john williams himself. true he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as schindler's list but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as star wars. but in my opinion what williams has written for this movie surpasses anything i've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie. and another recent score of his, for catch me if you can, shows still more wit and sophistication. as to stanley and iris, i like education movies like how green was my valley and konrack, that one with john voigt and his young african american charges in south carolina, and danny devito's renaissance man, etc. they tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story which can't be told often enough. this one is an excellent addition to that genre.

hardly a masterpiece. not so well written. beautiful cinematography i think not. this movie wasn't too terrible but it wasn't that much better than average. the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was... should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically "because mom says we can't." some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters. couple times i was wondering if the writer/director was a fan of george lucas' classic american graffiti. not that it's wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that, i mean come on! worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part, i mean double come on!! she was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. (take a good listen, it was there even though her character was from california! doh!!) maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie. oh well, what can ya do when you have a director who's just a director and not an artist, also. too bad. overall i give this a b- and that's being a little generous 'cause i'm partial to ms. amick.

this movie is one of my very favorites. it's hard to explain why. maybe it's the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. also, some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves. finally, the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings, and the last scene is so bittersweet. all in all, i love this movie; it's perfect for a gooey, sentimental girls' night.

i was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television. being raised in texas, i understood the boredom & monotony of teenage life there. this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart & i remembered it fondly through the past 12 years. i recently got to see it for the 2nd, 3rd & 4th times thanks the the love channel. i still cry because the movie reaches in & touches my inner confused teenager.

if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen movie.i think it is up there with mischief/book of love/high school usa/shout/calender girl/crybaby/ all great movies set in the lat 50s & early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still great.it is all so very funny at times and has a great love interest.all the young cast are great.i wish there were more type of these wonderful movies.my favourite movie of all time is back to the future when marty mcfly gos back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab 50s(early 60s) there are some movies of this type better than this but not many.

himy name is jessica, i'm italian!some time ago i have seen this film : ' for the very first time', with corin corky nemec. it was the story of micheal and mary margaret. i need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in micheal's bedroom.in italy this film hasn't been programmed for many years and i don't know how to find the song. a lot of thanks for who can help me! i love this film! is very romantic! the soundtrack is beautiful! i love cheryl pollack! jessica

this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it isn't on any of her collections.the reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending,unlike all her other films.its also not a musical,although she does belt out one song called' the world owes me a living'.the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white,the version i have is in colour and on vhs,i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic,unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful.the film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all,i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake.at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five.although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it,especially when {jerry}gary cooper steals a necklace,and hides it in shirley's teddy bear.the tension and slow build up to his actions,{while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directed.gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.in all this is a good film from the early 30's,accept it for its age.

even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by "now and forever." the movie was filmed with paramount studios  not with shirley's parent company twentieth century fox  in 1934, before fox producer darryl zanuck had perfected the successful shirley formula (cute songs, cold hearts for her to melt, young couples for her to play cupid to, happy endings). thus "now and forever" falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story. it is an awkward position for any movie, but this impressive, talented cast makes it work.gary cooper and carole lombard star as fun-loving, irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day. the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart. when they are suddenly landed with custody of jerry's young daughter penny (shirley temple), it is toni  and not penny, as many believe  who persuades jerry to give up his criminal career. but jerry flounders at his desk job, and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family, he soon returns to thieving and dishonesty. in a standard shirley device, penny tries to melt the heart of crusty curmudgeon felix evans, the victim of one of jerry's cons, but her attempt fails, for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself, and he blackmails jerry into helping him steal jewels. the drama, gunfight, death, and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine. there is no happy ending, no dancing, and only one song sequence (the cute number "the world owes me a living").but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid "now and forever." rather, it's divergence from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films. but beware: you should avoid colorized version of this film, and see it in black-and-white if you can. the color is bright, garish, and unrealistic, and in many scenes, shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blonde. yikes!

the only reason i came across this movie was that it's on the little miss marker dvd and i do recommend watching it although you won't like it as well as the better known movie.we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion. the film starts out quite light, but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from his brother-in-law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother-in-law elects to keep her. however, he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops.cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in. there's little music in this, and shirley only has one song. however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss marker.

my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again. this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch; i watch it over and over again and love the music!

john travolta, the biggest honkeytonk in the world, and a mechanical bull...what more can you ask for! yeah, you're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one. yet, i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance. bud (travolta) and sissy (debra winger) meet at gilley's and fall in love. they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have. the honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing, mechanical bull riding, and -of course- the required brawls. it has a good, 1980 country soundtrack, featuring "looking for love in all the wrong places", "the devil went down to georgia", and "hello texas" by my favorite jimmy buffett. break out your cowboy boots and have a boot-scootin' boogie! *** (out of 4)

don't mind the soundtrack, which is played out by now.still, debra winger is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her, she is quite good as cissy, girl from the wrong side of the tracks, lived in trailer with bud, (travolta), only to be replaced for a time by city slicker madolyn smith as a rival.i agree with an earlier review regarding scott glenn, he is used for plot only, thrown in to the mix to create suspense; the story is predictable and contrived.also, even though i am from the east, many of us did not like "saturday night fever", while it had its moments, the perpetual stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point.worth seeing for debra winger; she is still so likable, and never had that hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today. 7/10

another entertaining travolta dance flick! great music, mood, and scenes. debra winger is beautiful! like "saturday night fever", this macho film features extremely improbable scenes of beautiful women falling for travolta and almost begging him to have sex with them.

this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis. this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull. if you love a good romance film, then you will love this movie.

how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was, and still is, the best document of texas life for the time period. consider the following: men beat their wives, get drunk at bars nightly, get married to settle a fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly. they dont make them anymore. it seems current films are always about people with lots of money, they live in huge homes, drive expensive cars and don't work. this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete's sake !anyway, i watch it at least once a week. no kidding. i have dissected this movie from end to end. feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. consider the following scenes: bud sees sissy - they are split up - he amicably honks and waves, she flips him the bird - he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off.buds mom calls him approx. 18 hours after he gets into town, on a sunday, to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid(x2), with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him."you all live like pigs" think about why this scene is needed. think about it. was it necessary ? could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ? god i love that !sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull. only a few days (or possibly the next day) after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband. steve asks - hey sissy, remember wes ? oh yeah, didnt you beat my husband up the other night, so let's get this lesson goin', to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy's many fights, which by the way all take place in public - in gilley's !the wedding reception picture taking session (oh the humanity !) could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "my legs are sweatin' momma"in conclusion, you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology. it is a documentary of real life.i only wish there was a director's cut....

i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how corny they may seem today. this movie is a good one. i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever. it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be. now as an adult, i can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time i actually know what's going on. i did find one thing weird. how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissy,get married,move into a trailer,have a falling out,cheat, have an uncle die,then get back together, all in the course of a month? only in america.

what an overlooked 80's soundtrack. i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80s cheese. clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. the best was his lousy texas accent. compare that to friday night lights.i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film. also, as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie. i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it. one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams. just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies.. tom cruise, richard pryor, robin williams and john travolta

this is my favorite all time movie. it used to be my friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when i was single. i first saw this movie with my aunt brend and sister chasity. i was in the 2nd grade. i fell in love with travolta and sissy was my new best friend. i've read a lot of comments about why bud left sissy & how sissy has to "learn to act" married. but let's go back and look at this for a second: spoiler - my interpretation of the movie now, not when i was eight is this about bud & sissy's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at gilley's riding the bull. they get in a huge fight. bud tries to make sissy jealous by asking pam to dance. sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and wes asks her if "she needs any help". they're all on the dance floor acting like fools when bud asks pam, "when are you going to take me home and rape me?" pam answers: "when ever you're ready cowboy". bud then goes home with pam to her condo in downtown houston. which daddy has bought for her with his oil money and "all that that implies". bud is the one who cheats on sissy. sissy is waiting for bud when he returns home the next day. sissy is the one who leaves bud. then, it's up to bud to prove to sissy that he is a real "cowboy" and win her back. anyways, that's my interpretation. everyone has their i'm sure! i love this movie.and believe it or not, i got myself a real cowboy! i love him too! :)

i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out. as a result i don't remember anything about the movie. but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilley's and the mechanical bull to johnny lee's hit song "lookin' for love" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it.however, a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is, i was blown away. few movies have hit me harder. this movie is as raw and real as you can get. from uncle bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in texas city, gilley's dance hall, and bud and sissy. and maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. but no matter how you feel about country music (i for one can't stand it despite my houston roots) urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie. for that reason i love it!

i was about 11 years old i found out i live 0.48 miles from the uncle house. the uncle house is on westway dr, deer park, tx. they have added homes since the movie was made. i don't know the house number but you can go look it up. i am now 21 and i enjoy watching this movie. the bar on spencer is no longer their. pasadena isd wants to build a school their. i drove by the house last week the house still looks great. my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie. where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made 225 higher. when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was 26 or 25 at the time.

does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove? i looks like a mid to late 70's ford. this movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it. i would like to restore the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie. also the music was awesome, and the acting was great. where and what is the lady who portrayed john's aunt? also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? also what year of mustang did debra w drive in this show. it looked like a 60's model. thanks,

this movie has it all, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, pretty girls. this movie is an authenic look at middle america. believe me, i was there in 1980. lots of oil money, lots of women, and lots of honky tonks. too bad they are all gone now. the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie, and that includes american graffiti. it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it. every time i watch it, i am young again, and it is time to go out honky tonking. the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero, i do not feel you should rate one 10.

this movie was a classic. i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes. if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did. it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life, and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a "big throat" and swallow are pride.

while urban cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo, it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age, in urban texas. i also think that to truly critique this movie, one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made. there was good music, fun times and, yes, a few "rough and tumbles" at the honky tonk roadhouses. the relationship of bud and sissy, like "two ships passing in the night", was well conceived. when pam tore up the note that sissy had written to bud, it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances. the entire story was well thought out. i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. i thought the screen play was well written and directed. scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor.

i did not see this film in the theater. i confess to an anti-vinnie barbarino bias. who the hell was john travolta to be making movies? i remember the oscar broadcast that year, with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. how dare he, when there were "real" actors in the running? i'm sorry john, you should have won. after catching this film on cable years ago, i fell in love with the entire movie. bud, sissy, uncle bob, wes, all wonderfully done. i, also, confess to never passing it by when i channel surf. i have to stop and watch. over the years, i've learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs in my waistband, and learned to appreciate travolta more. the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight, on the soundtrack, of some of the music from urban cowboy. "looking for love" defines the film, but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn't make it to the soundtrack. it should have been a double cd........

i must say as a girl with a cowboy of my own,i love this flick.it left me lovin them boots and wranglers even more.i told my friend about it and she loved it just as much,we were 'bout 13 at the time.i think it's the greatest love story ever told!i own it and never get tired of bud & sissy.

very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has. thank god it was temporary. but uc is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you're flipping channels at 3:00am you just can't take your eyes off....my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that's beside the point. i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner, men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers, and if you didnt know how to two-step you were considered a social moron! personally i think it's a great movie. travolta really surprised me on the heels of satnitefever. who'd a thunk. he's actually believable too. the soundtrack is awesome. too bad charlene tilton, of tv's dallas fame ruined johnny lee's career cause that guy was just terrific. the show stealer here is scott glenn as the greaser ex-con redneck cowboy. and i ain't got nothing against greaser ex-con cowboys semi-being one myself, but i've always envied what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time...."pack-at s*#t!" sort of like clint's "make my day." and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i'll see to my julia roberts fantasy so..... like i said, beautiful. 9/10

********spoilers--careful*********what can i say? i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy. i love it and have watched it countless times--and usually find out something new about it with each viewing.i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in either l.a. or new york. well, it is true except for pam.travolta plays bud, a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields. and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys/good guys in big budget movies. this is a really good movie--the mechanical bull riding contest and two-step dancing may be silly, but you have to enjoy this for what it is.bud meets sissy (played by debra winger with slutty brilliance)--and soon after, they are married and living in their dream trailer. but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. bud wants to be a real cowboy. sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. but in modern times, men's roles are not as clear. where can bud prove he's a real man? he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night--he can be a "urban cowboy." but sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. so where does this leave bud? as sissy asserts her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider--, wes (played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn). bud is threatened, and bud and sissy break up.sissy shacks up with wes, who abuses her. emasculating himself further, bud becomes the boy toy of pam, a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies. sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up--pam doesn't do that kind of thing. she writes a make up letter to bud, but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy's housework.bud's uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion. bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation, but are too stubborn. later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley's, and you know bud is going to win. pam realizes that bud doesn't love her, but sissy--he did it for her. wes tries to rob gilleys, but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy, bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.of course, you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and "live like pigs." maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. or why didn't bud stay with pam--she wasn't that bad and had money. or why they had to kill off uncle bob. or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up: marshall says to bud, "she {sissy} rides that bull better than you do!" but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit--and saying, isn't that bonnie raitt on the stage!

i just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. i cannot even count the number of times i've seen it. i was already in love with john travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to gilley's, i was in awe. debra winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. if you're not a country music person, which i wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. if you get a chance, please see this movie-it won't disappoint.

quick and simple, i love this movie.as some others have mentioned, i also, am not from the south, don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat. (i've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either, but i love "goodfellas.") this is just great film making. shot in a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd. (the vhs was 1.33 full screen). and yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. what can you say about this movie?it's just a great love/hate story set in texas, with great performances. travolta is fantastic. next to "pulp fiction", it's the best thing he's done. it's been in my top 5 for 25 years!!check this one out!!! it's a 10 !!!!

i am a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates, i think the sets were representative of the location and the era, i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band. however, i think the photography was amazing! since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings--perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low-level of light that actually was in the bar! what a feat! sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low-light shots. ray villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding! he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film. thanks, ray--great work!

#3 in young john travolta's trilogy of blockbusters. he dances to disco, rock 'n' roll and country. he heads to houston to find work and love. gilley's is the hot spot, and it is the time of the mechanical bull. not to be outdone, i rode the bull at a club in nashville. i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was. i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta. debra winger was in her prime. she looks stunning in her red top. there is plenty of charisma. bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash. they split up just because it feels so good getting back together. urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. we get to hear lyin' eyes by the eagles and lookin' for love by johnny lee.

an unmarried, twenty-something hick (played by john travolta) leaves the farm and goes to houston, where he learns about life and love in a texas honky-tonk. at face value, it's a modern love story ... texas style. there's gobs of cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and references to big belt-buckles and rodeos. the music, if not texas native, is texas adapted, courtesy of the talents of mickey gilley, johnny lee, and the charlie daniels band. and that texas twang ... "y'all".the story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of texas five-alarm chili made with jalapeno peppers. it's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic, one starring laurence olivier or ingrid bergman, maybe. "hamlet" it's not. but "urban cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and i kinda like it.technically, the film is generally good. the dialogue, the production design, and the costumes are all realistic; the editing is skillful. and both the casting and the acting are commendable, if not oscar worthy. i would not have cast travolta in the role he plays, but he does a fine job ... ditto debra winger. barry corbin and brooke alderson, among others, are good too, in support roles. but, the cinematography seemed weak. the film copy i watched was grainy, and at times suffered from a reddish/orange tint, a visual trait i have noticed in other films from the same time period.at first glance, the film does not seem to offer any social or political "message". but i would argue that when "urban cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had rather prophetic implications. in 1980 the u.s. had all kinds of problems, not the least being american hostages held by iran. in the minds of a lot of folks back then, the u.s. was being pushed around, bullied.this film, along with others of its time, offered something that americans wanted to see in their political leaders ... toughness. "urban cowboy" is a very physical film. the characters in it may not be the brightest people on earth. but, they're tough!everything about "urban cowboy" is anti-intellectual. as a vehicle for cultural expression then, this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new get-tough era for the u.s. it started in 1980 with the election of reagan. and that era continues to this day, with a president who probably will not be remembered for his intellect, but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression, traits that americans seem to gravitate to as surely as texans to five-alarm chili.

this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travolta's career. he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. the great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10

i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised. after suffering through "saturday night foolishness" i had no desire to see a re-make in some south texas barnyard....and i didn't. john revolta was good as the jealous redneck, scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con, and debra winger was, as always, a delight. *love that woman* plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music]. a fun film all the way.

for urban cowboy john travolta plays one of the stronger alpha males ever portrayed on the big screen. he's a decent enough young kid who leaves his parent's homestead and strikes out for the big city of dallas where his uncle barry corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry. in 1980 that was beginning to boom and texas was definitely a growing place in the usa.travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig. he meets and marries debra winger who's from the same background, but she's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. and when she beats him at gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's it for him.scott glenn who's an ex-convict is working at gilley's and this film was his breakout role. he's a real snake in urban cowboy, he gets travolta's goat with a mere look and he moves in on winger. travolta in turn takes up with rich girl, madolyn smith osborne who's slumming at gilley's. despite the characters, urban cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the self-styled biggest honky tonk in the world. gilley's is no longer there in the suburban texas community of pasadena, but the memories do live on. and the best thing about urban cowboy is the wonderful score of country/western songs that were featured in the film. i'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for urban cowboy, but it's the only reason i can think of why the motion picture academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. i especially liked johnny lee's looking for love, if it was specifically written for this film, it's a disgrace that it wasn't nominated for best song.i liked debra winger's character best in this film. she doesn't lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up to travolta and does it in style. and this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bull-rider in the professional bull riders.

okay, so i have come a long way from houston by now, but whenever i see this movie, i am taken back to a little cowgirl's dream to one day ride the bull at gilley's. (it burned down before i was of drinking age.)if you grew up in in east texas, then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time. if you didn't then trust me and watch the movie. either you will join the many who love it (and at the same time strangely repulsed), or at the very least, you can make fun of the red-necks. (there is plenty material for poking fun.) this movie doesn't try to be p.c. (what was that in the 80's) or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and place.gotta be a 10 for me!

first let me say i am not from the south but i am an american. i don't love country music but i can stomach it. i would never wear a cowboy hat but i wear hats. i don't live in a trailer but i do eat tuna salad and own a home. what does that have to do with this comment? a lot if you are one of those people who say only "country" people love this movie. this movie is loosely based on the "they loved and lost" premise. james bridges directs an american love story as real as it gets. in an era of jerry springer and "lets put it out there" mentality, this film rings truer than ever. bud is "coming of age" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them. bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford. he quickly meets sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs. (*this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. marriage is a focus here that is often missed. early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man. it also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.)bud is challenged and is excited when micky's puts in an electronic bull. sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start "acting like it." the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they (note this is giving some of the storyline away) split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.how anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me. john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition. he was believable and real. the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar..still gives me goosebumps. mind you i am not a huge travolta fan, but come on, i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film. deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud, after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up. the supporting cast was incredible. wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy. madolyn smith-osborne, as buds mistress/girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the u.s. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film. my biggest kudos's go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as bud's aunt and uncle. they seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role, they made the film so much bigger and lifelike. two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death. the dialog between them is touching.if you can watch this for what it is, a true american love story. then i recommend that you take it for what it is...a film before it's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. lastly, the music however dated, is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.

i attended camp chesapeake. it was located at the head of the chesapeake bay on the north east river in md. it was a similar type summer camp with cabins. it was established by the coatesville, pa ymca. i started out as a young camper and later became a junior, senior counselor and later, the waterfront director. if the camp had continued, i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director. alas the powers of the ymca decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of md. i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of md and natural destruction by mother nature. the 350 acre site served so many with all the benefits of contact with natures offerings. a black man by the name of curtis ford, and his family were residents and caretakers of the property. mr curtis was my friend and mentor. i idolized his every being. even as he could not swim he was a waterman. if i asked him where the fish were biting, he would designate the spot, and i would have a ball. ther was also a family camp at the end of the summer. these memories will be with me for eternity.

this ensemble piece about adults who return to the formulative summer camp of their youth was a very quiet entrant and exiter to the cinemas in the autumn of 1993. i'd say that was a shame,but then again,some of the better movies are quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise.diane lane,kevin pollack,elizabeth perkins,vincent spano,julie warner,bill paxton,kimberly williams,matt craven and alan arkin(who is painfully good here) are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good,bad and funny memories of summers gone past. this film covers the gambit of emotions,mostly pleasant,and the film never hammers away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling,preferring to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own. since i am a movie viewer who bristles at bluntly,brazen manipulation in films,this is something that i appreciate from writer/director mike binder.this film's a great cheap rent,a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick. you might run across this on tv,and i would definitely suggest a look-see.

indian summer! it was very nostalgic for me. i found it funny, heartwarming, and absolutely loved it! anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the "good ole' days" for a brief time really needs to see this one! it starts out as 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a "reunion". i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself. the actors were great, and it contains an all star cast. everyone in it played a terrific role. you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it. alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou. he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives. this is also a good family movie for the most part. i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! highly recommended!

i have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. i was really confused about who was who. for example, bill paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. then, when all the males arrived at camp, it turned out there was a character who looked like bill paxson, but wasn't. i said where's bill paxson? then, there was a guy with his girlfriend. he said she was 21. this was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camp director's (alan arkin) most memorable. later on, this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences. that made no sense. she would have been one years old. that said, the movie turned out to be pretty good. kevin pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased. one guy was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. alan arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth. the best part was that none of the grown-up campers were successes in life. none of them had very great careers. this seemed very real life. the movie was compared to the big chill. in some ways it wasn't as exciting as the big chill, but it was a lot more realistic. so, even though the beginning is not promising, the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one.

i am a sucker for films like this. films that take you back and let you relive your childhood. i'm a grown up now and have many grown up responsibilities like a mortgage, kids, dogs, a wife and a slew of others. i enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and carefree like it was when i was twelve. mike binder's indian summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old. it brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun. it brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues. indian summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh...and reminisce.the film stars kevin pollak, bill paxton, diane lane and matt craven (to name a few) as childhood friends that are being summoned back to camp tamakwa by their former head camp counsellor, uncle lou. uncle lou is played perfectly by alan arkin. he is kind of guy who is the patriarch of the group. he is also all knowing and encompasses the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life. he has a hard time relating to today's kids that need a walkman blaring in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like tamakwa. this is a camp that has moose wandering through the camp, leaves turning colours that god gave them and water for as far as the eye can see. uncle lou yearns for the days of old and asks his former campers back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp. while they are all together again, we get to see their trials and tribulations and perhaps a new love could spring between them.as the adults return to the camp, it isn't long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again. they take toilet paper out of the stalls, the put toothpaste on sleeping bags and so on. all of this is done hilariously and with actors like pollak and paxton, it is all very funny stuff.but beyond the hilarity, we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to. in one of my favourite scenes, kevin pollak and elizabeth perkins are overlooking a bay where they used to go canoing as kids. pollak can't get over how small it all looks and perkins finally tells him that the bay didn't get smaller, they just got bigger. it doesn't hammer the point home, but it does it subtly. we all grow up, we all move on and we all unfortunately can't live like we did 20 years ago. the more things change, the more they stay the same.indian summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by mike binder who actually did attend camp camp tamakwa, (as did sam raimi, who played stick in the film) and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film. there are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also. both are perfect.i love this film. i love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem.10/10

i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel-surfing before going to bed, and really liked what i saw. since then i've been on the lookout, scouring tv listings, flipping through dvd/vhs racks at stores, but didn't find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it. then, being a world-class procrastinator, i still didn't order it. finally, i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland, or, a few weeks ago. then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it.so, what do i think about the film? it's good. not as good as i remembered and hoped for, but still well worth the $9.99 it cost me. after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7/10, with potential to become an 8/10. i'll have to be less sleepy then, and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue.

i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it. i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since. i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film. when i watch it i wish that i could be 10-14 again. i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent. we all at times wish that we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom/knowledge of adults. wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends/parents be young again? to not have to worry about your job, being a parent etc...??? i know that i would like to jump into a de lorean and go back in time. while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is meatballs with bill murray. i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that.

if i could go back, even as an adult and relive the days of my summer's spent at camp...i would be there so fast. the camps i went to weren't even this great. they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing. the movie cinematography was astounding, the characters funny and believable especially perkins, pollack and arkin. sam raimi's character and sub-antics were priceless. so who ever thought this movie was lame...i have deep pity for because they can't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids. the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity. i wish i could. it was funny, intelligent, beautifully scripted, brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even. sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawk...good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors. rent it, see it, buy it and watch it over and over and over...never gets old. ;0)

indian summer is a good film. it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional. how about sam raimi playing the camp buffoon. i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton-like performance. solid directing and nice cinematography.

rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with; this was one of them. it had good acting, dialogue, plot, and the scenery was beautiful. i laughed out loud many times, especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid. the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor, but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick. the story dealt with a group of people in their 30's coming back to a summer camp that they had attended 20 years previously. it was a farewell week of camping, as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season. as adults the camp looked different, and they felt differently about it and each other. i recommend this funny, moving movie to all.

i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it! every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting, the script, the direction, and the general feeling of this movie. it's been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter, reflect from sadness, and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work! we need more movies like this!!! mike binder: are you listening???

a great ensemble cast! a fond remembrance of younger carefree days. this movie takes me back to when i went to summer camp. indian summer, while full of practical jokes and pranks, is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle-age life. my family & i thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp, or wanted to. this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. it is funny, it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role. if you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? get off you butt and run the video store. have a great summer :)

i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years. it really is a fun little film, with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it. arkin shines as always. check it out; you won't be dissappointed. by the way, it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging, it is widescreen. the transfer is rather poor, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)

before tuscan sky, i saw diane lane's tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie. campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost, which makes it so realistic. maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet "this is so camp!" from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends, to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it's amp. once exciting activities now seem mundane. a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one-two dimensional roles and makes them believable. bill paxton, diane, elizabeth, mrs. brad paisley (probably when he first fell for her!!) the beautiful scenery, bright colors, comical music (including variations of hello muddah)and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend.

indian summer is a warm, multi-character film, that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing).the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp, uncle lou. the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and form new memories in their latest stay.the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting, and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. watching these people reminisce, and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. it never goes to over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well, and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself.for a warm, nostalgic character movie, i sincerely recommend.

there is this private campground in plymouth, massachusetts, that's been around since 1959. my grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site starting in 1965, and my two brothers have sites there now.(this doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.) i spent summers at blueberry hill from when i was five years old to when i was eighteen, and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was, as my fiancée tells of me, "the good and happy place." if you've never experienced the lifestyle, indian summer will probably be lost on you; don't bother. it's not quick-paced, it doesn't have rapid cuts, the plots aren't in the least bit convoluted, it has no explosions, such dramatic tension as exists is mild, there aren't any a-list actors, there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than, perhaps, kimberley williams' killer line about how her fiancé shouldn't "overwind his toys." that is not the least degree what this movie is about, any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore.but indian summer is godfather's polar opposite. if you have experienced the lifestyle, see this movie. don't read any more, just do it.for me, this is a 9/10 film.

i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall, but four things really stand out: sam raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy(?)man, alan arkin's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner, and best of all, the cinematography. the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories.the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable. some reviewers criticise the lack of a more "profound" script. to me, it is exactly that lack that makes this film work. the characters and their problems seem real and because of that, i care about what happens to them.the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right.

a quiet, sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you. a movie that makes you feel good. all the ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. mischief, nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps. all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp. all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.

this movie is by far one of my favorites. i saw it while in college in the early 90's, and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film, i felt that the story, characters, and movie in general were top notch. to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer, feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon-type movies and leave the movies with a great, wholesome story to those who can appreciate them.

deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups (bill paxton, julie warner, kevin pollak, elizabeth perkins, vincent spano, matt craven, and diane lane) who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka, a camp in (ontario) canada by their former consuelor (alan arkin). writer/director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. also, the movie has plenty of funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite, the one involves using masking tape. newton thomas sigel ("the usual suspects", "three kings") provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness. among the cast, sam raimi, director of "the evil dead" films and "the gift", appears here as arkin's bumbling right-hand man. one more thing, this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders.

i have watched this movie well over 100-200 times, and i love it each and every time i watched it. yes, it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable. the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is, a great place to spend the summer. everyone who has ever gone to camp, wanted to go to camp, or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids.

this movie is great! this movie is beautiful! finally, a movie that portrays moslems as people, no stereotypes here. this movie is driven by the story, by the acting and above all by its theme, that of cultural affirmation and discovery. they may seem like clichés but they are not, at least not in this movie. the vista of the grand mosque of mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the west. here the people are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and devoted to each other. what a welcomed and way overdue departure from the usual negative portrayals of arabs. outstanding movie.

i've joined imdb so people know what a great film this is! it's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble. you've read the plot so all i want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble ,because that's the typical misconception people read in to,instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. this was one of the very few films to be nominated for a bafta being independent and foreign. the beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. the only thing i wish is for it to be longer and see what happens

le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film, a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film. ferroukhi's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian (a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters) and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys. reda (nicolas cazalé) lives with his muslim family in southern france, a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage. his elderly father (mohamed majd) has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca, and being unable to drive, requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation. the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france, into italy, and on through bulgaria, croatia, slovenia, and turkey to saudi arabia. along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father's demands. on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman (ghina ognianova) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda, a turkish man mustapha (jacky nercessian) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing, and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons. tensions between father and son mount: reda cannot understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps, and the father cannot comprehend reda's insensitivity to the father's religious beliefs and needs. at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip's significance is overwhelming to reda. the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning. it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values. the visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects. nicolas cazalé is a superb actor (be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer's son') and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film. another fine film from the film movement, this is a tender story brilliantly told. highly recommended. grady harp

what starts out as generational conflict in this movie, ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. the movie meanders through europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles. the cramping forces lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to collide. there's really no clear winner. it all adds up in the end as experience, experience of multiple layers of life. for those interested in understanding islam, this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook, without being pushy about the agenda. it's a coming of age story for the young son, his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life.

i won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this film.in my opinion this is an excellent film, not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grown-up son, but also as a little window onto the world of practising islam, for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion.an important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relation to his father's beliefs and practices, and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them.this is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable and well-made film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart.

reda is a young frenchman of moroccan descent. despite his muslim heritage, he is very french in attitudes and values. out of the blue, his father announces that reda will be driving him to the hajj (pilgrimage) to mecca--something that reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation. as a result, from the start, reda is angry but being a traditional muslim man, his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings. both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible--and it's very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn.when i read the summary, it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other. however, i really don't think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film. sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression. i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasn't complete resolution of this--as it would have seemed phony.overall, the film is well acted and fascinating--giving westerners an unusual insight into islam and the hajj. it also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional islam and the secular younger generation. while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some, i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people--not some formula. a nice and unusual film.

this isn't 'bonnie and clyde' or 'thelma and louise' but it is a fine road movie. it sets up its two main characters gently and easily. viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young french (and english) speaking son who wants to do well in france, has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol, parties as young men do. and there is his moroccan arabic (and french) speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith, with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him (like mobile phones). the film could explore very powerful politics - the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia, thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca. these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other. yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas. the relationship between the two is key to this film, and faith, politics are the backdrop. it seems to be saying that we are all human, and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world. it certainly isn't 'natural born killers' and is all the better for it.

i don't know...maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action(hajj)but i just felt the movie is so underrated. i just can't believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then.about the movie...it's one of those well-acted sweet movies.reda,a french teenager due to sit for baccalauréat, is asked by his devout elderly father to take him to mecca.strange as it may seem(if one doesn't know much about islam)the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to saudia arabia on a once-in-a-lifetime religious pilgrimage.the generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms('you may know how to read and write, but you know nothing about life,' the unnamed father to his son)but some sort of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided.bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations.the father never speaks in french though reda understands arabic but can only seem to answer in french. though they encounter many people on the road: "there's the scary old woman they pick up in the bosnian border on the way to belgrade, and the talkative mustafa(jacky nercessian), who helps them out at the border of turkey,the reticent and shy women wearing burqas on the way to damascus" the focus is always on the mismatched father and son.there is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes. you see magnificent views in every city they go.the director shows you even the blue mosque and the hagia sophia even though the movie is not relatively long.generally i don't like movies which don't have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great.despite some unanswered details(like reda's unseen french girlfriend)the movie appeals to senses.great work of art and remember this movie is ismaël ferroukhi's debut.

the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script: an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from france to the haj in mecca, saudi arabia, so that he can fulfill his holy muslim obligation before he dies. the father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion, he'd rather be with his (non-muslim) girlfriend. the father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. however, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in croatia who upon being asked for directions to belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map. in bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in bulgarian. there is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the muslim slaughterman ritual. they eventually make it to mecca - the muslim equivalent of the vatican but on a much grander scale. for westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. the movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of national geographic with soul.

father and son communicate very little. in fact they speak different languages. but when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage's to mecca, the conversations finally take place. they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts.this movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers, and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals. the imagery throughout is impressive, especially the final scenes in mecca. it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be, but also at the same time, how similar. the same was true for the father and son in this film.see this movie. tell your friends to see it. you'll be glad you did.

you'd think you're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia, going through most of europe - italy, bulgaria, croatia, slovenia, turkey, before arriving in the middle east. but this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.reda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the haj. however, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to mecca by car. he can't drive, and therefore enlists the help of reda, to his son's protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle.but reda doesn't see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. and hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals.the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water. through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences.it's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj. the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. don't miss this, and yes, book early - i was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house.

barbara stanwyck plays lily powers. she's a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town. he also sells her to men. she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top.originally i had only seen the 71 minute version but it's pretty extreme--for its time. nowadays it's pretty tame. the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo--some of it comes off as pretty silly (but fun) today. it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen--even in 1933. there's nothing classic or monumental about this--it's just a quick, gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun. it only falls apart at the end with a little "moral" ending that the censors demanded. it comes across as unbelievable and stupid (i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it--one guy quite rightfully said "no way") i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different, somewhat tragic and much better ending. this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! i believe this is the only one in release--but be aware. the acting is good--stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top. she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around. there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent. also look for a pre-stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker! fun, dirty and fast. i give this a 9.

i'd love to give this movie a 10/10, but in its existing state i can only go to 8/10 tops. the post-code editing (read: destroying) of this film warrants a 2-point demerit.from my very limited knowledge of film history, baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in 1934. (i don't know what the other movie was.) as a result, the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934. it was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today. the best that we can see today is the version that tcm (turner classic movies) shows, but that is blatantly edited in several scenes, and has a really disappointing "happy ending" slapped onto the end.all the above being said, the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch. barbara stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful. she is so beautiful and powerful; she just owns the whole movie! she plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life, starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie, pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you don't shut down my speakeasy i'll let you sleep with my daughter'. when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick, the smile on stanwyck's face is priceless.after the fire, stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city. she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top. starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department, she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank. from there, she sleeps with man after man after man (including a very young john wayne) using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper, with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies. stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top. it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder. stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, manipulating, she-vixen in this flick! if you watch this movie, i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character (courtland trenholm) die in stanwyck's arms. skip the remaining 3 minutes or so! the "happy ending" slapped on to the end of the movie for post-code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief: the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr. and mrs. trenholm's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie, with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie - "the end". puh-leeze - how lame! the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt. i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post-code ending.i certainly hope that a print of the original pre-code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime (update: the original has been found and should be out on dvd and/or tcm in 2006!). until then, i'll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame-o post-code ending.

a pre-code stunner with stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top. these pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination. stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy owner/father who sold more than booze to his patrons(johns).after the old man dies(good!) barb heads for the big city for better things.she uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top. john wayne makes a poor "cameo" and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach. i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors. i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as lilly.

in ten words or less to describe this film, barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great! the film is wonderful, except for the perhaps tacked-on ending, but i love happy endings anyway. barbara stanwyck, however, as the platinum-blonde gold-digger is amazing. she knows what she wants and goes after it! this film is sexy and excellent!

this is one of the most daring and important of the so-called "pre-code" films made in hollywood during the 1930s. unlike some pre-code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934-5, this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish. the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film, as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top--and with no apologies along the way. this "broad" both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich--something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later.the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy. in addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. while not especially clear here, it appears as if daddy has been "renting" his daughter's body out for a long time.however, after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull, barbara has had enough and heads to the big city. it doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move.despite the depression, barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another--until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law!!! this all ends in tragedy, but babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men. in fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she's on top (perhaps in more way than one).now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant. barbara played a 100% sociopath--a woman with no morality and no conscience--just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process. however, the brave writers and producer "chickened out" and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending. considering that this woman was so evil and conniving, her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film. in many ways, this reminded me of the ending of jezebel--as once again, a wicked person somehow "sees the light" and changes at the not-too-convincing conclusion.my advice is to try watching red-headed woman and downstairs. red-headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end--the leading lady really is a skunk down deep! in downstairs, a film very much like red-headed woman, the roles are reversed and a man (john gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. both are classics and a bit better than this film.this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra-sleazy hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for cinephiles. also, fans of the duke take note--john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role.

infamous pre-code film, really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced. barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers. when he dies in an accident, she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants. she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. although obviously there's no actual sex shown, the film is quite sleazy. unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free), the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull. stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through. as always, she's fantastic.

director alfred green's melodrama "baby face" with barbara stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the pre-code movies. these films were produced before the production code administration had the power to enforce its rules in 1934. "inspiration" scenarist gene markey and "midnight mary" scribe kathryn scola penned the screenplay, based on mark canfield's story, about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society. incidentally, mark canfield was a pseudonym for producer daryl f. zanuck. these pre-code films today seem tame, but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late 1950s when the code began to erode. the themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men, women versus women, and women versus society. our crafty protagonist does enough skulduggery that all themes are about equal.lily's worthless father nick powers (robert barret of "distant drums") operates an illegal speakeasy bar during prohibition, when the thirteen amendment outlawed liquor, and brews his own booze in a still out back. nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he pimps out her beautiful, but hard-working daughter lily (barbara stanwyck of "night nurse"), but lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician. the politician. ed sipple (arthur hohl of "private detective 62") vows to retaliate for lily's refusal to accommodate him. later, nick chews his rebellious daughter out. lily reproaches him. "yeah, i'm a tramp and who's to blame? my father, a swell start you gave me, nothing but men, dirty, rotten men. and you're lower than any of them." no sooner has she stormed off than nick dies when his still blows up and kills him. lily and her african-american maid chico (theresa harris of "arrowsmith") pack their bags and catch a ride of the first freight leaving town.no sooner have our heroines arrived in new york than lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank. visually, director green shows lily's shrewd ascension up the ladder with camera angles that move upward until lily's sexuality threatens to destroy the bank. at one point, lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer, ned stevens (donald cook of "the public enemy") and his fiancée, anne carter (margaret lindsay of "cavalcade") after stevens had almost fired her for flirting with her boss, brody (douglas dumbrille of "his women") in the employee restroom. lily is extremely shrewd and manages to emerge from each debacle better off than before. the board of trustees hires courtland trenholm (george bent of "jezebel") to take over as president of the bank. the first thing that trenholm does is pay off lily instead of letting her publish her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank. moreover, trenholm ships lily off to their branch bank in paris where lily doesn't create any commotion until trenholm arrives and they become romantically attached. lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away, but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husband.ironically, lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in, but trenholm and she are happy now. "baby face" qualifies as one of the five best pre-code movies. look for john wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene.

this film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the hoyts code was enforced. it's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there.barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance. lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men. stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals, hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns. lily powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money.i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard. i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film. the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain. the filming and different scenes were something fantastic! the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film full of realism.this film was all together an alright movie.the ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been, but it didn't entirely ruin it. baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next. but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once, and suggested to some people and friends.

i enjoyed this movie a lot. i thought that the plot of the movie was realistic and relevant to anytime period in american history. there is always that woman that does what she needs to do to climb the class system. i feel that the character of lilly was portrayed correctly and could of not been done better. what i enjoyed most was when she realized what love really was. throughout the movie all of the men that fell for her were in love with her, had given her everything, even lost their careers for her. until she had met cortland, she did not understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. the way her life had ended up was far from what she expected to be possible. i'd recommend this movie to anyone of a mature audience so you are able to understand the content and the under-laying meaning of the movie and plot.

baby face is a fast paced, wise cracking, knowing smirk of a film thatlasts only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes theyare! that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such ashort time puts most of today's movie makers to shame. screenwriters oftoday should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat thatoverwhelms so many of their films. the story is no nonsense. an amoral woman rises to wealth first under,and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her.sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming, happy ending,but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted togo, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest. stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as ahapless suitor. not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one. ifyou've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cableor rent the cassette. it's worth the effort..

lily powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies.she then goes to new york to work at an office building.there she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want.and what men want is her...well, you know.alfred e.green's baby face (1933) is a movie of high sexual content.for a movie of that era, anyway.this was one of the last pre-code films that were made.barbara stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as lily.other actors of this film include george brent (courtland trenholm), donald cook (ned stevens), alphonse ethier (adolf cragg), henry kolker (j.p.carter), margaret lindsay (ann carter) and theresa harris (chico).the young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy jr.this movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good.baby face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch.

escaping the life of being pimped by her father(..and the speakeasy waitressing)who dies in an explosion, lily powers(barbara stanwyck, who is simply ravishing)sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham. when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law(and lily's new lover), the sky's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands. newly appointed president to the bank, courtland trenholm(george brent), sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love. this makes lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way. though, circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches..trenholm, now her husband, is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank. he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing.stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish. being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy. good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act. obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily's dead heart. that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me. she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him.

first off, if you're planning on watching this, make sure to watch the uncut version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship), it makes a huge difference. this film is about a young woman, played by barbara stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father. when her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own. after reading about nietzsche's philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all. overall, baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera.i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it, especially with the films shock value. i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but i think that about most movies the first time is see them. actually, i think that almost all movies i've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite "flow" right. this was probably just the craft of film-making wasn't quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years. compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and i think you'll see what i mean.once again, i'm very glad i was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference. also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.

very slick, very pre-hays code, and still very sassy. i would highly recommend seeing this movie, even if you are not a fan of stynwyck. she's funny, she's sexy, she's hard-working - and love that perm she gets!barbara stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building. john wayne (in a suit!) plays one of her first conquests. the last three minutes are a letdown, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position.

babyface - notorious barbara stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.we follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.the dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted hollywood production code.look for a cameo by a young john wayne as one of stanwyck's willing victims.part of the forbidden hollywood collection - i watched the extended version- the dvd has both versions plus red-headed woman and waterloo bridge.an interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that stanwyck would play in the era of film noir. b+

this is a hard-boiled warner brothers film starring a very young barbara stanwyck. a consummate master at portraying machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in billy wilder's "double indemnity", stanwyck plays lily powers, the well-worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel-town. she has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father's customers. once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to new york and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank.this would come across as preposterous were it not for stanwyck's blazing work here. with her dead-eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality. one of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh-faced john wayne as of all things, an accountant named jimmy mccoy. the melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a hush-hush job in paris to keep lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury. a tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before stanwyck sears the screen. the film has curious touches like lily's bonding friendship with an african-american woman named chico and the german immigrant who teaches lily about nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.

excellent, pre-code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage. not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power. stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here, ever driving herself and the film forward. not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo. great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female. still, that's life!

in my opinion this has to be one of barbara stanwyck's best performances. she was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue. and i was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. too bad the movie is so short. lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy. her only link to anything is her good friend, chico, played wonderfully by theresa harris. though chico is african american (and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie), and lily is not, they have a special bond. and it is not sexual. just 2 women stuck, or shoved, into a situation beyond their control. after lily's father dies, and she does not know what she will do, she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants. yes, it's immoral, but that's the entire point of this movie. then "they" had to go and ruin the last few minutes. so, up until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a superb film and worth watching. the "lesson" of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then, and i'm sure will be a 100 years from now. women, it's awful what lily does in order to get what she wants, but it works. men, take note.

i hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of "baby face" with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm. what a great movie! in a nutshell lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own father since she was 14! then his still blows up and he's killed leaving lily (stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid chico, played very nicely by theresa harris. lily leaves for the big city ( new york) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. she does this in great style!she seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! one dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! lily barely blinks! stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.then in paris, she falls for courtland, played by george brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. nearly free with chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved court! lily races to find him, but will she be too late? this is pre-code hollywood at its best. stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. this reminded me of "original sin" with angelina jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like baby face any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it. highly recommended! see it!

the pre-release version of 1933's "baby face" would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. mentored by a nietszchean professor, lily powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except lily's childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. the destructive relationship with her father suggests lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. while lily is cynical and obvious in her approach, the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors. perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women.the plot moves fast, and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as lily climbs ever higher. barbara stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles, and she is in top form here. sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. only her african-american confidante, chico, receives lily's affection, trust, and loyalty. in more enlightened times, the fresh natural beauty of theresa harris, who plays chico, would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to harris. however, despite stanwyck's tough demeanor, obvious tactics, and artificial visage, she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men, including douglass dumbrille, donald cook, and a young john wayne.the preferred version of "baby face" is the 76-minute restored cut. the edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts, which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. perhaps darryl zanuck, who wrote the story under an assumed name, intended a lesson by quoting from nietszche, whose views on women were controversial. however, despite alphonse ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life, lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. however, the philosophy is but a distraction. short, fast paced, and entertaining, "baby face" is as contemporary in its morality as "wall street." substitute gordon gecko for nietszche, and lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be "greed is good."

baby face is one of the better of the "forgotten" films before the code. it was shown last night after the 1931 version of waterloo bridge on the turner classic network, so i was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored. stanwyck is living in east st. louis (where she may have known the drunken parents of "myra" - mae clarke - in waterloo bridge). her father is robert barrett. she has lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in the restored dialog) he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old. now she is resident waitress and part-time whore in his speakeasy, her closest friend being chico (theresa harris), the african-american servant who barrett keeps bullying. it is one of the two good points of stanwyck's personality that she keeps standing up to her father about harris, threatening to leave if harris is fired (and since it is the grubby workers like nat pendleton, who enjoy seeing stanwyck serve them, rather than the flavor of the hooch he serves that brings them in, barrett has to obey her).the one guy who comes to the speakeasy regularly whom stanwyck likes is the shoemaker and intellectual adolf cragg (alphonse ethier), who sees great potential in the spirited girl if she will just leave her forsaken home. he is also pushing the philosophy of friedrich nietzche, and the idea of the will to power. more about this later.after she knocks out the local political bigwig (arthur hohl), and has an argument with barrett about this, a still explosion kills barrett, and enables stanwyck to leave her home town. she and harris head to new york city, managing to get free transport by a railroad freight car by sleeping with a brakeman (james murray). they reach new york, and after walking about they see the gotham trust company (established 1873), and the friendly guard tells her where the personnel office is.we slowly watch stanwyck ascend the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but sleazier) than robert morse dared in how to succeed in business without really trying. but morse was a man in a man dominated company. stanwyck knows her sexual allure is her weapon. she goes through john wayne, douglas dumbrille (a section of the film that i always felt was the most shocking - curiously enough - when i watched it), douglas wood, henry kolker, and finally george brent. each ends up falling for her, and either being pushed aside when no longer useful, or destroyed by her. brent, the new president of the bank his grandfather founded, eventually marries her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after brent buys her a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds). brent is indicted. will she stick up for him? spoiler coming up: the one thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings. the original ending had stanwyck boarding a ship for europe abandoning brent to his fate, but realizing she can't do it to him, returning to their apartment house, and finding he's shot himself. she is riding with him to the hospital as it ends. now before the rediscovered footage was found, the film ended with them apparently giving up all their money to the bank to save it, and retiring back to east st. louis, to live happily if poor.neither of these are good endings. stanwyck should continue on her destructive course, with brent the last of her victims. but even without the breen office the script writers (one is darryl zanuck, by the way) saw fit to have her find a moral center. she has none - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). i don't think that a depression audience would have tolerated that type of conclusion.there are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. it was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so stanwyck has her work cut out for her. wood (when she is going to be fired for an indiscretion with him) admits that he did not want her to work. but in 2006, stanwyck would have been finding woman all over the place. in the film there are nasty, catty remarks (obviously some based on jealousy) towards stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her rapid rise. in 2006, she'd be frequently confronting women superiors, and she would find them cutting her off at the legs very quickly. of course, if she finds one or two are lesbians she might try that road but it is doubtful. and she also never seems to meet any men who are gay. they do have gay male executives in business, who wouldn't give a damn about her legs or breasts.then there is her mentor, mr cragg. cragg is remade in the "bowdlerized" version into trying to make her seek a moral center. in reality he pushes nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) the nazis pushed nieztsche - find your way to power and push it. while nieztsche did stress power sometimes, it wasn't the be-all and end-all of his theories. otherwise nobody would read him today in college courses. cragg is obviously self-educated, but only half-educated. in short if somebody who thoroughly studied nieztsche confronted cragg he'd make him look like a half-educated fool. and this is stanwyck's mentor! a good film, and for it's day worth a 10...but seriously flawed.

during 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that lily powers,(barbara stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on lily. as the story progresses, lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president it is great to see a very young john wayne, (jimmy mccoy jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and jimmy did not even get to first base with lily, not even for lunch. a very young george brent, (coutland trenholm) stars along with barbara stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. this is a great film from 1933 which was produced by darryl f. zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen. this film is rather mild compared to what we view on the hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film. enjoy

barbara stanwyck as a real tough cookie, a waitress to the working classes (and prostitute at the hands of her father) who escapes to new york city and uses her feminine wiles to get a filing job, moving on to mortgage and escrow, and later as assistant secretary to the second in command at the bank. dramatic study of a female character unafraid to be unseemly has lost none of its power over the years, with barbara acting up a storm (portraying a woman who learns to be a first-rate actress herself). parlaying a little nietzschean philosophy into her messed up life, this lady crushes out sentiment all right, but she never loses our fascination, our awe. she's a plain-spoken, hard-boiled broad, but she's not a bitch, nor is she a man-eater or woman-hater. this gal is all out for herself, and as we wait for her to eventually learn about real values in life, her journey up and down the ladder of success provides heated, sexy entertainment. john wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye make-up) does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office, though all the supporting players are quite good. *** from ****

this one is considered a key pre-code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story (1946), but also the paranoid sci-fi invasion u.s.a. (1952)!  and features one of barbara stanwyck's best early roles.she's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  george brent, douglass dumbrille, edward van sloan, nat pendleton and john wayne (at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname, derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout) in the former category and, in the latter, robert barrat (as stanwyck's father), donald cook (as her most tragic conquest), alphonse ethier (as her elderly mentor  more on this later), arthur hohl (as a lecherous politician) and henry kolker (as cook's boss and father-in-law, whom stanwyck also seduces). curiously, scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!abetted by crackling i.e. typically hard-boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets, the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small-town heroine by the intellectual ethier (stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no "ball of fire" which, of course, contradicts her later comedy  directed by howard hawks and co-starring gary cooper  of that name!). under ethier's auspices, she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success; the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in sergei eisenstein's october (1927)! sociologically, it's also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid/companion.the first two-thirds of the film are simply terrific; at first, i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly-introduced george brent character while he ignores herbut, just like the others, he's soon under her spell! on second viewing, however, this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused, and that her tenure in paris has softened her (even if she tries to cling to her hard-earned wealth for as long as it's possible).released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection, the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed pre-release version and the tamer theatrical release print. among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 (though it's heard in the accompanying trailer!), while many other scenes have been shortened (i.e. censored for content): the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances; the seduction at the railroad car; the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook; the shooting, followed by a suicide (only shots are heard in the shorter version); stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing (again, only brent appears in the version released to theaters), etc. tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending (the pre-release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche!

the national gallery of art showed the long-thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10, 2005. it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release. the character of the cobbler, a moral goody-goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top. also, the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form. a wonderful film of seduction and power. hopefully, there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities. look for it.

finally, the uncut version of "baby face" surfaces and from what source? the library of congress. the restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better film. we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age. another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior.barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers (notice the moniker), a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top (literally), she still has good in her heart--note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico (the marvelous actress theresa harris) and the old philosopher. and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful, those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her.lily powers fails to understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to ride, that it's easy to lose control. one possible result is death. hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral, and it's a cold lonely location.a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in "baby face" by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man. "baby face" was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany. though it's highly unlikely that the semi-literate hitler understood much about nietzsche, he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings. "baby face" serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche's will to power concept, especially in the final scenes.although "you've got the cutest little baby face." is apropos as a theme for "baby face," an even more telling and applicable melody is w. c. handy's "st. louis blues" played throughout the film, especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes. "st. louis blues" is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. chico is singing a raw, salacious version of "st. louis blues" when lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop.the restored version of "baby face" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release. by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.

"baby face" is a precode melodrama starring a very young barbara stanwyck, an almost unrecognizable george brent, and theresa harris. it's about a girl who goes to the city to make good...or should i say make time. stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy, depressed, filthy erie, pennsylvania. after her father dies, one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there - and not the easy ones - and to take the high road in life. (note that i saw the censored version and not the uncut - this part of the film was redone for the censors.) she and chico (harris) go to new york where lily (nickname: baby face) decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster. in the movie's most famous scene, the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as lily sleeps her way to the top. she finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job. trouble follows, and she's soon involved in a huge scandal.stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets, and she's great at playing the innocent victim. in one scene, she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top. then she asks chico for another case, and that's filled with more jewelry, plus securities. all in a day's work.theresa harris was an interesting talent - she could be played down or glamorous, and was a talented singer and dancer as well. here, she sings or hums the movie's theme, "st. louis woman" throughout. she worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of stanwyck's, her best work being in the precode era. as a bizarre byproduct of the code, blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place.precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore, though they're 70+ years old, seem more modern. even though these films didn't have to have moral endings, baby face learns her lessons - how like life it is after all. there were several endings of this film, all with the same message. the one i saw had an added scene, but apparently, there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors. (there wasn't a code but there were always censors.) at any rate, it's a neat surprise. "baby face" is an important film in movie history - a must see.

an original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the library of congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. according to current reviews that i've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the new york state censors. i have also read that a dvd is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! if we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. note that the released censored version was originally available on laserdisc, which i have seen. stanwyck rules!

no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. here's a few different slants on it from one of those "religious nuts," as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. 1) "baby face" (1933) offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.in this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. at least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. 2) the ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. a sad comment that so many "critics" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. no surprise, i guess.any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. at a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.

arriving by boxcar in new york city, the shrewd young woman with the baby face begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank.barbara stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-code drama. without a shred of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way. a wonderful actress, stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents.appearing quite late in the story, george brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor. douglas dumbrille, donald cook & henry kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims.john wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for stanwyck's affections. this would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen.movie mavens should recognize nat pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and charles sellon & edward van sloan as bank executives - all unbilled.the music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is baby face' (1926) by benny davis & harry akst and st. louis blues' (1914) by w.c. handy.baby face is a prime example of pre-code naughtiness. in its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex, it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the production code in 1934 was meant to eliminate.

this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur, and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river. this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along. it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder. he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge. stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back. as the movie goes along it's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur. it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska. this is one of stewart's better westerns.

the year is 1896.jeff webster (james stewart) doesn't like people.there's only one friend he's got and he's ben tatum (walter brennan), an old sympathetic man.they're driving a cattle herd with them.that would be their key to richness.in skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon (john mcintire) takes the cattle.now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u.s. canadian border to dawson.now they have a group of other people with them, like the ladies ronda castle (ruth roman) and renee vallon (corinne calvet).there the two men get into the gold business.anthony mann's and james stewart's fourth collaboration, the far country (1954) is a fine western, indeed.the acting work is superb.walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart.ruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet's delightful.jay c. flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morris.the great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles.it's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way.there's just the man and his rifle.but also he's vulnerable.

this is such a fantastic movie, a western about a self-concerned man (jimmy stewart) going up to the klondike for gold. on the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska (john mcintire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the states. the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town. ruth roman, for instance, who has come with stewart and his two companions (jay c. flippen and walter brennen, who plays stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up, too. in 1953, jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre, the naked spur. the far country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. like the naked spur, the far country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. the landscape is gorgeous. stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, rear window). i suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. still, stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. and the supporting performances are universally fantastic. in addition to those i've mentioned, the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good. and i ought to single out walter brennen, as well. he seems to have specialized in playing best friends. his relationship with stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. the screenplay is very well written, and mann's direction is impeccable. a masterpiece. 10/10.

the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named jeff webster who takes a cattle drive from wyoming to alaska, via seattle. he hooks up in seattle with his partners ben tatum (walter brennan) and rube morris (jay c. flippen) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north.but first, he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative ronda castle (ruth roman) who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. that's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand.jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon (john mcintire) who runs the town of skagway, alaska. gannon locks jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town. he fines jeff the ownership of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being. in the meantime, jeff agrees to ride point for ronda up to dawson in order to deliver supplies. but this is just a ruse so jeff, ben and rube can slip back into skagway and steal his cattle back. of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of gannon's reach.after avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other skagway men, they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson. jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold. but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with skagway and wants to try his luck up in the klondike, himself. that involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. jeff and ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against gannon and his gang.they look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by gannon's men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save judge gannon from his just due. the ending shootout at night on the muddy dawson street pretty much takes care of that. first jeff kills two of gannon's best gunman (jack elam and robert wilkie). then as ronda comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him, gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in jeff's arms. then jeff kills gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. revenge has spoken.this is another rip-roaring western that's right up there with the naked spur and the man from laramie. why the universal dvd uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses, is beyond me. you'll wind up missing half the glorious alberta cinematography by william daniels. so if you like well-written 50s westerns, then this one's an a-list keeper. 8 out of 10

now, admittedly, i'm no ardent student of the genre. as a matter of fact, i've tended always to shy away from westerns because, in spite of all their critical cachet as america's primal stories (or whatever), they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either "shoot up the injuns," "the big gunfight," or "hey, let's form a posse!" in other words, it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention, that it left precious little room for surprise or originality. (and yes, i have seen at least some of the so-called "greats", and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including stagecoach, rio bravo, my darling clementine, and of course the infamous [but profoundly dull] clint eastwood-sergio leone teamups in the '60s.)but when i saw this movie on tv - as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death - i finally got it: i understood, at least in theory, what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation (aside from just action and thrills). it is the push-pull between lawlessness and order; the american west represented freedom, but also the prospect of the wild, the untamed. respectable folk could get hurt out there. which, of course, meant that perhaps - just perhaps - it wasn't meant for respectable folk, and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty, those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers, and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land. in such an environment, of course, the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free-spirited enough to be out there in the first place (and so reject "society," at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard), and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right. catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is, i believe (after seeing this movie), the highest and truest goal of any western. sadly, it is so often not the case, as the white hats are completely white, the black ones completely black (and let's not even get started talking about the indians, ok) and there is precious little shades of gray in between.not in this one. jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold. he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy, played by walter brennan (perhaps the western cliché character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here, as always) - and no one else. pointedly, they are out for themselves, and while stewart displays his patented charm (come on, we could never really dislike the guy, now could we?), we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered, self-interested character: none of his "gosh" or "oh golly gee" humanism is allowed to come through. or, rather, it has to be earned, by the end of the picture, in the way i described above. he must confront the lawlessness in himself, and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners' starting point on their gold dust trail. this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff, mr. gannon, played by john mcintire in one of the best "bad guy" performances i've ever seen. he comes on with so much charm and humor, and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart, that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he *is* the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in, it does so with double force. further, by establishing a type of breezy (if necessarily guarded) camaraderie between mcintire and stewart, the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are - and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film.i won't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes - see those for yourself (as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery - filmed on location, mind you, not cheap painted stills that the studio made up). what's key here is how much this story focuses upon character, with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static (read: "talky"). definitely one of the greatest performances i've seen from stewart, showing he could play the renegade, the "man's man" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door. if anything, in fact, his "everyman" qualities lend greater strength to his characterization, making him seem less mythic or overblown - -like, say, eastwood or john wayne - and more a three-dimensional personage. his relationship with brennan is well-played: understated, but nevertheless touching (with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from "of mice and men" - an altogether different type of "western").i certainly have more westerns to see, but this is for now my favorite, and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others. it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is.

after losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman, a trail boss winds up in the yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states. while there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling. good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup.

(contains slight spoilers)it's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here. stewart is, of course, remembered by many as george bailey from frank capra's "it's a wonderful life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. in "it's a wonderful life", bailey gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born. in "the far country", stewart's jeff webster, by not getting involved to help anyone else (except himself), gets to see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) doesn't exist.by not getting involved (and by attempting not to care about anyone), webster is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt, pushed around, and even killed while he stands by and does nothing. this reminds the viewer of george bailey watching a world that has turned upside-down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born. both movies end with the same image - a close-up of a ringing bell. stewart, by turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, has, it would seem, earned his "wings".

star pickford and director tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated scottish islanders -- the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success. visions of wind and wave, sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story, they are the story of struggle against hardship.the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan, wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church, there seated with her guest's walking stick in her hand like a scepter, discussing her lover, played by matt moore.see if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble. i tried, but failed.

the silent film the pride of the clan starring mary pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of scotland. in actuality, most of the exterior shots were filmed in marblehead massachusett on marblehead neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the churn and castle rock. my initial interest in the film was because of two factors: 1) the marblehead film location in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother lizzette m. woodfin was hired as a stand-in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the "cliff scene". both women were small (5') in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand-in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the chiefton filming set. i just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs. the film itself (my dvd copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where miss pickford portrays a strong woman characterization. i enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although i am unsure whether one exists as i have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration. a very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action!

my comment would have been added to the release date section, but i couldn't find a place for it. i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the u.s. in feb., 1955. i saw it in a "first run" theater in washington, d.c. in march, 1958. wonder if it was re-released, or some problem? in my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but has some classic characters. john mcintyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt judge/entrepreneur/thief. walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier. and, in my opinion, james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did. i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more, and never tire of seeing parts of it again. the photography and scenery are splendid, and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes.

are highlights of this 1917 feature. the pride of the clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. on an island off the coast of scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "fisher folk." my copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. maurice tourneur directed pickford in this pleasant film. pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. not a great picford film, but still worth seeing. matt moore (pickford was married to his brother, owen moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. leatrice joy is one of the villagers but i couldn't spot her either. my copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. very effective.

cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim. once there, they have to contend with seductive, shifty businesswoman ruth roman and ice-cold, happy-go-lucky villain james mcintire.john wayne may get talked about more, but his good pal stewart made some excellent, hard-edged westerns too, some with the great director anthony mann. frankly, i'd take this, with it's sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama, over north to alaska any day!the far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in widescreen.also, there's some strong support by the always reliable brennan, roman (who's great), the incredibly cute corrine calvet, and james mcintire, who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy, the kind that doesn't take himself too seriously.this would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended mann/stewart northwest-set western, bend of the river.

as i drove from skagway, alaska to dawson city,yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location. jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. when the story moves to dawson, that is when i feel anthony mann, who used the outdoor locations so well, could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, corinne calvet is the nice girl. mann is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in "the naked spur" and the browns in "the man from laramie". like all of the mann-stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of stewart's character which is more complex.

sophmoric this film is. but, it is funny as all get out. it shows the "boys locker room mentality" being played by the "other side". it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are. but that's probably not news to most women, 'cause (just ask one), "they've heard 'em all before".watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. and the other 2.7%...can you ever really please them?

after viewing "whipped" at a distributor's screening at the afm the other night, i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed. the audience was laughing all the way through. unfortunately, every territory was already sold, so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film, but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas. i agree with the comment that "whipped" should not be pitched as a male "sex and the city," mainly because unlike "sex and the city," "whipped" is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously. "whipped" pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies wouldn't dare. also, the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than "swingers," "clerks," and "sex and the city" combined. "whipped" never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy. the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid, which only made the film more impressive considering the budget.

this movie was hysterical. i haven't laughed this hard in a long time. i mean, it's not "good will hunting," but was it supposed to be? i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. amanda peet is hot and awesome. the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did.

a must see! i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious. we're talking nonstop laughs. it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama. amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty, brains, and serious acting ability. peter cohen, the director, has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world. for all of it's comedy, whipped succeeds with it's intelligence. which is so rare for a first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. he is a major talent. judah domke, brian van holt, jonathan abrahams, and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady's men. you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet's web. check out the trailer on whipped.com, it's worth the 3 minute download.

peter m. cohen has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. the critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as "offensive" and "raunchy" only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. it is in the tradition of what i call "reality based" satire following in the footsteps of "in the company of men," "chasing amy", "your friends and neighbors" and "two girls and a guy". cohen's dialogue is hilarious and i was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. brian van holt, zorie barber, and jonathan abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by judah domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (amanda peet). underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products.

i didn't expect much from this, but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film. if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes, this might be a film for you. ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. it's certainly not a momentous work of comedy, but given the low-budget indy genesis this is masterful. to level the playing field for comparison, imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of 100 or so and see what you get! kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through. i look forward to his next effort.

this movie is hilarious! i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again. this movie is not for you movie-goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards (you know who you are.)i won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews."whipped" is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout. it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not your girlfriend. it won't win any awards, but it just has to be watched to be appreciated. true, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. everyone can use some of it sometimes. some people need to lighten up and see "whipped" for what it is, not what it isn't.****1/4 out of *****.

i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time. the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall! this one was definetely fresh and witty. if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings, only a few women have voted! i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score, why? because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to men...it could easily be a "7" rated movie!

a hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this off beat comedy by first time writer/director peter m. cohen. the story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local diner to confer about their dating woes. we meet brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with a quick-wit and sharp tongue; zeek: a cynical, sensitive writer; jonathan: a sexually perplexed nice guy with an affinity for hand creams and masturbation; and eric: the married guy, who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in hope for some enlightenment to his boring and banal married existence. the trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in new york are amusingly expressed, mirroring that of sex in the city and hbo's new comedy the mind of married man, and bring an astute light to scamming. the story takes a twist as the three singletons meet mia--wittily played by amanda peet-and all fall for her. she seduces them each with her uncanny ability to conform to the personalities' they exhibit. when they come to realize they have all met and fallen in love with the same woman, they chose her over their friendship. whipped is a realistic portrayal of the dating world, one that the critic's failed to recognize. in plain language, they missed the point. the protagonist's here are caricatures of real people. the exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and are not to be taken as seriously as the critic's disparagement suggests. see this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.

i had never heard of this film until i came across it by accident when browsing imdb. i saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful expletives on how much it stunk. of course this meant i had to see it. i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie. i watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed hollywood fluff comedies. this is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter (sex and dating) without the usual hollywood fakery. i distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life. if you've never dated or partied much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters. if you have, you'll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion. the ending was also good, as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virginal romantics in contrast to many hollywood movies.

classic drama/action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it's time(1954). the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.unique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertaining.this movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "lawmen" during this particular time and place were very crooked/corrupt much like most developing countries today.the action sequences could have been more realistic though but still,this movie really covers most of the essentials.not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy.......

young beautiful eva (hedy lamarr) marries an older man (zvonimir rogoz). unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her. frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce. then, one day, she's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods. her horse gallops off with her clothes...and she runs after it! she meets young and very handsome adam (aribert mog). they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants.ending spoiler!!!! naturally, since this was made in 1933, she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale. end of ending spoiler!!!!this horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards. lamarr's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude, it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such. there's only a few minor shots of her breasts. also when she has sex with mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release. now today they're back in. this film would get by with a pg-13 easily now.shock episodes aside this is just ok. it is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue. except for the music score this could be a silent picture. luckily all the actors are good--lamarr and mog especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them. also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i've ever seen in a movie. the scenes with the sexual symbolism (there's quite a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. i actually started to giggle during one!so, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, good acting all around--but i wasn't exactly bowled over by it. i found the movie slow-moving (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), somewhat dull, obvious, static and had a negative ending. i can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems i had with it. also the final sequence is really strange--and out of place. so i admire this film more than anything else. it was well-done and i'd recommend it but with caution. many people seem to love this movie so i'm in the minority. use your own judgment.

this picture was banned from american movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by hedy lamarr, (eva hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population. this story concerns a young woman named eva hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. on a hot summer day eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to eva. these two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom. there are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this film to its very end. enjoy a great classic film which was a shocker film in 1933. enjoy.

in 1930,europe received quite a shock when luis bunuel's 'l'age dor' was released, causing a riot in paris when screened there,resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years. three years later,in 1933,when europe had gotten over the shock,it was once again turned on it's ear with 'ekstase',a symphony (of sorts)to love. the film starred a young,unknown german actress named hedwig kiesler,who would later change her name to hedy lamarr,when she moved to america to escape the madness of adolf hitler,as eva,a young bride who has just married a cold,distant loveless husband (played by emil jerman),only to discover that she has made a major mistake. one divorce later,eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day, skinny dipping in a lake,when she discovers adam,a handsome,young engineer (played by aribert mog)who takes a real fancy to her (and she,him). after a wild night of passion,eva's ex-husband turns up once again,hoping to win eva back,only to find he now has a rival. i won't spoil what transpires. czech director, gustav machaty (who directed the original screen version of 'madam x',another parable in romantic obsession) directs from a screenplay by jacques koerpel,frantisek horky & machaty,from the novel by robert horky. the film's velvety cinematography (which reminded me of avant garde photographer,man ray's photos of the era,which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow,a lot)is by hans androschin & jan stallich). the film's brisk editing is by antonin zelenka & the films art direction, which goes for a lush,nearly art deco look,is by bohumil hes). if i have any quirk about this film, it is the music score,by giuseppe becce,which goes for an over the top,melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast (certain themes are repeated over & over again,wearing out it's welcome,fast---kind of like some of david lean's over use of certain musical themes,especially in 'lawrence of arabia',and 'dr.zhivago'). some years back,a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material,cobbled together from various european existing prints available,restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as "decadent" (yeah,right...like the church never did anything wrong),and the hayes office cut it to ribbons,when it was finally released in the u.s.a. in 1936,in a "hayes office" approved cut (likewise). minimal dialog in german with english subtitles (it was meant to be a mainly visual experience). not rated,but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by hedy lamarr (done tastefully,mind you) & some suggestions of sexual content (likewise)that would scarcely earn it a pg-13 rating,nowadays. worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema,or avant garde/experimental cinema

i gather at least a few people watched it on sept.2 on tcm. if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the u.s. it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the u.s. was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible. i watched because i had just seen a documentary on "bad women", actresses in the u.s. pre- movie censorship board set up in the early '30s. it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedy's most "sensational" shots in "ecstasy". in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this, by today's standards, and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty. it was a nice, lyrical movie to relax to. i loved it for what it was: a simple romance. i watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early a.m. i would love to see the first version released in the u.s. for comparison's sake.

i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally. as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema. i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book "film", which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re-read today. my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin, drifters (grierson's magnificent documentary), metropolis, the cabinet of dr caligari, and ecstasy; came first through this book and later at my university art-house cinema. ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican, for condoning eva's desertion of emil, her subsequent divorce, and the brief swim she took in the buff, but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant, outstandingly beautiful, visual paean to love - a view echoed by many imdb users. a very lonely young man, when i saw it, i willingly concurred. no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed. quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial. ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence, against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'the lifeforce'. ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong. disappointed, she returns home and divorces him. soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding. she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience. her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing. but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself. after these exciting climacteric sequences, a bland, predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy, collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy. this story is trite, the acting is no more than adequate; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage, as did most of its contemporaries, long ago. what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography, a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction, coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film. it is sub-titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub-titles, and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward. this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch. the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it. for example, the names - eva and adam; the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery (a bee pollinating a flower, a key entering a lock, a breaking necklace during eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam, etc.); and the final post-suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society, as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on. as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8. for me the film will always remain a "must see", (although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment). unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to hedy kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood (some critics, who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites, hula, back to god's country, bird of paradise or some of the early works of d.w. griffiths and c.b. demille, have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film). this scene was probably part of the original novel, and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it.two further thoughts; firstly this is a czech film, released there in 1933. its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations (i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film - were they removed from the copy i saw then?). secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime. we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience.

this was a very daring film for it's day. it could even be described as soft-core porn for the silent era. it was a talkie, but dialog was extremely limited, and in german. one did not need it anyway.the young (19) hedy lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) german and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.in a famous and funny scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. she is then forced to run across a field chasing after it, as she left her clothing on the horse. an engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.they sit for a while and, in a zen moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. this is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. she knows this man is different.she returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow, and finds the ecstasy she was denied. you can use your imagine here, but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. since he never got undressed, you can imagine... certainly, an homage to women by the director gustav machatý, and a shock to 1933 audiences.the only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending.

eva (hedy lamarr) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not desire her. her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm, leaving her husband. one afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva. they fall in love for each other and become lovers. later, her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home. eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. i have just watched "extase" for the first time, and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. there are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale. the film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. consequently, the characters are badly developed. however, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover. the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear. the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. i liked this movie, but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "êxtase" ("ecstasy")

first, let's get the "hoopla" out of the way.hedy lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen.here we have hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native austrian.i recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic.yes we see a brief close up of hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked, the director gustav machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches.her boyfriend , pierre nay keeps his clothes on at all times.yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes.as other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc.sweet sounding strings run for most of "extase's" length and the film has a "feel" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept.the script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of german spoken by the actors with english subtitles beneath.even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film.put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did eva see in him anyway?money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage.she then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law.after a ride on her horse eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle.however her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate.hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner.and so the romance is born.her husband seeing that his rival must win eva, later decides to shoot himself but i thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with eva.despite being a 1990 reissue title on vhs, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age.after a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after.just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage.this is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title.i gave it 7/10.

the first time i had the window of opportunity to see this all but forgotten classic was back in the early 1980's,at one of our art houses as a revival. as i watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality, i thought yowza! they got away with murder in europe back in the day. unfortunately, this film was heavily cut in it's original u.s. release by the blue nosed hayes office (the staunch government censorship board,started by the "holier than thou" bible thumper, will hayes...a former post office official,if you can believe that),due to it's overall theme of human sexuality (heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's). the plot of ecstasy concerns a young woman (played by hedy lamarr)who marries a much older man,and later regrets it. she (lamarr)meets a handsome younger man & has an affair with him, resulting in a divorce from previous husband (another no no in hollywood movies back then---divorce!). despite the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director's first time working in the sound format (i.e. the film seems to possess techniques that were used mostly in silent films---i.e. 1920's expressionism's). it's still worth searching out for a window into early european talking pictures,along with luis bunuels l'age dor (1930),and karl gustav dryer's 'vampyre' (1931). not rated,but contains that infamous nude swimming scene & some thinly veiled sexual references, which would fare little more than a pg-13 by today's standards (but would have easily landed the dreaded 'x',back in the 30's,if it existed then)

dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. this is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in german, and highly simplified german at that. perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience, as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. the story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer, vertov, and riefenstahl. if the film has any message to convey, i think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. and, oh yeah, hedy does get her kit off.

a good film with--for its time--an intense, sprawling, rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john ford's "the searchers" though not so brutal. the story starts fast and doesn't let up, with several scenes of really good dialog between (stewart's) jeff webster, ronda castle and sheriff gannon. this film is in some ways reminiscent of "bend of the river" (1952), also a mann-stewart work, but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting. there are a few caveats: a too-quickly wrapped up (and rather sentimental) ending; 24-year-old corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager, and of course the film takes place in the mythic west, a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply. but these are trivial concerns. james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beat. a fine western costume drama.

(no need to recap the plot, since others have done so already.)it's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film, raised as we are with the slam-bang sensurround of today's cineplex experience. against that background, a movie like ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet. i think there are several worthwhile reasons why.most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc., providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold. together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology-driven cinema, where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it. additionally, the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening. this amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. but perhaps most unsettling-- the movie is sometimes eerily quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be. but in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer. the former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about those visuals, since they're not going to be explained.none of this is intended to belittle today's film-making. it's simply to point out that a movie like machaty's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today. i don't claim either to be any better or worse. however, i do claim that ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's movie-going experience, where such 'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring. the film itself is no masterpiece, though at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed beer-garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below. the slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature, and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed. these are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you, but instead-- given half-a chance-- accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine-tingling variety of a "jaws". on the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy-handed, as when machaty piles on the imagery, particularly in the final, ode-to-labor sequence. it's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence. perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love-lorn hero and people in general-- a theme then being promoted by the influential soviet cinema. still, its presence here is rather tediously over-done.anyhow, i've got to admit that i tuned in initially to see the gorgeous hedy lamarr in the buff. but now i have to admit that in the process i also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods.

the alternate title of ecstasy, is symphony of love; a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film. ecstasy is an early talkie, and could have very well been a classic film, if released during the silent film era. this film is a visual treat, and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality, which is presented in an artistic low-key fashion. the director's style is distinctly european. the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated, than what was being produced in hollywood, at that time. consider the censorship code in the us, during the 30's, that pretty much sums it up. hedy lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a perfect choice for this 'symphony of love.'

famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity, but it's oh so much more. in fact, this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry, up there with some of the seminal works of 1930s art cinema, in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris, tabu, olympia, and even l'atalante. it's nearly a silent, relying mostly on its miraculous images, and also its fantastic, symphonic score by giuseppe becce. it's a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also of editing, direction, writing, and acting. a good 90% of the film moves along perfectly. machatý seems an expert at using motifs. perhaps not as subtle as it could be, and perhaps a bit overused, but the appearances of objects like insects, lights, and horses carry the story forward beautifully. the small snatches of dialogue are, thankfully, unintrusive. they don't jar as much as one would imagine. the final bit is odd, to say the least. reminiscent of russian silents, we have a montage of workers. this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative, but it's so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw. ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery. it belongs amongst the best films ever made.

this film could have been a silent movie; it certainly has the feel of one. i was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film. extase, is a 'symphony of love', and transcends all language versions. french, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version.a young hedy lamarr lights up the screen, in this film which, in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic.tech qualities may have been a little crude; but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes.many lovers of early cinema, would absolutely adore this film.

ecstasy (1933) (usa 1940) starring hedy lamarr (as hedy kiesler)the world's first glimpse of a 19 year-old hedy lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. this was to be the start of a legendary career. this was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.it is eva's (lamarr) wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. she retreats to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. the husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. gustav machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. with no words spoken in the early part of the film, she is able to grasp our sympathy, our hearts and our support. it is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... some thought it to be scandalous.she returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. the next day, she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. she just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. and in one of the most famous scenes in film history, hedy lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. her frolic in the woods and her skinny-dipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. but the audiences couldn't stay away. as with many of today's movies, the controversy made it a must-see film.eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. after an awkward meeting, they eventually fall for each other. their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. however, machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. machaty creates one delightful moment, when eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a gorgeous early camera trick.it cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on lamarr's part. many might have presumed it was career suicide. instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye louis b mayer, who signed her to a contract with mgm. there are some truly erotic moments in this film, even by today's raunchy standards. it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. again, machaty was very clever with his imagery, leaving a lot to the imagination. but we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.the meeting of eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. however, the consequences of that meeting are not. the film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for hedy lamarr.i highly recommend this once controversial, now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on dvd. it is easily worthwhile, if only for the pleasure of seeing hedy lamarr. but the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.www.tccandler.com - tc candler's movie reviews!!!

another very good mann flick thanks to the father/son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart. brennan (ben tatum) is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne (red river/ rio bravo). he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend. "you're wrong mr. dunston". jeff webster(stewart) gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan. john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it. another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people. the loner can do neither and suffers for it.the caption above plays on tatum's assertion that he can't live without his coffee. this nicotine addiction proves fatal. probably the first and last time on the screen.i recommend this film and now own the dvd.

anthony mann's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre. he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart - in mann's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience. in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance. here it is a "i trust only myself" attitude, which leads to one complication after another. even before the film properly begins he (as jeff webster) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute (we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive, or they tried to steal the cattle). he meets his match in skagway, the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson. skagway's boss is a so-called law man named gannon (john mcintyre) who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the "gold rush" jefferson "soapy" smith and judge roy bean. the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money. stewart's herd interrupted a public hanging - so (as a penalty fine) the herd is confiscated (to be sold later for gannon's profit). stewart is partner with ben (walter brennan - who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean). they are also joined by rube morris (jay c. flippen) and also meet two women, the sophisticated rhonda castle (ruth roman) and the friendly and helpful renee vallon (corinne calvert). rhonda works closely with gannon, but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle. however, she has a similar "i only trust myself" attitude to jeff. she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson. he, ben, and rube go but at night (while the others are asleep) they go back and steal back their cattle. renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following. jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border, although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him.the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson, jeff opting for a longer and safer route. after he is proved right, they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields. the herd is sold to rhonda, and jeff, ben, rube, and renee start prospecting. there is soon two groups in the town of dawson. one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town. but the mounties won't be setting up a station in dawson for months. the other, centering around the "dancehall" run by rhonda, are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers (robert j. wilke - really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c. flippen, jack elam, and harry morgan). jeff wishes to steer clear of both, and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah. but will they get there? and will jeff remain neutral?the performances are dandy here, including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers, but would otherwise be peaceful enough. brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers, whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results. flippen is a drunk at first, but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart's own words against him. mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond, but his work in mann's films show his abilities as a villain (such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73). he is, as is said elsewhere on this thread, really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor. roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being, whose fate is determined by her better feelings. and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier "gigi" aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman.best of all is the canadian rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford. mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film, and the viewer will appreciate the results.

this is mostly a story about the growing relationship between jeff webster(jimmy stewart) and ronda castle(ruth roman). she takes an instant liking to jeff in a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities seek him on a charge of murder. they find out they have some things in common besides an animal attraction. neither trusts a member of the opposite sex, apparently because both have been married to spouses who cheated on them. gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from skagway to dawson. but ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt sheriff gannon and engages in some shady practices in her castle saloon in skagway. she eventually has to decide between gannon and jeff. meanwhile, rene, a young naive french woman also takes an immediate liking to jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. yet, she sticks with him in his travels from skagway to dawson and his activities around dawson. along with ronda, she nurses him back to health after jeff is left for dead by gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim. walter brennan, as ben, serves as jeff's long time sidekick. he doesn't have a meaty role, but serves to soften jeff's hard edges. his demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for jeff.john mcintire(as sheriff gannon) makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. evidently, he sees something of himself in jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him. he makes a believable incarnation of the infamous soapy smith, who spent his last years in skagway, as one of the premier con men of his times.jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion ben), who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. in this respect, he closely resemble's burt lancaster's character in "vera cruz", for example. thus, jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of dawson, he is convinced to leave dawson after gannon's gang move in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal gold claims, while disposing of some miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from dawson. even ronda suggests that she and jeff make a hurried exit from dawson while they are still alive. then, jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing desire for revenge for the shooting of ben and himself. he changes from anti-hero to hero in leading the expulsion of gannon's gang from dawson. in this respect, he differs from lancaster's character, who never reforms(but is jeff truly changed, or just handing out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests?)the main problem i see with the plot is the 2 principle women. clearly, ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame jeff. although she is clearly characterized as a "bad" girl, jeff has a checkered recent past himself, having shot at least 5 men in the us or yukon, and having stolen his cattle back from gannon. ironically, soon after jeff changes from anti-hero to hero, rhonda makes a similar change in running into the street to warn jeff of gannon's impending ambush. she dies as a result and jeff asks her why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just abandoned creed!).it's clear that corine calvert, as renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead ronda, in jeff's mind. yet, the apparent implication of the parting scene is that they get together, even though jeff never visibly gives her a kiss or hug. her image as a good, if naive, young woman is somewhat compromised by her job in rhonda's saloon of bumping miners weighting their gold dust, pushing the spilled dust on the floor and recovering it later. i'm also very unclear about her relationship with rube morris, a middle aged miner who followers her around and works a claim with her.(he's not her father).another problem is the amateurish handling of the gun fight between jeff and gannon's gang. if gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he should have killed or seriously wounded jeff under that boardwalk, before jeff did the same to him. and how did jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? i also wonder what jeff and friends did to help save the avalanche victims. they were much too far away to pull them out alive from under the snow. and why weren't most of ronda's pack horses and mules also buried by the avalanche?you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon's gang. the sequences shot in the canadian rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. all-in-all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end. no doubt, this film takes some great liberties with history and geography, especially, the part taking place in the canadian yukon, which was in fact much tamer than the us skagway.

the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart (excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. this time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order. stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims...while it's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem. for most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and mcintire, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him. in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature, there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.as usual with mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan, harry morgan and ruth roman (though corinne calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating). sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.

colorful western.wyoming cowboy james stewart moseys on up to the yukon territory to dig for gold, sell his steers, and try to get a date with pretty saloon-owner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants stewart's cattle. beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniels. good technicolor adventure from universal-international, directed by anthony mann.also starring corinne calvet, connie gilchrist, and walter brennan as stewart's sidekick.

(spoilers in first paragraph) this movie's anti-german sentiment seems painfully dated now, but it's a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. it was made back when cecil b. demille was still a great director. (ignore all his later best picture academy awards; he never made a very good sound film.) this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickford's other films, and really it was demille's movie, not pickford's. the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way "the patriot" of 2000 did the same to the british. the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim. they even had pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine. so what'll get the americans more stirred up to war? the sinking of the lusitania, or watching america's favorite canadian import sinking in it? all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in "jurassic park" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part-german ancestry. was it a good film? aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking they're untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained. you'll find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkin's false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda. it made me wonder: what became of cecil b. demille? somewhere between the advent of sound and "the greatest show on earth" he seemed to lose his ambition. ben hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. in a sentence, this movie is for 1) film historians, 2) silent film buffs, 3) mary pickford fans, or 4) demille fans, if such a person exists.

mary pickford ("born on the fourth of july" as angela moore) is "the little american" (of french heritage); she falls in love with jack holt (as karl von austreim), who had moved to america with his german father and american mother. french-american raymond hatton (as count jules de destin of the "fighting destins") has fallen in love with ms. pickford. the love triangled threesome eventually wind up in france, with the great war (world war i, in hindsight) complicating their lives considerably.a mostly entertaining, if propagandistically flawed, cecil b. demille film. the torpedoing, and sinking, of a ship carrying pickford is "titanic"-like. the war intrigue gets dramatic as pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for france, while the germans occupy her ancestral home. of course, german lover holt arrives. it was difficult to believe they took so long to recognize each other as he moved in for the rape, but it was dark; and, prior events had them believe each other dead. the film goes way over-the-top in its symbolism. pickford was, by the way, canadian - though, few could deny she wasn't a "little american", for all intents and purposes.fun to spot "extras" who later became major stars include wallace beery, colleen moore, and ramon novarro - especially, watch for mr. novarro exhibiting "star" quality during one of the film's more memorable sequences: pickford and the wounded soldier saluting each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher. novarro even gets mary pickford to write a letter for him; obviously, he's got a future in pictures. also future-bound is ben alexander, who plays the boy "bobby"; he becomes a dependable child actor, and grows up to become a jack webb partner on "dragnet". ******* the little american (7/12/17) cecil b. demille ~ mary pickford, jack holt, raymond hatton

when the us entered world war i, the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films. the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford.pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: jack holt (german) and raymond hatton (french), but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist.when the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans (think lusitania) because it is carrying munitions, pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander. later on, of course, she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château.director cecil b. demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed-out village. they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing. against the wall is a very large crucifix. as they stand and watch, the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains, suspended in mid air. it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy.pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-waving histrionics many other actors of the day used. she's also very very pretty. holt is very good here in a leading-man role. hatton is ok. among the list of name actors in "extra" parts are wallace beery, ramon novarro, colleen moore, ben alexander, hobart bosworth, norman kerry, walter long, james neill, and edythe chapman.not a great film, but interesting to see us propaganda at work.

this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and james stewart to the screen. "the far country" is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked. stewart, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns. jeff webster (stewart) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, ben tatum, played by walter brennan, since tatum is the one that gave it to him. mann, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns. he displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. the story is that jeff and ben, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson, along with gold partners calvet and flippen, and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men. they are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff mr. gannon (mcintire) and his "deputies" will hang them, since the only way out is through skagway, which is gannon's town. but, eventually, mcintire comes to them, but not to collect stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. what is mcintire there for? he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. people are killed. a sheriff for dawson is considered needed, and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun. stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. he also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. so, flippen is elected instead. a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named madden, who carries two guns, played by wilke. flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. a man named yukon replaces flippen. stewart and tatum start to pull out, but are ambushed by gannon's men. tatum is killed, and stewart is wounded. stewart finally realizes that he must do something, or gannon will take over dawson, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like skagway. the audience also realizes what stewart must do. another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon. if stewart leaves, gannon would take over the town. if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. this is where a great scene occurs. stewart walks into his cabin. he has a sling on his arm. for a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, stewart is in the background, just inside the door. he stares at it for a few seconds. he tosses the sling away. the sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. this is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. he comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help. what ends the film is a guns-blazing, furious show of good against evil, and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright.

cunningly interesting western from a director who had few peers in the genre. much like other anthony mann pictures, the far country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. both of which play out amongst some of mann's peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death! the story sees fortune hunting partners jeff webster {james stewart} and ben tatum {walter brennan} travel to oregon territory with a herd of cattle. aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a klondike town. arriving in skagway they find self-appointed judge mr. gannon {john mcintire} ready to meet out justice to webster on account of webster having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. in punishment gannon takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the canadian border to dawson-with gannon and his men in hot pursuit. here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.interesting from start to finish, the far country benefits greatly from james stewart's bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and mann's slick direction of the tight borden chase script. the cinematography from william h. daniels is superlative, tho not done any favours by current dvd prints, and the film has a few surprises and a "will he wont he?" core reeling the viewers in. paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans, it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful, yet dark, western world of anthony mann and james stewart. 8/10

jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best.the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rockies that serve as a backdrop for the story. some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast. no exception here, right down to parts that might only have a few lines, the characters are firmly etched with those lines.stewart is a cynical hard-bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan. it's brennan's death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold settlement from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process.john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an under-appreciated actor with a vast range. he could play delightful old codgers, authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and crafty villain. one of the best westerns ever.

stewart is a wyoming cattleman who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in utah ranch his only real companion is his sidekick ben tatum, the great walter brennan to accomplish that, they drive the cattle clear to alaska and on to dawson, in canadian territory, where they sell them...along the way they meet the man who runs the gold-crazy town behind a dishonest lawman john mcintire... he attempts to steal them the herd... later, in dawson, mcintire and his gang reappear, this time interfering with stewart's gold claim... captured by mann's camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian rockies, stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the treacherous actions of a corrupt entrepreneur robbing local miners of their claimsin this entertaining, beautiful western, stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with: ruth roman, a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman resisting the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more docile, the french canadian girl corinne calvet who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment... in spontaneous manner, stewart is lost between the ostentatious saloon owner and the wife-candidate...

the story of peace-loving farmers and townspeople fighting for land, water, law and order, and the respect and ultimate subjugation of the long entrenched cattle interests and their hired guns had been worked over better in earlier (shane) and probably later films as well. there's some good action scenes and the general layout of the story, excluding a disappointing ending, is well executed. law and order and religion have established roots in the town, but the old order of cattle drives, cowboys, and gunslingers is still around as well. the clash of the two occurs in a nicely staged ambush scene where the townsmen ride right into a trap. granger, an ex-gunfighter, plays the guy who is shunned by the very townspeople who need his expertise with a gun.

this would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for john abraham. this guy is an awful actor. be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. he stinks. it seemed like at some point priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.he's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an absolutely hilarious movie otherwise. best comedy to come along in bollywood since hungama, imo. like hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,akshay kumar. this is probably his best performance to date. he better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. ak's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. the body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. it's a genius performance. the packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and i don't think i've ever seen such an atmosphere for a bollywood movie here in usa.garam masala doesn't have one "lead" heroine. it stars 3 incredibly hot+beautiful girls who i thought did a fairly good job. pretty sure they are all making their debuts. paresh rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. rajpal yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). rimi sen has nothing to do.overall, definitely worth a dekho. i'd say it's funnier than no entry, and that's saying a lot. could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than john abraham.8/10

this move was friggin hilarious!!! funniest i've seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chicks are hot too. the story is awesome, lots of great jokes, and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot. to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron. don't rate movies u don't understand. what did u watch, the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation? thats what i thought jackass. akshay kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility, he can do not only action but comedy as well, and is excellent at it. john has proved himself as well, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it.

these are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking, it's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so. i was really surprised with john abraham's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face,so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully,by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar. i was also quite surprised with the akshaye's 3 girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about akshaye's dissapearence(to the other girls) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing ,also majority of songs are good,it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood.

now i really liked this movie, it was so funny.both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors, i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future.akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time, but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch, he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future, john abraham plays his best friend, he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor. i just love john, neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well.the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone.

okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch . it's about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac ( akshay kumar ) starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious . sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely . but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses . there's garam masala at every step of the movie , songs rock but somethings lacking . the comedy's not up to the mark and deserves an award . its nice but not all that excellent . some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn't deserve that many laughs . but of course everyone's opinion is different . so if you wanna watch the movie you're welcome to do so .

garam masala is one of the funniest film i've seen in ages. akshay kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. john abraham is amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. paresh rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. the director priyadarshan has delivered great movies in the past. hera pheri, hungama and hulchul being some of the best. garam masala is his funniest film he has made. the three newcomer actresses are average. rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. i was impressed to see how priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. all 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. packed with loads of laughs, this is one non stop entertainer.

one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens. a remake of priyadarshans 80s malayalam hit boeing boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s hollywoon hit of the same name, garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi cinema.akshay kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy. he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham. however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion.the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles.a must watch comedy. leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs!!!! after all laughter is the best medicine ! ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar !!!!!

on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up. i don't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that haven't watched it yet but i will say that paresh rawal does not have an extensive role such as past priyadarshan movies, for example, hera pheri and hungama. paresh rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him, john abraham does equally well, akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from waqt and almost all his movies after andaaz. even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly nargis who is very good looking and hot. i would say that if you liked hungama or hera pheri this movie is a must watch.

this movie was a fantastic comedy. it had a lot of comedians star in it like akshay kumar,rajpal yadav,paresh raval and john abraham.rimi sen was good at playing akshay kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. mr hot as mac (akshay kumar) and mr cool as sam (john abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl maggie (neha dupia). when john abraham cheats on his work he becomes akshay kumars senior and akshay kumar gets really jealous because his flat has to be given to john abraham and neha dupia starts liking john more. akshay kumar wants to be better than john abraham so he finds a flat and he is going out with three different girls (nitu chandra,nargis bagheri,daisy boppana).

really, i liked it. the premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and here's my favorite part. mary and valerie aren't bitter! they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (a prime example is susan dey, "the partridge family"). in fact, valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie, and then mary said the same thing later, so i would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one.

this movie pretty much surprised me. i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong. mary & rhoda was very funny and well written. they didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie. overall it was very entertaining.my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and i think i might agree with her.

mary tyler moore and valerie harper still can turn the world on with their smiles. the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination reunion/newstart movie work. watch it and look forward to hitting sixty! mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm. a touch of drama adds 2000 realism. a tv series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see lou grant, phyllis, sue ann, murray, and georgette!

so mary and rhoda have aged--who hasn't? i was a teen when mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. yes, it was great to see mary and rho together, and yes, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute. example: the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people." isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day hollywood tv and film "bean counters?" this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best--but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s.

i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it. i wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since aunt bee! they are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the "mtm" or "rhoda" shows from the 1970's. i'd have thought that since it was set in new york city (where "rhoda" had been set) that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared, assuming of course she was still in the big apple.it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows. by the way, what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion, or an eventual series? wasn't that the network that carried the "mtm" and "rhoda" shows?

alright, i have to admit that i have never seen "rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "the mary tyler moore show." even though i don't know anything about this duo of comedic talent, i still liked this movie a lot.mary goes back to work. rose tries her luck at being a comedian. rhoda struggles with a photography career. and meredith...what exactly does she do again? these three stories that we follow over two hours are amusing and entertaining in their own way. when the two long time friends reunite, it only makes the film better. i was surprised about how good the writing was. the little jokes thrown in by mary and rhoda were funny. the script itself was very well put together.i had seen moore and harper in other movies over the past few years and thought that they were very good. but i had no idea that they worked this well as a team. while both actresses do their share to fulfill the title of this movie, they never seem to let me down. (during the run of this movie.) joie lenz and marisa ryan play their roles okay but nothing great. the rest of the cast like jonah, cecile and....everybody else also works well together.being that this is a reunion, you would expect for a fan of either show to enjoy this. from a non-fan i still enjoyed this little get-together. good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this film very good. (the newer version of the mtm theme song doesn't hurt either.)

this movie needs to be put on dvd. it was so funny and i loved it. really, really cute and funny. not realistic, but not suppose to be. the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. it represents the time period way of thinking though. i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players. it is sadly an over looked classic film! believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. she is funny and charming. she stole the show!

penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france, italy, and switzerland meet called lampidorra. it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography. an american multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can take title. his nearest heir is donlan.but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do? especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling.enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze. with a few bumps in the road, schmeeze solves all the problems both financial, geopolitical, and romantic between donlan and bogarde.how does schmeeze work, well that's the gimmick to the whole film. but here's a hint. in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency.anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy. yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond. dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb, way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had.this film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on tcm. but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.

cute idea... salesgirl linda smith (yolande donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra. that country, which wasn't even in north america, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. at one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although yolande donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. there are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig, cheese vendor. bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by qe ii. craig and "the new princess" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra's financial problems worsen... fun little farce....along the lines of marx brothers film. also note that donlan later married val guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the uk & the us.

i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties) has had such a poor reception more recently. in my opinion it has been greatly underrated - but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to (for example) the american: maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more, since we are closer to some of them in real life! particular mention should be made of the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "it's a fine, fine night", which was issued separately on an hmv 78rpm record (10 inch plum label, i think!) in the fifties. i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance: you may have a pleasant surprise.

it's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it. abhay and ritika (played by fardeen khan & esha deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins its process of being arranged. within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs. as they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms.if you've seen honeymoon private limited and/or salaam-e-ishq, then you've seen this film. the plot twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film. everything is predictable. i only enjoyed it because i had seen 'darling' (also starring the leads deol & khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so i said "why not" when my sister suggested we rent 'just married' as well.see it: because kirron kher co-stars and is her usual darling self in it.skip it: because you've had enough of all this couple-fest nonsense! c+

as a westerner watching another culture's view and tradition of marriag, i found just married mesmerizing and delightful. the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. yet this is the case in this hindi film. told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. as said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. there's song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.

i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage. it is very clean you can see it with family. very nicely done. songs are ok too. i think the writer director is great. the movie shows how marriages progress thru time. they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story. some of the dialogs are quite good. the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization. also shows perfect is after all not so perfect. shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. the movie is very well written and directed.

i was waiting to see this movie from a long time. it's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it, i really find it was quite well made. most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life. this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon. the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. the editing and direction were also good, meghna gulzar really did a good job here. to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.

unlike some comments, mine is positive. this movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you don't. a few are related--mother, daughter, son. their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type of life--much like real life. some story lines do not evolve, they just happen. but like true families and good friends, they stick together. the wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes! you are happy for the ending. poor delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together. this does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month. overall, this is a good story and a great movie!!

while this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema, it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family. the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place.the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named, "the hungry bachelors club". jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open. bill nunn plays a cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover. fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always. micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney. the ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life. this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family.

it's great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot. also loved hearing her sing. nice change to see her out of her csi/west wing/er roles. the movie itself was entertaining, but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts. several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why. each character was quirky though and in some cases, i couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. this movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them.

i may be biased, i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club, self-published in 1994. the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, fred dresch, who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film. i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer, i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment. but jorja fox, who plays delmar youngblood, my character, is stellar. she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form. i couldn't have done better myself! this looks like real people, hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home, gracefully and heartfelt.

gabe ryan (frankie thomas) gets out of reform school and goes back to the slums. his sister (ann sheridan) does her best to keep him out of trouble, but it just seems to follow him. aside from his associations with the termite gang, gabe is followed by real-life gangsters who have a scheme to set fire to random buildings to collect the insurance. they need someone to blame for the arson, and gabe is it. it is up to the termites to work the law in their favor and give the gangsters their just desserts.the the scene that introduces the dead end kids is really quite good. the boys wander on over to the new resident's furniture on the street, and proceed to make it their own. they talk to each other in phoney posh accents and talk about drinking tea together; bernard punsley takes a nap in a chair. the boys then proceed to start a fight with the new boy, but after he proves himself a good fighter, they ask him to join their club.the initiation scene is rather good too, filled with mischief that seems dangerous at first, but is really rather clever and innocent.later, when billy halop studies to become the boy mayor, he has a dream about schoolwork. this is wonderfully staged, with tiny holograms of the kids walking on his face and firing questions at him.angels wash their faces is a great title because it plays off of the success of angels with dirty faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. notorious for bad behavior on and off the set, these boys make nice in this film. but rather than seem disingenuous, it makes for some great laughs. this is a preview of what many of the boys would become in the bowery boys series. we even get a few garbled words from leo gorcey.

this 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better michael curtiz's film "angels with dirty faces". as directed by ray enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in america's inner cities today.the film is only worth seeing because of the presence of ann sheridan and ronald reagan, who showed they were well paired together. the dead end kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.in a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in new york. it was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. in today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. the young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. how times change!

the film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'gabe', who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole. gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon gabe meets up with the dead end kids. the kids in this film are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than they'd been in other previous films and down deep, they are well-meaning punks. however, in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see gabe as a convenient scapegoat--after all, he'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed. so, when gabe is about ready to be sent back to "the big house", it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks.the "dead end kids" appeared in several warner brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (particularly angels with dirty faces). however, after the boys' contracts expired, they went on to monogram studios and the films, to put it charitably, were very weak and formulaic--with huntz hall and leo gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed "the bowery boys". because angels wash their faces had the excellent writing and production values and hall and gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera, it's a pretty good film--and almost earns a score of 7 (it's real close). in fact, while this isn't a great film aesthetically, it's sure a lot of fun to watch, so i will give it a 7! sure, it was a tad hokey-particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and reagan ignores the bill of rights--but it was also quite entertaining. the dead end kids are doing their best performances and ronald reagan and ann sheridan provided excellent support. sure, this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming--so if you can suspend disbelief, it works well.

i don't have much to add to what has been said before, but it's very much a film of it's time, and the first (and likely only) time that the studio hung the film totally on the dead end kids.the warner's gave the boys plenty of help, from director ray enright and an 'a' budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. at every turn, we get one of those gem performances from real pros. they are too many to list, but it seems like just about everybody on the warner's lot (sans the very biggest stars) walk through this picture. (see if you can spot john ridgely)the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex. he plays this character almost exactly like that of the thuggie leader in "gunga din". he's something to watch! and marjorie main is excellent and gets her best role since "dead end".my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like "city for conquest".hooray for warners!

a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only, the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids. as a matter of fact, with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces, at least for continuity's sake.speaking of ann sheridan, she is the one true shining light of this movie. to paraphrase a cliché, ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd!another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan. unfortunately , this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. for a better example of the sheridan-reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row.

fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography,screenplay,directing and editing.the story/script is only average at best.this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy.......

yes, shakespeare would indeed have been proud. laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad. kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience. very nice work.there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected. cassio's slaying, for instance, was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart, causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all.did i mention michael maloney? his madness striken roderigo was unusual; annoying even.if you haven't seen othello before, see this. if you haven't read othello, see this. if you haven't heard othello, see this. you do, on the other hand, do yourself a favour by reading it, seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too.

i claim no matter how hard i seek i'll never find a better movie version of "othello". if you love kenneth branagh's magnificent masterpieces "much ado about nothing" (1993) and "hamlet" (1996) as much as i do i'm dead certain you'll also find oliver parker's "othello" irresistible. laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career. he was quite terrific in "boys n the hood" (1991) - i've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement. that was, of course, way before i saw this.he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job. irène jacob is absolutely charming desdemona and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked, manipulate villain iago. marvelous "othello" is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare's ingenious works. it deals with his favorite topics: crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy. this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i've seen that's based on william shakespeare's plays.

branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic. branagh plays iago better than i've seen the character played in film or on stage. some might say this film is overly iago-centric, but i disagree. fishburne, the first black othello in film history ironically, delivers a powerful performance. fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the moor of venice may be one of his best. the one problem i have with this film, is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. desdemona's character is given far less depth than she has in the play. in this film, she might as well not be added at all. one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film, was the subtraction of a conversation between iago and desdemona at the beginning of the second act. this part of the play shows that desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film. there were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film. however, if you have not read the play, or seen a film version of othello before, i recommend this movie. the story, cut or not, is still incredibly enthralling. the acting, as stated previously, is very good. if some important scenes had been added, and desdemona's character been prioritized a bit further, this would be a great movie. as it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original. i give it a marginal recommendation.

my college professor says that othello may be shakespeare's finest drama. i don't know if i agree with him yet. i bought this video version of the film. first i love kenneth branagh as iago, he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. surprisingly, he didn't direct it but played a role. lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do. not that there was a british vs. american issue about it. in fact, if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do. apart from other shakespeare tragedies, this is dealt with the issue of race. something that has existed since the beginning of time. the relationship between iago and emilia could have been better and shown the complicatedness of their union together. while othello loves desdemona with all his heart, he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non-moorish man like cassio. it's quite a great scene at the end of the film but i won't reveal the ending. it's just worth watching. i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare.

laurence fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and welles; and he further suffers from kenneth branagh. this irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. olivier recognized that potential in his production, and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage. i didn't nearly realize the possibilities of iago, shakespeare's most evil character, but branagh shows us the depths. nice to see the views of venice, too.

students often ask me why i choose this version of othello. shakespeare's text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an "r" rating.i have several reasons for using this production: first, i had not seen a depiction of the moor that actually made me sympathetic to othello until i saw fishburne play him. i saw james earl jones and christopher plummer play othello and iago on broadway, and it was wonderful. plummer's energy was especially noticeable. but in spite of jone's incredible presence both physically and vocally, the character he played just seemed too passive to illicit from me a complete emotional purgation in the aristotelian sense. jones, in fact, affirmed what i felt when in an interview he noted that he had played othello as passive--seeing iago as basically doing him over. unfortunately this sapped my grief for the character destruction. thus, i felt sympathy for jone's moor but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man. in contrast, fishburne's othello is a strong and vigorous figure familiar with taking action. thus, iago's temptation to actively deal with what is presented to othello as his wife's unfaithfulness is a perversion of the general's positive quality to be active not passive.1 the horror of the story is that this good quality in othello becomes perverted. fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic.second, fishburne is the first black actor to play othello in a film. both orsen wells and anthony hopkins did fine film versions, but they were white men in black face.2 why is this important? why should a black actor be the black man on the stage?3 certainly in shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls. perhaps then, the reason is the same. female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the shakespearian stage because they understand best what shakespeare's genius was trying to present. a gifted black actor should play the moor because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what shakespeare's genius recognized: the pain of being marginalized because of race. an important theme in othello is isolation caused by racism. although it is a mistake to insert american racism into a shakespearian play, there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters. many, including desdimona's father, think that a union between a venetian white christian woman and a north african black christian man is unnatural.third, shakespeare was never g rated. he never has been. his stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language. but shakespeare's genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty.

... or was honest iago actually smirking at the end, as he died?loved how the bard's iambic pentameter just rolled of fishburne's tongue, with excellent clarity and emotion.and how branagh made honest iago seem to celebrate his own evilness...this is a wonderful film.i have often thought that shakespeare is inherently not film-friendly: he uses words to create pictures in our minds, which creates a perennial battle with the camera, which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel. every effort to film shakespeare ought really to be celebrated. it is not an easy thing to do.

i don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello, but i've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity.according to the biographical notes, fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, fishburne's portrayal is focused more on othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. in a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.the acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing. (even shakesspeare, after all, can be improved upon, now and again -- and if that be treason, make the most of it!

i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. the cast played very well, too, and i liked the script following shakespeare's original text so faithfully. but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona. i have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio - although it was happening only in othello's imagination. at first, i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly. but as a whole, i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene.

shakespeare's plays have a way of transcending time. the language somehow breaks the time barrier. but perhaps it is the actors who really do that.after the disappointment in romeo and juliet (the version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio), was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare. to my surprise othello was great!iago's character was played so well by the kenneth fellow! even thoough iago is really evil and despicable, the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be, a pleasure for the audience to hate. i have to say that fishburne's performance here was really good as well.i recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book) alike.

othello, the classic shakespearen story of love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. i remember studying this story in high school, actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was, the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship, love, and racism perfectly. i mean, when you really do study this story, you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.othello is the big time soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter, desdemona, the king is infuriated, but excepts it. othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend, cassio, his side man instead of iago, who has stood by othello. due to his insane jealousy, he's out for revenge. still pretending to be othello's best friend, he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio, never says that they are, just makes othello think that it's happening. othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out.othello is an incredible story, i highly recommend that you read it. it's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it, it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel, or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona, how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. this is a terrific movie, great acting, good sets, and good direction, this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.10/10

you do not get more dark or tragic than "othello" and this movie captures the play fairly well, with outstanding performances by lawrence fishburne and irene jacob. fishburne's expresses to the viewer othello's torment as he falls prey to iago's lies very convincingly, even providing a realistic epileptic episode. jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of iago's revenge against othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear which since no motive for iago's behavior is offered). although kenneth brannagh (sp?) displays his usual talent for shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. the characters of cassio and emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they, like iago, seem more crucial to the plot. i have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out, but i know that shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant ones, very well.if i had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly, and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more. the director had a great cast, and no one offered a bad performance. the relationship between cassio and othello and that between emilia and desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film. i have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get a sense of this very late into the movie. also, othello and desdemona need more time together. although their anguish is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met. on the other hand, maybe the did just meet---like romeo and juliet.in brief: good performances, too short.

i've always enjoyed kenneth branagh's versions of the shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than "the-always-great-actor" laurence fishburne. surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he's a wonderful actor, but in this one we're truly given the real othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with fishburne's well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we're finally given a black othello!i don't think they could have chosen a better othello. who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, iréne jacob's desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. do watch it.

i must admit, out of the eros movie collection, this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed. the story is something that really keeps you watching. a lot of the eros films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it. all centering around sex, and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film. and oh dear god, never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun. it does not work that it is almost laughable, but you do not want to waste the energy to do so."losing control" is exactly as its name comes on. the protagonist, the leading character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful kira reed). the control is the control a person has over their senses, their body and feelings. and one man changes everything for her, makes her a different woman almost. but the mirror is shattered at the same time. this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first!!10/10

all kira reed fans must see this. the film's premise has struggling romance novelist kira unable to come up with any new ideas. she's also getting over a divorce. however, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). they go into a corner room and they do it. thankfully, kira gets a condom out (now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. remember kids, safe sex). later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. but eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. when she does, all hell breaks loose, and i'll leave it at that. this is easily the best of these soft-core playboys films i've seen. check this out, and marvel at the greatness of kira.

when it comes to the erotic genre, i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch. this movie is different. julie davis (i love you don't touch me) directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller. kira is convincing as "kim" a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery's "the man" a handsome stranger. kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role, and as actress, giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability. i believe it to be her best performance yet. and julie davis' direction is a great gift to erotica.

after, i watched the films... i thought, "why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office?" even thought the movie had a clever/unusal scenario, the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting. for a korean movie... i liked the fighting scenes. if you want to watch a film without thinking, this is the film for you. but i got to admit... the film was kind of childish... 6/10

i enjoyed this film very much. many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. cinematography was average. the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. editing, however, was very neat and unusual.the acting was also very good. kim ha neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the korean soap-opaeras. but this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable.what i like the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated. there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale. there was no such crap in this movie.very funny and well-done.

my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. hollywood should learn more from korean productions. sex is not always required in a good romantic movie.the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie. i like the part when ji-hoon almost kissed su-wan. the funniest moment is when ji-hoon punched su-wan's first love because he dumped su-wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. how he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings smiles to the audience.mao points: 8/10

like "my sassy girl", this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet, but that's where the similarities end. the story is generally about this rebellious guy named ji-hoon (kwon sang woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named su-wan (kim ha neul), a woman who comes from a poor background, but happens to be the same age as him. add to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after ji-hoon for revenge), a scorned, thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity for ditching the lessons, and you generally can guess the whole story. did i mention it's a romantic comedy? this movie has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between kim ha nuel and kwon sang woo, that bring a lot of energy to the story. the romantic elements also work because of that reason. and, i must say, i'd want a girlfriend more like kim ha nuel than that girl from "my sassy girl" (personality-wise, at least). she has some spunk, but it's more on the cute, sweet, good-hearted way. characters are already mostly likable (so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than "my sassy girl"--an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit), and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. the story kind of sags, though, about 2/3 of the way (where it sort of treads on familiar, standard fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it picks up a bit again. overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10

i first came across 'my tutor friend' accidentally one or two years ago while tv surfing. prior to that, i'd never watched any korean films before in my whole life, so mtf was really the first korean film i've ever watched. and- what a delightful surprise! i was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end, and had a great time laughing. its comic style is quite different from those of the hong kong comic films (which i've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well), breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience. i thought there're quite a few scenes and tricks in mtf that are pretty hilarious, witty, and original too.i watched mtf the second time a few days ago, and having watched it once already, the surprise/comic effect on me kind of mitigated. that has, however, by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film. instead, something else came through this time- it moved me- the story about how two young, seemingly 'enemies' who're utterly incompatible get thrown together, and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves, reminds me of the long gone high school days. to me, su wan and ji hoon are actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them, a quality that separates them from people like say, ji hoon's sassy girlfriend.the film is divided into two distinct parts- the 1st part deals with the 'fight' between su wan and ji hoon, and is more violent and faster in pace. after ji hoon gets a pass in his final examination and su wan dances the (in ji hoon's opinion) provocative dance, things start to change. the pace slows down and... ji hoon suddenly realizes he cares for su wan more than he could ever imagine. so the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss.just one last comment. i find this to be a bit unbelievable- the fact that a 21-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his 'cool' is just a little... odd. i guess that shows that ji hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isn't really what his appearance seems. btw, kwong san woo (ji hoon) does have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time.

it is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. there is a fair balance between the two. this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, i don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. it isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, pretty simple, good chemistry between the leads, and a fun watch. i'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. i'd watch it again...with a girl.

after having seen "marrying mafia", i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business. but this one brought my faith back.leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled, rich but charistmatic high school student guy. he is actually female character's age. through some hilarious quarrells, these two end up being great friends.i was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency. he was such a revelation!! actress kim ha nul was also charming as usual.this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude, sex scenes. it was brilliant, lovely , fresh, made me want to see it again.

a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001-hit "my sassy girl" but is able to enchant most of the time. the biggest applause should go to the two leads. ha-neul kim is both sweet and quirky, sang-woo kwon is both attractive and rebellious. the chemistry between the two is very good.director kyeong-hyeong kim uses some cg-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang-woo kwon can shine. i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated "volcano high". and that boy has a future - those looks, those fight techniques, and a romantic lead. not bad.well, i can make it short: nice film. my rating: 7/10

mitchell leisen's fifth feature as director, and he shows his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous movies were heavy dramas. he also plays a cameo as the conductor.you can tell it is a pre code movie, and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards (like 30+ years). leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley. what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience.as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless, and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas. gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark.the musical numbers are interesting and some good (the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. this is where this movie could have been a lot better.

it's good to see that vintage film buff have correctly categorized their excellent dvd release as a "musical", for that's what this film is, pure and simple. like its unofficial remake, murder at the windmill (1949), the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with kitty carlisle and gertrude michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including ann sheridan, lucy ball, beryl wallace, gwenllian gill, gladys young, barbara fritchie, wanda perry and dorothy white. carl brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to "cocktails for two". undoubtedly the movie's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times. however, it's gertrude michael who steals the show, not only with her rendition of "sweet marijauna" but her strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. as for the rest of the cast, we could have done without jack oakie and victor mclaglen altogether. the only good thing about oakie's role is his weak running gag with cult icon, toby wing. in fact, to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over-indulged and over-strained, super-dumb inspector mclaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though, would you believe, in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect. director mitch leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close-up after close-up.

during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain.i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy. unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on. while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them. this wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent, but its not. there is only one good song. worse its as if the studio knew they had one song, cocktails for two, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a big production number, as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music. i don't think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much. the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie. charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers, or are willing to scan through them. its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more.

a very enjoyable film, providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. it may not come close to agatha christie or even thin man mysteries as a film noir, but it's much more interesting than your typical "boy meets girl" or "let's put on a show" backstage musical. as a musical, it's no busby berkley or freed unit, but it can boost the classic "coctails for two" and the weird "sweet marijuana". the film runs in real time during a stage show, opening night of the "vanities", where a murder - and soon another - is discovered backstage. is the murderer found out before the curtain falls? sure, but the search is fun, even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief (luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls, toby wing). the stupid cop is just a bit too stupid, the leading hero is just a bit too likable, the leading lady a bit too gracious, the bitchy prima donna bit too bitchy, and the enamoured waif a bit too self-sacrificing, but as stereotypes go, they are pretty stylish. there's a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls, who are chosen even better than the girls for a busby berkley musical of the same period, who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side. yes, this film could have been much better than it is, and the duke ellington number is an embarrassment, but if you enjoy diving into old movies, this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip.

this murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and plausibility. based on a stage play by broadway showman earl carroll and others, it combines a whodunit plot with a backstage ambiance (a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theatre where a musical revue is being staged).the cast is impressive and varied: tough-goofy victor mclaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never fails to leer idiotically at whatever showgirl happens to be in sight; jack oakie (the prewar jack lemmon  or was jack lemmon the postwar jack oakie?) as the harassed director who must coordinate the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes; the ever-homely jessie ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep, dark secrets; dorothy stickney, who has a stunning close-up monologue near the end, as the tremulous maid madly in love with the male lead; carl brisson, the danish star, as that very male lead, warbling the classic "cocktails for two" not once but twice; kitty carlisle, operatically delivering "where do they come from and where do they go" and other johnston-coslow songs; the glorious gertrude michael, who parted from us too soon, as a mean-spirited showgirl whose love for brisson is spurned; the usually ridiculous toby wing who here at least is the center of a laugh-getting running joke.when the plot complications get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or fun and tuneful musical number to distract the viewer. the film's most celebrated sequence is the "marahuana" number, led by michaels, but aside from its controversial history, it's really one of the lesser musical offerings. all of the songs here are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard proscenium theatre space, as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setup of the busby berkeley style.

financially strapped paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and mitch leisen tagged as the director. what happened? two things: busby berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst charlie chan first draft down the street. i have to believe that the cutting was out of leisen's hands since the great duke ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'sweet marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing toby wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied jack oakie. carl brisson's acting is bland as melba toast but he's a competent singer. maclaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. and try to spot lucy in the chorus. this rates a 7.0 as a curiosity. feb 2010 re-think: i recently gave the film another look and now feel i was wrong to berate the lack of busby berkeley production numbers. i can understand leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. i still have enormous issues with the editing however. paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the production code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's search for beauty). a must see for pre-code buffs.

since this is black history month and i'm reviewing the achievements of many african-americans on film in chronological order, i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it. their jazz version of franz liszt's "rhapsody" was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture. many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisle's especially "sweet marijuana", carl brisson's "cocktails for two" as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier, and the ones by gertrude michael who's great as the woman you love to hate. jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love/hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you. and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a "not now" from him every time. while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen, i wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it. and get a load of how naked the women here are (though of course their breasts are covered, either by their hands or some flimsy top). this was very obviously pre-code. worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing. p.s. as a long-time louisiana resident, i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native.

i just viewed murder at the vanities in the newly-released universal pre-code set, and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end. most of the other commentators have covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but i wanted to add a few additional notes. brisson and carlisle are relatively bland, compared to even most of the minor players, and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what they're singing (carlisle being a trained opera singer, brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes). the great victor mclaglen and jack oakie play well off each other, with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers. yes, lucille ball and ann sheridan are vanities girls, but let's not forget the splendid jazz singer ernestine anderson in the "ebony rhapsody" number. gail patrick makes one of her early appearances, sounding a bit like eve arden; patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series. then there's jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistress--you'll spot her also in david copperfield (as aunt peggoty) and the bank dick. the music is very good--brisson introducing the standard "cocktails for two" in two different scenes; "sweet marihuana" with barely clad peyote button girls in the background (blood dripping on one chorine's white skin was wonderfully chilling); the "ebony rhapsody," with duke ellington's orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixing it up. and i believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix--and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.

released just before the production code crackdown in july, 1934, mitch leisen's all-star paramount musical is leeringly suggestive -some even claim misogynistic- and highly entertaining. two murders occur on the opening night of "earl carroll's vanities" (one on-stage!), but that doesn't stop the manager (jack oakie) from putting on a show as a lascivious police detective (victor mclaglen) investigates. everyone is hiding something and gypsy rose lee must have seen this backstage murder mystery before she penned "the g-string murders" as the denouement is similar (although more satisfying here). gertrude michael, as a vicious diva, stops the show (in more ways than one) with her exotic "sweet marijuana" number and duke ellington finishes with the truncated "rape of the rhapsody". the hit song, "cocktails for two", came from this film. a bizarre and bawdy camp classic highly recommended! here's louella o. parsons in the "los angeles examiner" on may 17, 1934earl carroll's hand-picked beauties' pirouette about on the grauman united artists screen in a fig leaf and not much else. but september morn herself never had a better figure than these charmers, who are made up to please the eye, especially the eye of the tired businessman. but don't for a moment think mr. carroll's girls, au naturelle, are the only attraction. believe it or not, murder at the vanities is a musical comedy thriller, if you know what i mean -a murder mystery incorporated in a musical show. it all happens on the opening night at the time the play is in progress and a search is on for a murderer. just by way of suspense, a cop threatens to stop the show every few minutes. victor mclaglen is something new in cops. all the time he is trying to track down the murderer, he keeps his eye fastened on the chorus beauties. the murder mystery is good with the exception of the denouement, which is pretty flat. probably faulty direction. dorothy stickney, who plays the maid, is about as melodramatic as the heroine in a ten, twenty, and thirty show. for no good reason, she rates a never-ending closeup in the big dramatic scene. the girl ensembles are good, and it's a positive relief to get away from the inevitable overhead shots. the costumes are beautiful; in fact, this is a musical that paramount can feel is really to their credit. as for carl brisson -well, he would be an addition to any show. good-looking with a delightful singing voice and an easy, assured manner, he is all his press agents claim for him. i also like kitty carlisle, who plays the leading lady in the show. gertrude michael, as the deep-eyed villianess, gives an interesting if rather fictional portrayal. jack oakie, as the stage manager, is the same old wisecracking jack, but we wouldn't change him. jessie ralph is excellent as the seamstress. others in the cast are charles middleton, gail patrick, donald meek, barbara fritchie, toby wing and lona andre. the screen play is by carey wilson and rufus king, and the direction by mitchell leisen. the music is by arthur johnstone and the lyrics by sam coslow. in addition to murder at the vanities, there is a mickey mouse cartoon, a paramount newsreel, and a two-reeler, the wrong direction.i disagree with lolly on the denouement, it's satisfying if over-the-top. why would she blame the director? was she displeased with the story's ending -or the way it was staged? and what's a "ten, twenty, or thirty show"? note the swipe taken at busby berkeley and his "overhead shots". as hard as it may be to believe today, the public was tiring of buzz' schtick by may, 1934. mitch leisen said, "if you are showing a stage show that's supposed to be in a theater, you should stay within the bounds of the proscenium arch, and not do a buzz berkeley routine with a stage set that's acres big." q: don't you think berkeley's spectacular effects justified taking this liberty? ml: apparently they did because they're reviving all of his pictures and none of mine, but personally i don't like it.

there are moments in the film that are so dreadful, your teeth ache. but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies innocuous and bland, paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style. vanities is so horrifically anti-female that it's delicious. as kitty carlisle sings, women are displayed with price tags that would insult a bronx hooker. they emerge from clams (nudge,nudge;wink,wink) in postures of absolute submission. minions of the law, so stupid they cannot find the door, get to look up their skirts and snicker. bare-breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti (could they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) while we listen to "sweet marijuana" and watch as blood falls on a chorines's breast.sure, carl brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn't seem to have a clue what he is saying. but it's all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking.taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise. watch this with a charter member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows.toby wing, by the way, is the icing on the cake. and duke ellington doesn't hurt either.a must stroll down memory lane.

a murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast, its production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film.gertrude michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, kitty carlisle and carl brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "sweet marijuana" number (which was also on a 70s bette midler album). so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.we quickly learn that the maid (dorothy stickney) loves brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (jessie ralph) is brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (jack oakie) butts into everything. lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. the show's best-known song is "cocktails for two." kitty carlisle also sings the haunting "where do they come from?" and there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington! quite the cast.some terrific acting here, especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney. kitty carlisle is quite good as well. brisson is a total zero though.charles middleton plays homer, toby wing plays nancy, donald meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls.

fleet was released in 1936 during the middle of the depression when people were having a tough time worldwide finding jobs or even finding food to put on the table. in europe hitler was on the rise, along with other nationalist/ socialist whackjobs. in the united states seeds of the cartel sown with the federal reserve act and the income tax amendment (16) were beginning to bear fruit for connected finance capitalists and their dominating secret societies. for the average guy and girl, times were tough. enter hollywood with at least some hopeful imagesi don't think we can properly call them propaganda at this point, even though this particular movie revolves around war-preparatory naval exercises. the real issue for boys and girls then, as now, was how to hook up with the right one, lead a decent life, have wonderful children, with a modicum of grace and elegance. the odds were long. ...for my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site thecoffeecoaster.com.brian wright copyright 2007

i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less 'polished' than the other fred and ginger films, not to mention the slightly problematic casting of harriet hillard in the lead romantic role. once again with these films, the plot is of a minor consequence - astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime-a-dance music hall. although their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they are bogged down by an un-involving main story of hilliard and randolph scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them. although it was a last minute decision, hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout. the film may have benefited in promoting lucille ball's wise-cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene, and would have made a great helen broderick-type side-kick to rogers in this kind of bright film (see 'stage door', made the following year, for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). that scott's one-dimensional neanderthal character eventually falls in love with hilliard's is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy! now onto the important part, the singing and dancing: nothing more can be said about "let's face the music and dance" other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes. however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well; "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket" is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers, and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous, perfectly synchronized dancing. other highlights are "i'd rather lead the band" and "let yourself go" which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together. i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano; it seems this man's talents were endless!overall, i actually prefer this to 'top hat' and 'swing time' (although only just), as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved, it is hard to dislike the fun factor.

of course, the story line for this movie isn't the best, but the dances are wonderful. this story line is different from other astaire-rogers movies in that neither one is "chasing" the other. the dancing of fred and ginger is what makes this movie.

plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie, but "follow the fleet"'s screenplay is exceptionally mediocre. fred and ginger still come off all right--they play "bake" baker and sherry martin, dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy. when they meet again, their love-hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments. but for much of the movie, they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry's sister connie (harriet hilliard), her love for sailor bilge smith (randolph scott), bilge's dalliance with another woman, and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father. though hilliard is rather charming, this plot is uninteresting.but at the same time, "follow the fleet" is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents. astaire gets two good solos with "we saw the sea" and "i'd rather lead a band." he sings expressively and, of course, dances electrifyingly--and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual. rogers sings the catchy "let yourself go" and later does a solo tap-dance to the same tune. the three duets really save the film, even though they're all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses. fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of "let yourself go". later, they sing and dance "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket" as if it were an early rehearsal of the number, flubbing the choreography to comic effect. at the end, the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet--it makes it part of a show-within-the-show. the situation is contrived, but the song, "let's face the music and dance", is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote (it's reminiscent of cole porter), and the dancing matches it in elegance. quintessential astaire and rogers.it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of "follow the fleet" again, and, in fact, it's not necessary, because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers. but i could watch the songs over and over.

while i am not a big fan of musicals, i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun. sure, they can be a bit formulaic, but even though you know what is going to happen, they still are very pleasing to watch. however, despite this, i was a bit disappointed in this outing. part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance. without edward everett horton or eric blore, the film seems to be a bit lacking--especially in the "fun" department. the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with follow the fleet. in addition, unlike the usual character played by astaire, this one is more of a jerk--as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again. and, as a result, it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film. plus, although the music is by irving berlin, the songs just don't seem as memorable. in fact, none of the songs were all that special and i can't recall any of them even though i just saw the movie. while this is still a cute and worthwhile film, it just lacks the sparkle and magic of some of their other films. good but far from great.

if hollywood is to be believed, being in the the navy is nothing but a bludge. though the sailors may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean, it seems that their oceanic duties are completely non-existent, and somehow fred astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would-be romantics. such is the world of astaire and rogers. mark sandrich's previous film, 'top hat (1935),' completely ignored the great depression that was then bringing america to its knees, and presented audiences with a glittering world of the rich and famous; it was the film's optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contributed to its success. likewise, here sandrich deliberately forgets that the life of a naval officer is difficult and draining, and instead substitutes the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers."bake" baker (astaire) and sherry martin (rogers) are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage proposal. after bake returns from several years of duty in the navy, he finds sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated san francisco ballroom. while the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and rebuff each other, sherry's plain, music-teacher sister (harriet hilliard, looking really quite pretty) receives a complete makeover and tries to charm superficial sailor bilge "bilgey" smith (randolph scott). there are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigans, a few moments of mistaken identity, and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it's in. particularly amusing is the scene in which bake sabotages a performer's audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl; unluckily for both of them, it is an unfortunate sherry who drinks the bicarbonate of soda and loses her ability to sing.'follow the fleet (1936)' was the fifth winning collaboration between fred astaire and ginger rogers, and the third (of five) in which sandrich directed the pair. irving berlin provided the film's music and lyrics, and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining, even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in 'top hat (1935),' 'swing time (1936)' or 'shall we dance (1937).' astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich-man-about-town persona, without much success, but it's hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could only accompany being considerably wealthy. the side-plot of the romance between connie and bilge works well with the antics of the two main stars, and harriet hilliard (wearing a brunette wig to avoid clashing with ginger's blonde hair) has a couple of emotional solo numbers, including "get thee behind me satan," which was originally written for 'top hat.'

follow the fleet, an rko production in 1936, stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy. although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together, rko helped them to once again create a worth-while storyline that incorporates relevant situations to society at the time it was made. the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy.the general plot of the movie revolves around bake baker, a sailor in the u.s. navy played by fred astaire, and sherry martin, bake's former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers. their story begins when bake is on the ship and his shipmate bilge smith finds a photo of the two of them together, and bake reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him, so bilge suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land, in hopes that she might have a friend. the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin, sherry's sister, is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is escorted by a gentleman. she turns around to find bilge behind her with a bag full of beverages, so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well. connie then finds sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck sherry does with men, so sherry suggests she get a makeover from her friends while she is performing on stage. connie gets made over, and enters the ballroom once again, and approaches bilge again, who is awestruck by the sight of her. this commences the second romantic storyline between bilge and connie.throughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are transitioned between altering comedic reliefs of the two couples' troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot. bake and sherry hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it, reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together. similarly, bilge is able to swoon connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her, and they retire to her house. this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling measures that brings the rising action back down. bake left sherry the previous night to retire to the ship before midnight, and told her that he would come for her in the morning. unfortunately the ship sets course after the shipmates have returned, upsetting sherry and leaving her to think bake was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he's on land. the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a "party of big shots" is taking a tour of the ship. this alternate storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film, as well as help build confidence and fondness of bake's overall good intentions. the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from bake and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company. the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play, and bake gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing, which ultimately helps brighten the mood of the film, as well as bring happiness to the sailors. after returning to the couple's intertwined stories, sherry is trying to prove to bake that she does not need his help with landing a job. unfortunately bake is unaware that she is auditioning, and goes to put in a good word for sherry when he overhears his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady auditioning. bake takes it upon himself to help sherry out by tampering with her water, making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition. in addition to bake's mistake, connie spent all of her money to repair a ship that she was hoping bilge would take over as captain. she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over, but bilge was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested, so he stood her up. the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples, ending the movie with the happiness of both couples. the use of the altering stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles. the intertwining stories are also able to relate with one another, as well as incorporate other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the concluding scenes. although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that incorporate romance, comedy, song, and dance, follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters.

79/100. fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together. although this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical. there are a few outstanding musical numbers, good support from randolph scott. two notable appearances, betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances. ball is particularly good, and a blonde as well. the "let's face the music and dance" is one of the musical duo's best numbers ever. harriet hilliard, better know as harriet nelson of "ozzie and harriet" plays ginger roger's sister. the basic plot is pretty familiar, but with a cast this exceptional, it works. excellent art direction and score.

what an entertaining movie. astaire and randolph scott are in the navy. astaire has to woo back ginger in san francisco, while scott must be persuaded that harriet hilliard is worthy of being his wife. everything works out fine.it's sometimes argued, and i can see why, that scott's romance with hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down. especially painful are hilliard's singing of sappy love songs. i could have done without her singing, right enough, but i found the romance rather touching. hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher, wearing a pair of spectacles, no makeup, and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast. no wonder scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister ginger and a slinky lucille ball. the problem is that after her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before, only with a glossier outfit. it's tough enough for a homely guy. but at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular, then he can collect women anyway, even if he looks like jojo the dog-faced boy. but what does a plain-looking woman do? the same avenues to romance aren't open to her. henry kissinger had groupies. did margaret thatcher? it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours. as a kind of a footnote, i must mention that randolph scott was rumored to be bisexual by hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on, and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting homely hilliard off -- "women don't interest me, sister." the movie probably gives more quality time to ginger rogers than any of her other films with astaire. and she's marvelous. she's beautiful, sexy, a talented actress and dancer, and the script gives her good comic lines too. "let's kiss and make up," suggests astaire. "let's just make up," she says, "that will give you something to work on." it's also the only film she made with astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition. (choreographed by hermes pan.) her performance is accidentally sabotaged by astaire who slips some alka seltzer or something into her water, and she hiccups through her number, burping being too indelicate for the time.as a dancer, i'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur, but i think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film. their first, during a dancing contest, "let yourself go," is the most wildly exuberant of any i can remember. and the only dramatic duet, "let's face the music and dance," must be among their finest. the last step as they exit is startling.i like the film for reasons with personal resonance. i remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown san diego, next to a shop called "the seven seas" that catered to sailors. i was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of astaire and scott. what i mean is, here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality, and yet, unlike most of their other teamings, pays its dues anyway. jumping ship, astaire calls out for a "water taxi." i had just taken a water taxi ashore myself. the uniforms are correct to the period (unlike, say, those in "on the town"). and they're worn properly, hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back. and there are two incidents in which astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable. an officer stops astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain, "they were playing when the call was sounded, sir. i'm certain no breach of discipline was intended." it's what an officer -- a good officer -- would say, and nobody laughs.the series was getting a little repetitious by the time "follow the fleet" was made so instead of putting fred into high society and a tuxedo, they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead. it was a good idea. and the dance numbers are up to the concept.

throughly enjoy all the musical numbers each time i see this movie. never seem to tire of it. fred and ginger are always a pleasure to watch. seeing "lucy" and betty grable before they hit the big time, is fun to watch.

had this film been put together a tad better, it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers. as it is, it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot, i.e., randolph scott romancing rogers' sister, played by harriet hilliard (that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers).astaire and scott are two navy men. scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend (a blond but unmistakable lucille ball) to glamor her up. meanwhile, astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off. the result is some wonderful dance numbers, with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately: "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket," "let yourself go," and "i'd rather lead the band." hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl, although she sings her two songs well, "but where are you?" and "get thee behind me, satan" - one poster didn't care for that song, but i love the title. rogers is vivacious, and a youthful astaire is a dynamo.the highlight of the movie comes at the end with "let's face the music and dance," one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire. in it, they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy. it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again.

this really is a great movie. some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever. but basically, all of fred and ginger's movies are the same. after the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again. he adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. he has a winning personality and a great smile. randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. ok, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: errol flynn, alan ladd, victor mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him.

from a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. it's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. especially such a shallow and inconstant man. he's obviously a player (i wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ick!). even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he's (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. i wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him! his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me.apart from that subplot, i did like the movie. how can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! (you can tell they were from san francisco.... ;d) the "rehearsal" dance was great, watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the "correct steps" was great. the last dance scene "face the music" with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. and i really enjoyed "we saw the sea" (though they did use it a few too many times, as if they realized it was their best song). anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (imo) - and the songs were ok, but the dancing was worth watching the film for. i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set.it's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time. i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land.

fred astaire and ginger rogers, hollywood's premiere dance team, were usually dressed to the nines and gliding through elaborately exaggerated art deco sets in the 1930's. however, they go a bit more downscale for this 1936 outing, the fifth of their ten musicals together. this time, astaire foregoes his top hat, white tie and tails to become a bubblegum-chewing sailor named "bake" baker; and rogers plays dance hall entertainer sherry martin, who was bake's partner - dancing and otherwise - before he enlisted. consequently, unlike the mistaken identity ploys and romantic hesitancies prevalent in most of their previous pairings, they are already a couple from the film's outset.directed by mark sandrich (who guided five of their pairings), the film bears a narrative similarity to 1935's "roberta" in which they are but one of two couples featured in the storyline. in fact, randolph scott plays the other male lead in both films, this time as bake's womanizing crewmate, "bilge" smith. he is partnered with not irene dunne (who understandably turned down this follow-up) but harriet hilliard. just married to ozzie nelson in real life and decades before ozzie & harriet, hilliard plays sherry's spinsterish sister connie who falls hard for bilge. in the silly plot, she is given a makeover by a young, bleached blonde lucille ball, and there is s classic three-way shot of hilliard, ball and a kewpie-doll adorable betty grable in front of a mirror.speaking of the story, what there is of one is credited to allan scott and dwight taylor and goes something like this...bake and bilge are on shore leave in san francisco where they end up in a dance hall with their rowdy shipmates. bake finds sherry working there, while bilge runs into connie first when she comes in as a dowdy spinster and then showing up as a glamour girl. romance blooms for both couples. connie and sherry inherit a steamer from their father, but they need money to keep it afloat. multiple misunderstandings occur in both relationships, but it all works out when they turn the steamer into a theater and put on a fundraising musical revue. it's about as silly as it sounds, but it does provide a good excuse for some memorable irving berlin tunes and a trio of astaire-rogers dances.the first two are casual in tone - a dance contest set to the percolating "let yourself go" where they show off mercilessly to win and a physical shipboard comedy routine set to the toe-tapping "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket". however, their last dance is a classic return to formality with a melodramatic piece beautifully set to a stunning arrangement of "let's face the music and dance". intriguingly, this movie contains not only an astaire dance solo but the only time rogers ever had a dance solo to herself in one of their movies, an energetic tap routine again set to "let yourself go". dressed in a creamy satin sailor outfit, she also sings the same song most winningly near the beginning of the film.acting-wise, astaire and rogers are in typically zesty comic form here. while scott plays his role with his trademark cock-eyed virility, hilliard is an extremely dull presence, and as a former band singer, she performs two berlin love songs in a frustratingly diffident manner. regardless, the magic generated by astaire and rogers in their prime make this essential viewing. the 2005 dvd has several good extras beginning with a thirteen-minute featurette, "follow the fleet: the origins of those dancing feet," about how astaire and rogers started to work together. there is also a live-action "soundie" called "melody master: jimmie lunceford and his dance orchestra", a poultry-themed cartoon called "let it be me," and the original theatrical trailer.

this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire-rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals. as usual the storyline needn't detain us though for the record it was based on a play, shore leave, that also served as the basis for a broadway musical, hit the deck. anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters, as always, is the music, lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle. it's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1) we get to see astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs, one of which, i'm building up to an awful let-down, had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman, albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts. he gets to perform a little-known but excellent berlin number, i'd rather lead a band as well as duetting on i'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt - let's face the music and dance, one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team. so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard doesn't exactly set the screen on fire; we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is, do they deliver. answer: in spades.

astaire and rogers at the height of their popularity. in 1936 americans thought of the navy as a place for song and dance. wwii was still a few years away. fred and ginger dance up the town.the plot is decent, but who cares... by the way, notice the cameo roles for betty grable and a glamorous lucile ball.a load of irving berlin songs, including the famous "let's face the music and dance". in that scene, ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious. fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless.ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than fred, since she had to do all the same moves, in step, and backwards...come to think of it, fred's voice was nice too. the man was effortless in motion.here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one, kick off the shoes, and enjoy the entertainment.

definitely one of the lesser of the astaire/rogers musicals. it's just very poorly plotted and paced. it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time, for example, but it feels a heck of a lot longer. this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard. scott is rarely ever interesting. i like hilliard. she's sweet, and i love at least one of her songs, "but where are you?" ("get thee behind me satan", her other number, is a weak leftover from top hat, thankfully cut from that masterpiece). follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers. the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers. the dance is just fantastic. "i'm putting all my eggs in one basket" presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet. its imperfections make it all the more perfect. and "let's face the music and dance" is easily one of irving berlin's best songs. so the film is well worth watching for its great moments.

another fun, witty, frothy rko musical with astaire and rogers, follow the fleet is a charming film. while it lacks the stand-out great tunes of swng time (although the final number "face the music and dance" is one of the team's best and rightfully so), it is hugely enjoyable, as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven. these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. while there are better fred and ginger musicals, this is certainly a must-see.

one of several musicals about sailors on leave, it is the usual sailor meets girl, complications ensue, sorted out happily kind of plot. it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too. the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat' for example and randolph scott seems out of place.there are compensations. it has some of irving berlin's choicest songs including 'let yourself go', 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance'. it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here. they do a snappy tap dance, a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same film! great versatility and artistry.it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role. she had a varied career, becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie. here she is touching without being sentimental.her two songs are simply and effectively delivered. she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film. more tightening up have made the film even better. pretty good though.

1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers. their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark sandrich's 'follow the fleet.' this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker, a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where sherry martin (rogers) is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone's ear. yep, you guessed it  they're hot for each other once again. only this time sherry's spinster sister, connie (harriet hillard) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake's robust seafaring buddy, bilge smith (randolph scott); a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy, thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general. irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic, classy score, including standards 'let yourself go', 'i'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'let's face the music and dance;' the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger. the transfer on 'follow the fleet' is a tad weaker. the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it's a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles. grain is still present. so are age related artifacts. once you've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage. the audio is mono but very nicely balanced. extras include a featurette, theatrical trailer and short subject, but oddly  no audio commentary. considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire/rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video.

this is just a great, fun, lovely film. it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people, and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. though this film may only be in black and white, it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days. the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless. this movie features great acting, beautiful song and dance numbers, and great design work and film shots. follow the fleet is also comical, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline. its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade, how it can affect those today. if you want to see something great, check this out.

one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films. great music by irving berlin. solid support from randolph scott, harriet nelson, lucille ball, betty grable, frank jenks, and astrid allwyn.terrific songs include "let yourself go," "let's face the music," and "putting all my eggs in one basket." the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers. rogers also sings "let yourself go" with grable among the backup singers.harriet nelson (then hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays rogers' mousy sister. "get thee behind me" is a song that sticks with you for days. she also sings "but where are you?" snappy and fast paced, this entry in the astaire-rogers series is one of the better ones. the classic and amazing beautiful finale, "let's face the music and dance" is among the best-known of their numbers. rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. just gorgeous. this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re-created in pennies from heaven.randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire's pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne. luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok.rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with "let yourself go".... jazzy and thumping, it's a great song.fun all the way, although i got tired of "we joined the navy" after the third time....

musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible. although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in, follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer, this time harriet hilliard.randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner. but now the two are on shore leave. fred and ginger take up right where they left off, and randy accidentally meets ginger's dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty. but randy's a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor. again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production. ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to. but the real hit of the show is let's face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show. sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair, let's face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. their dancing on this one is absolute magic.i'm sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was. but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson. that's right ozzie and harriet. it's something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky's mom on television. then again she didn't even keep her own name. neither ozzie or harriet sang on television. ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer, but harriet could really carry a tune. she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here, but where are you, both with real feeling and class. i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today.

this is my all-time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film. the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and let's face the music and dance. if i remember correctly, this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr*p but i'm woman so get over it)all in all this film gets an 8/10 from me. the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome.

this is one of the best fred astaire-ginger rogers films, or at least one of my favorites. most of the a-r movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories. this still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films.this movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs. the music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by rogers. she not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure. she dances also with fred, of course, and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor.growing up in the 1950s watching "ozzie & harriet" on television, it was a real kick the first time i saw this to see such a young harriet hilliard. no surprise than ozzie fell for this beauty. although she had that short early '30s hairstyle, i recognized her voice right away. also in this movie are quick appearances by betty grable and lucille ball, but i have to admit that i have yet to out ball. i can't find her, but i know she's in here.astaire, except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and randolph scott - although better in westerns - is likable, too.this is simply a nice, feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of astaire and rogers.

the plot intellect is about as light as feather down. but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in "the gay divorcee" and "top hat" is now absent. instead of the typical accidental acquaintance, the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin, who are still in love since their dancing days.of course, being a 30s musical, there's the problems of misunderstood romance, classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special. and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances, there's nothing better for hollywood's best entertainers than put on a show.delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show. top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end, which remains a refreshing change. fred and ginger are out again to charm the world...and charm the navy. everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable.pure classic silliness at its best. but with astaire and rogers, we just know it's got to work.rating: 8.25/10

i did enjoy this film, i thought it ended up being an old fashioned love story with a few twists. i expected him to get the girl, i won't tell you if he does or not you will need to watch the movie to find out. overall if you are looking to watch a love story this one will suffice.

parker (johnathan schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. in the meantime, he works as a telephone adviser for a manhattan psychic hotline. one day, most unfortunately, his apartment building burns down. parker and his cat make it out alive but are now stuck with the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the big apple. word comes to parker that a lady, samantha (alison eastwood) is searching for a roommate but will only accept a gay male. since parker is straight but the price is right, he decides to pretend that he is gay. samantha likes him from the start and welcomes him as her new cohabitant. but, poor parker. sam is lovely, intelligent and very desirable. how will he be able to keep his true nature under control? besides, doesn't sam have a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway? this is a sweet, likable, and humorous film with two very attractive stars in eastwood and schaech. naturally, the plot is a string of "how can i keep up this ruse" scenes, with sam asking parker for shampoo while she is showering or pleading with him to hold her in bed when she receives bad news. also, it is necessary for parker to produce his own "fake" gay mate, boris, when sam insists upon fixing him up with a man she knows. hopefully, the gay community will not find this too offensive, as this viewer thought most issues were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. for a small scale movie, the costumes, sets, and camera work were quite nice, also. therefore, if you love those funny tales of love, get this one soon. you will like what you see, i know it.

my friends and i were just discussing how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedy's are being made. we feel offended by the schlock that hollywood is serving up these days as they act like all is well.well all is not well...with the exception of a few bright spots, like this movie. it doesn't have the big name actors, the big budget, i don't think it had a big release (i rented from hollywood video) it didn't really have anything that most big budget romantic comedy's have.but it did have what most of those lack. it had great chemistry between the love interests, "parker" (jonathan schaech) and "sam" (alison eastwood). their love story wasn't forced on us like so many. the director took his time to allow these characters to truly get to know each other. their story reminded me of one of my favorites, "tootsie".the supporting cast added not only really funny comic moments, but depth to the story as well. james legros' character was absolutely priceless. sam's gay friend was hysterical. parker's interaction with his fellow employees in a psychic hotline was a lot of fun.i laughed, i cried, i remembered how great it feels to fall in love.

i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of mine.for the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood, hating this film, hating myself and even hating the french actress. and then...i don't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadn't been in years. and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand. i was in the theater for close to four hours, but it was worth it. i believe that great movies pull you inside a world, make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink. this film did that. it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever had. 

since my third or fourth viewing some time ago, i've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd. in the meantime, i've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon's monograph on jean eustache. the latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc, and in-between, impossible to see or, in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le père noël..., re-see.a few questions that hit me this moment: polish véronika's french is plenty colloquial (un maximum d' "un maximum d'"). even so, does she have an accent? i think i can tell she does. what does the absence of color add, especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed? how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter's tale? ditto alphaville. we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it, but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film's milieu? is this an enchanted isle? is alexandre's a fairy tale? alexandre's always choreographing himself, worrying about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does. or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself? how different is he from vertigo's scottie? (i say, i think, very.) what's the difference, and is there one, between eustache's léaud, and truffaut's, and godard's? how different is the present léaud? isn't he still doing it, whatever it is, in recent roles, irma vep, le pornographe, whatever, approaching old age? once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel (léaud's character) truffaut films. for a long while, every three or five minutes, down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf, tweedy coat, léaud hair, with a direction-seeking nose. i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry. i was that age, but have no idea what i myself looked like then. no scarf, at least. i do have a brother, though, who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson.

several posters have quoted renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera. the short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so. at this stage of her career bergman couldn't get arrested; in 1949 she left hollywood to make a picture in europe, fell for director roberto rossellini and never looked forward. after five turkeys in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year, after making this for renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an oscar to boot for anastasia. this is one of three movies that renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than the golden coach, which isn't hard, and about even with french can can. renoir probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and renoir picked two doozys in jean marais and mel ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up. in its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period les grandes manouvres which is no bad thing. all in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.

after watching two of his silent shorts, 'elena and her men (1956)' is my first feature-length film from french director jean renoir, and i quite enjoyed it. however, i didn't watch the film for renoir, but for star ingrid bergman, who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini, bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the united states, and i suspect that renoir's latest release did little to enhance bergman's popularity with english-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year's 'anastasia (1956)'}. she stars as elena sokorowska, a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan (jean marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be able to walk away from. this vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy, as long as you don't take it too seriously; it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff.filmed in vibrant technicolor, 'elena and her men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. bergman's polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d'état, knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a "guardian angel." perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt (mel ferrer, then audrey hepburn's husband), who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love, and love alone. this, renoir proudly suggests, is what the true french do best. 'elena and her men' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class french liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of eugène (jacques jouanneau), who can't make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them. for these sequences, renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isn't there.

i think that most of the folks who have posted comments on this movie don't understand how to watch a movie and/or have little sense of elegance. first, to assess a movie you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works together. modern sensibilities demand great drama. no, i don't mean great setting of characters and plots, but they seem to demand emotional trajectories that are greatly tragic or greatly comedic. this is a subtle movie. its beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). neither the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. it is a beautifully filmed movie that makes the most of combining sensuousness, politics, human weakness, venality...you name it. the world it's set in would be alien and not understood today...a world where if you have it you have to flaunt it now and loudly, even if you only think you have it.many people today don't understand that victorian society wasn't really victorian as people understand that term today.this movie helps set the record straight.

ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900s paris who finds herself pursued by france's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. there are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. yes, it's rules of the game redux. before it's all over even gaston modot, the jealous gamekeeper in rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-french speaker, but what the heck -- elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece.

a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend. of course the sob is very good-looking, charming, etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. watching jean pierre leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends. it's tragic, and you know she's going to end up very hurt, but there's nothing you can do. leaud is brilliant. totally empty. a blank throughout, he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants.the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love, and the next morning he puts on a record and, very sweetly and charmingly, sings along to amuse her is brilliant. the "what the hell am i doing here with this idiot" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.it's a long film, but see it in one go, preferably in a cinema. takes a while to get into, but then the time just disappears.

i hate over-long over-talky french movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all. i saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it disappeared. but i finally got to see it again in 1999, and fell in love all over again. what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. if you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!

well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on. unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice. as many good films, i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing. all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd. i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do i care why? though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation. all right, so you may disagree, perhaps it is a bit boring at times, i'm not an expert. the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka.

i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site. i would have to say it was worth the effort. however, you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes. if you don't have the staying power, get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights.now to the film, what i say will contain "spoilers" and if you don't mind, here goes: alexandre is a promiscuous bum, a womanizer and a gigolo. he lives with an older woman called marie. marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex. alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants. the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with. gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her. at this point, alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else. by chance, alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship. veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past. marie and veronika struggles for alex's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot. finally at the end, it's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex's child and alex asked her to marry him. we assume (as aforesaid with gilberte's situation) alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family. there is hope! with the title of "la maman et la putain", i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun's character of veronika. she was a whore and then she became the mother. hence, the mother and whore is the same person? anyway, what do i know! french films are mostly (not all) very chatty, aimlessly political, preaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and full of quotes. lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed. not a bad effort. 7/10.

we don't have to lose this movie, this is one of the greatest i have ever seen. jean pierre leaud is amazing (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue. jean eustache is no more on this earth, we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors. you just have to love this masterpiece. i'll never forget it.p.s.: sorry for the english...

a great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. sadly, no memorable quotes here, but this one's my favorite: alexandre: if you're leaving someone that you have loved, you have to say what i'm telling you now: "farewell, i'm going." but to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is ignoble. (didn't watch it with english subtitles)in my opinion, this expresses it all. there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others, and yet everyone longs for a little bit more truth. however, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as alexandre experiences. common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of "liberated love" by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved. it does, indeed, show this in a convincing manner, but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth: it's not that liberated love is in itself doomed to failure, but people (especially men, i think) should work on themselves and try to overcome the ruling morals before and not through practicing liberated love.that said, the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching.

** possible spoilers **i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. it reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. like veronica says, two chicks at one time. it brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. i get into the conversations too. even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? every chick, just about, that i've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. it's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.i think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica. she'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander, but veronica plays her all the way. she's brilliant. she gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. the brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in paris tonight, but i only have this refrain.but do they get married in the end, alex and veronica? mmmm? i can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.i like the film though. it kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.

this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it. you have a insecure, troubled and fascinating main character (played by jean-pierre léaud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves. this could be the premise for a fowl movie, full of rigid, cold, uninteresting commentaries. yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty. being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, jean-pierre léaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie. this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary. nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of françoise lebrun towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours and worthing every minute.

"la maman et la putain" is the beautifulest film of all time. and what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with, which is directly inspired by proust's "a la recherche du temps perdu".indeed, "la maman et la putain" and "in search of lost time" apparently tell the same story : the one of the failure of love, which repeats itself endlessly. the first woman's name is always gilberte, and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte : veronika is like a "whore gilberte", beautiful like the night, whereas gilberte was pure, and "beautiful like the day". after the failure of the first love, a second love begins, but this one is like already doomed by the first one. veronika takes the place of gilberte, in alexandre's life and in the movie. she progressively eclipses her, first by time to time, gilberte's still coming when alexandre waits for veronika,then totally. that shows it's the same sad story repeating itself, the same "unfaithful woman", like alexandre says, who appears endlessly - and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love, which makes it exist, but which also underlines its illusions.art is what causes the passage between what's outside - the illusion of love - to what's inside, which is the truth, and is a learning of this truth. for instance, when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed, he answers that he saw it in a movie, and then, that a movie, "it's made for that, to learn how to live, how to make a bed". alexander wants to live like he was in a film, he wants his life to be art. this conception of art comes from proust, with whom eustache shares the same rejection of "political art" and realism in art. "la maman et la putain" fights against a conception of art "principaly political" - see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre. like proust says : "art doesn't care for all this proclamations, and only exists in silence." first of all, art is introspection. and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected : art needs to transform reality to exist. proust writes : "i discover the illusion of realism, which is a lie". that's why "la maman et la putain" doesn't hide its artificiality, underlines by the way the actors "say" their text : "the more you seem artificial, the higher you go", said eustache.eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a "translater" of a inner truth. but, alexandre failed where eustache succeed. "la maman et la putain" tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is. you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie, which becomes saddest. you can see it in the face of alexandre, who looks more and more like a living-dead. you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer, and that after a while, nothing happens outside. at the end of the movie, when you see alexandre writing, and veronika asking if he's writing his life,you can guess that he's not, that even literature failed. the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander, who is smashes by the heaviness of reality. and in this tiny nurse's room, alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel.to explain this failure, we can say that alexandre is a balzac's reader. in "forme et signification", jean rousset explains that, in proust's, the readers of balzac, who are swann and charlus, are unable of any artistic creation, because they're stuck in reality, which they mistake with art. they see reality in art and "are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work, between reality and art". and that's exactly alexandre. he claims for instance that he "loves a woman for parallel reasons, because she played in a bresson's for example". he's like swann, who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli's woman."life is perhaps not my vocation". this thought is indeed by eustache, who committed suicide, even if it's said by alexandre. nevertheless, there is a difference between alexandre and eustache : if eustache is absolutely alexandre, alexandre is like a double without art, a horrible vision of the artist, which crystallizes his fears.by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie, alexandre is condemned to illusions. it's death that remind me the last frames of the movie, in the face of jean-pierre léaud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika. or maybe it is already hell that describes the end, like in sarte's "huit-clot", and absolutely not like in the final liberation of "le temps retrouvé". if eustache had read proust, alexandre could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafés. "la maman et la putain" is like a inverse double of "in search of lost times", which tells how alexander doesn't become an artist, whereas "a la recherche du temps perdu" tells how marcel becomes a writer (genette).if, like baudelaire says, an artiste tells "reality at the light of his dream", it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in "la maman et la putain".

in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual "revolution" (purposefully i use quotations for that word), jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who can't seem to get enough love. if there is a message to this film- and i'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben-hur length feature has to offer- it's that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth. is it possible to have two lovers? some can try, but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want, or feel they can even express to say what they want? what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre (jean-pierre leaud) has with the women around him? he's a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual, not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman, marie (bernadette lafont) slightly older than him and is usually, if not always, his lover, his last possible love-of-his-life left him, and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street, veronika (françoise lebrun), who perhaps reminds him of her. soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film, where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures. at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre, but we're mistaken. the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around, talking on and on, for something to sink in.we're told that part of the sexual revolution, in theory if not entirely in practice (perhaps it was, i can't say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand), was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions. but eustache's point, if not entirely message, is that it's practically impossible to have it both ways: you can't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with "f***ing", as the characters refer over and over again. the mother and the whore's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity, the lack of monogamy, while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you've ever seen in a movie. at the same time we see a character like alexandre, who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past, eustache makes it so that the film itself isn't pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that it's about pretentiousness, what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws, what they need to use when they're ultimately alone in the morning. if you thought films like before sunrise/sunset were talky relationship flicks, you haven't met this. but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have, sometimes trivial, or 'deep', or sexual, or frank, or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional, it's never, ever uninteresting or boring. on the contrary, for those who can't get enough of a *good* talky film, it's exceptional. while his style doesn't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand, eustache's new-wave touch is with the characters, and then reverberating on them.this is realism with a spike of attitude, with things at time scathing and sarcastic, crude and without shame in expression. all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can't ever perceive them as 'faking' an emotion or going at all into melodrama. it's almost too good in naturalistic/realism terms, but for eustache's material there is no other way around it. luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period, and both ladies, particularly labrun as the "whore" veronika (a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film's climax of sorts in one unbroken shot). and, as another touch, every so often, the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought, of a character sitting by themselves, listening to a record, and in contemplation or quiet agony. this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch, who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late parisian.sad to say, before i saw broken flowers, i never heard of eustache or this film, and procuring it has become quite a challenge (not available on us dvd, and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries). not a minute of that time was wasted; the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work, one of the best of french relationship dramas, maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i've seen from the country in general. it's complex, it's sweet, it's cold, it's absorbing, and it's very long, perhaps too long. it's also satisfying on the kind of level that i'd compare to scenes from a marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film's release.

unfortunately, jean eustache (1938-1981) belongs like so many once leading french film makers nowadays to the great unknown ones whose movies are hard to find and are not released on international dvds. since we have a good old-fashioned video-store in tucson, i had the chance to watch this 3 1/2-hour marathon masterwork that is not boring for ten seconds.since we speak here about one of the most discussed (and most controversially discussed) movies of all times, let me tell you my impression that the endless dialogs, originally typical for the early "nouvelle vague" of a jacques rivette or alain resnais appear almost ridiculous in this movie. the dialogs are basically monologues, mainly the longest ones spoken by jean-pierre léaud. the most characteristic feature is that the intersections of the speeches of two people is almost zero. léaud, or his character, alexandre, pleases to tell more about himself than about the topics he is seemingly to speak. therefore, one can hardly speak about communication in this movie. it is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of man alexandre exists to all times, we find him already in petron's "satiricon", which work has actually great resemblance with "the mother and the whore".alexandre does not only nothing, but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting, at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is. he mocks at the people who run to work at 7 c'clock in the morning, when he is just busy having his last drink before he goes to bed in the apartment of one of his girlfriends from whose money he lives. he is unable to speak one sentence without quoting one of the leading thinkers between nietzsche and bernanos. especially sartre who is shown quickly in the french intellectual café "aux deux magots", where alexandre, too, is sitting all day, must serve as excuse for the life-style of alexandre and his colleagues, because they suffer existential crisis from bourgeois nausea. however, the intellectual speeches of alexandre seem to be rather pseudo-intellectual, and the sentences and quips he cites seem to come rather from a dictionary of quotations than from his actual reading of the respective books.it is true: this movie demands an extremely broad european knowledge, especially the connoisseurship of french existentialist philosophy and there consequences to the 68 student revolution movement, but if you have this knowledge, than you will enjoy 215 minutes of your life by staring amazed into the tv and crying out with laughing like you have probably not done it since a long time.

of all the reviews i've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on alexandre. neither marie or veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep alexandre, he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't think so. though french new wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in alexandre's position, in an urban area can ask for. i'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?

la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released (post-68) and eternal in many respects. true, the actors don't "act" ... true, they talk a lot... but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living... or dying. the very long monologue spoken by françoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood, manhood and love. not easy to translate accurately, though. this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). and imho, jean pierre léaud is one of the greatest french actors.

the movie has very much the feel of a play right from the start - i think it would make a better play than a movie because the set and dramatization make a movie version seem a bit too artificial. but, still, it's carried out fairly well, and the story & especially the dialogue are interesting. they've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play. perhaps it's a good introduction to shaw's plays.the main character raina has her head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic, and helena bonham carter's acting does a good job here. her fiancé, serges, is a bit too cartoonish when he is really supposed to be an extremely handsome dashing figure. her parents are entertaining enough.

this could be difficult to for some people to get into, being used to hollywood production styles. the directing is uninspired, apparently simply a filming of the stage set-up, and the audio quality is bad here and there (the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices, etc.).my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost put us off. it seemed very stagy and cheesy. then we picked up on the tone of the content, and really started to enjoy ourselves.it is very funny, despite some corniness. definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog. also, helena bonham carter is adorable, of course.

'arms and the man' is one of shaw's funniest plays if handled correctly, and this production does a good enough job. helena bonham-carter, pre-film stardom, is raina, the daughter of a military family, who has a peacock of a fiancé (patrick ryecart), and who shelters a soldier from the enemy (pip torrens) during a raid on the town.full of colour and energy, this production rips along at a good pace, and if bonham-carter and patsy kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast, they still hold their ground. kika markham and dinsdale landen as the parents are delightful, and the whole play is generally a happy one.highly recommended.

comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth. arms and the man, proves that notion to be false. shaw's play is full of comedic drama, combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth.on one level, arms and the man is a successful, and somewhat unique, romantic comedy. the young, melodramatic, and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war; her fiancé and her father are both military officers. she is shocked, one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier. she rescues him, knowing that she'll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever, and the soldier eventually leaves. of course, once the war is over, that soldier comes back, forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships.it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot. shaw manages to comment on class constructs, on the absurdity of war, and even on the nature of love. and, of course, he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot. there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing. arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw's best works."arms and the man" is both an amusing and thought-provoking movie that retains its relevance even today, more than a century after it was first conceived. shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure. the play has flashing wit, buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms. a good example of shaw's dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis: "i'm a professional soldier: i fight when i have to, and am very glad to get out of it when i haven't to. you're only an amateur; you think fighting is an amusement". indeed as a swiss hotel-keeper's son, bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments. shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different.the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending. the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy. this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically. shaw's "arms and the man" should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war.

with few exceptions, most of george bernard shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater these days. too arch, too talky appears to be the general verdict. this bbc version of one of shaw's funniest plays doesn't refute that verdict. it is certainly arch and talky, but it is also wonderful. and because of the quality of british theater, it is perfectly cast with actors whom -- with the exception of helena bonham carter -- most of us have probably never heard of. carter is splendid as the bulgarian girl who shelters the professional "chocolate soldier" (pip torrens) and later falls in love with him. one might quarrel with the especially ridiculous interpretation of sergius (patrick ryecart), the bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge into the enemy's lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for its machine guns. however, the role invites over-acting and ryecart was obviously told to over-act. the other players are letter perfect. carter as the self-dramatizing bulgarian "aristocrat" and torrens as the swiss soldier-of-fortune are at the play's center, of course, and they are wonderful. yes, "arms and the man" comes across as a filmed play. but you're unlikely ever to see a shaw film that doesn't betray its origin. the plots are generally clever. however, shaw is all about the dialog. the action is minimal (even in st. joan) and the sets are immaterial. enjoy this for what it is.

ironically for a play unavailable on film or video for so long, arms and the man has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894 - in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the business of war. whenever the world sinks into strife, arms and the man seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant.this is the play which oscar strauss converted (leaving out most of shaw's best ideas) into the successful operetta, the chocolate soldier (when hollywood got to *that,* they left out the last vestiges of shaw rather than pay him for the rights - he was, by then, an oscar winner in his own right). while the best of shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots, in arms and the man, the plot sparkles as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned. young raina (helena bonham carter), daughter of an officer and the wealthiest man in her town, is betrothed to a dashing officer in the bulgarian cavalry and all seems well until a bedraggled swiss mercenary (pip torrens) from the other side climbs up her drainpipe fleeing from the battle where his army has been routed. as usual in a shaw satire, nothing is as it first appears and societal conventions are stood on their head in the light of simple - and not so simple reason. there are no "good guys" or "bad guys," just people of a variety of classes getting by on the best of their wits - just like life only better - and naturally with shaw, the wit is finely honed from all concerned.the early (1932) motion picture version (from shaw's own screenplay) of this most traditional and traditionally funny of shaw's stage satires, and one of his first to make a real hit on this side of the atlantic, has long been among the missing. shaw didn't sell the screen-rights to his plays - only licensed them for 5 year periods, and it appeared that with rapidly evolving sound technology making 1932 films look primitive only a few years later, shaw did not renew the license to show it. consequently, we're immensely in the bbc's debt for finally putting out their 1987 broadcast version in a dvd box with nine other sparkling plays. (somewhat sadly, pygmalion, that many view as shaw's best, comes off least well on this set in a production with lynn redgrave and james villiers.)even paired, as it is on its dvd, with the less impressive one act, a man of destiny, arms and the man makes for a real treasure.helena bonham carter went on, after cutting her teeth on televised roles like this, to a major film career that will bring many viewers to this early role. they should not be disappointed, for ms. carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her, but under james cellan jones' somewhat pedestrian direction (and despite the bbc's uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production), the role's mischievous fire (and her outrage at being underestimated in the last act) is banked at only about 80% of it's potential. much the same can be said of the real star of the piece, pip torrens, as bluntschli the "switzer." it's a fine, appealing performance, but doesn't go for the physical comedy implicit in the early scene where the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal peril.these reservations notwithstanding, this is a solid production of a wonderful play transferred to the small screen with aplomb. it deserves to be seen widely and, ideally, prompt an even livelier big screen remake with the style and zest of the recent remake of wilde's an ideal husband. virtually *any* arms and the man is to be cherished, and with a lot of luck perhaps we'll even eventually get to see the original 1932 version. 'till one or the other surfaces, this production will please anyone who loves good shaw.

it is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations. yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the very greatest films of all time.the film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (if you want something uplifting, see jacques rivette's fantastic céline and julie go boating, which was made around the same time). it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.it involves a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between alexandre (played by jean-pierre leaud), marie (bernadette lafont) and veronika (francoise lebrun). yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave. this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. jean-pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential les quatres cent coups (1959) by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager. director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave, but he should be.there is no improvisation (unlike in john cassavetes's similar films made in the us) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. the film is resonant with eustache's personal experiences. for example, francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache. eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character marie was based on, did too. the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. this mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.

one of the last classics of the french new wave. for direction, cineaste jean eustache drew from the simplicity of early-century cinema; for story, eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life. so many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant; self indulgently overlong; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining...etc. etc. in my mind, whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths. every film student, writer, or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts, no music video overstyling, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie. everything is to be admired: the writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone, quite simply, is perfect in their respective roles), and, simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film) make this film unforgettable. this is undoubtedly a film that stays with you.

unlike another user who said this movie sucked (and that olivia hussey was terrible), i disagree.this movie was amazing!!!!!! olivia hussey is awesome in everything she's in! yeah she may be older now, because many remember her from romeo and juliet, but she's wonderful! this story line may be used quite often, but it's a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who disagrees! i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie. olivia's "my girl" and i love her work.i saw this for the first time on saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. not only because's it's an olivia movie, but because of it's unique story line and wonderful direction.

(no spoilers, just plot details) i can't understand such hatred for this episode. you want to watch a bad episode of smallville? watch subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. tom welling gives a good performance (i don't say that very often), and michael rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. the martian manhunter, who previously appeared in "static", returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone, and if clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. an overall great episode, with good acting and a decent pace.

this episode is a bit confusing. some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginning!clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of fairview mental institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero. clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head. delusional. he also find some things that are unusual: martha's married to lionel; lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and lana is devoted to clark. but he finds one familiarity; someone else who's devoted to clark: chloe. he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of smallville. and the doctor is an escapee from the phantom zone.this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called "normal again" where buffy begins to have vivid-daydreams about a mental asylum. the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy. her parents were still married, they still lived in la, her friends didn't exist, angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called dawn. demons and vampires also didn't exist. both episodes are a bit sad because doctors aren't just telling the characters that it's all a figment of her imagination but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. it's nice, though, to have a sense of reality every once in a while, but we watch these shows to escape from reality. it's again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges.

though derivative, "labyrinth" still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor. it's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of "truth, justice, and the american way" on a weekly basis with very little variation. his performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie, was quite believable.welling rose to the occasion marvelously.as always, michael rosenbaum, as the "handicapped" lex, delivered, as did kristen kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed lana. allison mack, the ever-present chloe, also scored as a slightly "off-her-rocker" version.the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama.

while in the barn of kent farm with shelby waiting for chloe, clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with dr. hudson. the psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional, believing that he has come from krypton and had superpowers. clark succeeds to escape, and meets lana, martha and lex that confirm the words of dr. hudson. only chloe believe on his words, but she is also considered insane. clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and origin."labyrinth" is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of "smallville". the writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from krypton. the annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "labirinto" ("labyrinth")

you better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to clark's life.yet, that is the twist; clark is stuck in an alternate reality. lana is devoted to him. lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss clark in the pilot of the series. martha is married to lionel. about the only constant is his most loyal friend chloe, who still believes in who he is. and, oh yeah, he doesn't have any superpowers. he is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers, and is ridiculed for believing so. aside from chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in clark: a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution, who believes he is from mars.clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality, and not get brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is in fact the fourth phantom zone escapee.this episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking. plus, it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of "smallville" episode.

in one of her first movies, romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain, as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of 18, learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians, and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony. kitschy and campy (though surprisingly faithful to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm. on that front, one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen; but then one remembers that in 1954, austria was still under occupation by allied troops, including british ones. maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film.

don't let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic. this movie was shot in a lower budget ,probably against the will of ernest marishka, so he had to make due.for example england is portrayed as bordering on germany.by a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alone.they arrived their too quick. this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented, for the movie, was austrian. when she's told that she's queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her, where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen? why isbn't she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects ?low budget!where the audience back then aware of these imperfection? i wonder how the critics felt?durring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbn't excited about it. durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like " my old kentucky home" , and "old black joe". what? civil war songs in the 1830's? is romy schneider being portrayed as scarlet?where's mammy? is magna shnieder playing her too? is adrian hoven rhett or ashley? what was in marishka mind?well this add to the camp.it's unintentionally satirizing queen victoria'a story. this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected

i loved this movie. it was so well done! great acting and drama and historically accurate. i love romy schneider movies. this one rocks, not as great as sissi but still rocks! and scorpiolina,she commented and said french dubbing. well this is originally a german movie not french. so yea. second of all there was a plot, maybe your not familiar with history. oh and her mother played the part of her governess, not her teacher. and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria, maybe u missed that detail.but anyway.... yea the history in this movie is great, i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating! i love all the historical stuff. like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom. and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the "new type of dance" waltzing. when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close. yea her governess was like oh my god!and also the clothes, i love the clothes. the styles are great, hoop skirts are awesome. and of course romy always looks very pretty.

ernst marischka, one of the most respected austrian directors of that time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and with respect to all that is precious in life. nowadays, if people should hear about him, they associate the name of marischka with sissi trilogy (1955,1956,1957). however, he made other excellent films like das dreimaderlhaus (1958), embezzled heaven (1958) and definitely this one, madchenjahre einer konigin showing the young years of queen victoria. although it deals with a slightly different theme than sissi films, i do not see many differences between this movie and sissi. they are strikingly similar.the movie is almost identical. the style, the music, the photography. in fact, the crew are almost the same. anton profes, bruno mondi!the cast... romy schneider's one of the first main roles. it was a lovely introduction to her role of sissi since this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy about the austrian empress. it is also a film where romy plays with her mother, magda schneider. but ernst marischka was not the first director who cast romy to play with her mum. romy's debut, wenn der weisse flieder wieder bluhn (1953) was her performance with her mother, too. therefore, there were some voices that romy began her austrian career on the bases of her mother's fame. indeed, there is some truth in it.again, like in sissi, this film shows love very gently. victoria meets prince albert in a little inn in dover. their sympathy is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. and now...? what would it be showed like? only sex... but is it the only thing love is based on?i am grateful to ernst marischka for these movies. they had a soul and a message. some people may call them kitschy, but i will never give up admiring these films. they are impressive!!! unfortunately, highly underrated!

"once upon a time there was a charming land called france.... people lived happily then. the women were easy and the men indulged in their favorite pastime: war, the only recreation of kings which the people could enjoy." the war in question was the seven year's war, and when it was noticed that there were more corpses of soldiers than soldiers, recruiters were sent out to replenish the ranks. and so it was that fanfan (gerard philipe), caught tumbling a farmer's daughter in a pile of hay, escapes marriage by enlisting in the regiment d'aquitane...but only by first believing his future as foretold by a gypsy, that he will win fame and fortune in his majesty's uniform and will marry the king's daughter. alas, adeline (gina lollobrigida) is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiment's recruiting sergeant. when fanfan charges away from the recruits, saber in hand to rescue a carriage under attack, who should be inside but the marquise du pompadour and...the king's daughter. he now is convinced he will marry high, despite the extremely low-cut blouses adeline wears. she, in turn, will soon discover her own love for fanfan. we're in the middle of an irreverent movie of fanfan's destiny, the ribald adventures of a sword-fighting scamp and rogue. there are escapes from hangings, swordfights on tile roofs, blundering battles, romantic escapes and more joyous derring do than you can imagine. what fanfan lacks in polish he makes up for in irreverence and enthusiasm. he's a quick stepping swordsman and a fast-talking lover, but with such naïve belief in his destiny and such an optimistic nature, how can we not like him? gerard philipe was an iconic stage and screen actor (who francois truffaut disparaged constantly in the pages of cahiers du cinema). he did most of his own stunts. he was handsome, athletic, graceful and charismatic. men admired him and women dreamed about him. he was dead at 36, seven years after fanfan, of liver cancer. all of france mourned. gina lollobrigida as adeline holds her own. it's not those low-cut blouses that do her acting. she's sharp, passionate, not quite innocent and no one's fool. fanfan la tulipe just sings along with endless satiric action, pointed situations and good nature. not to mention amusing, acerbic dialogue. after adeline has taken steps to save fanfan from hanging, she meets the king in his private quarters. "give me your pretty little hand," he says. "but my heart belongs to fanfan," says adeline. "who asks for your heart?" says the king, "all i ask for is a little pleasure." "i'm a proper girl," says adeline. says the king, "you owe my esteem to your merits. you love fanfan? then thank me. my whims enable you to show the greatest proof of your love, by betraying for his sake the loyalty you have sworn him." now this is clever, funny stuff. jean-luc godard, francois truffaut and the rest of the new wave gang tended to detest popular movies as mere entertainment (and they personalized their attacks). fanfan la tulipe and its director, christian-jacques, were among their prime targets. they probably missed the point of fanfan, which is a very funny satire on the pointlessness of armies and war. how much better it must have seemed to make movies of angst which only fellow cineastes could appreciate. thank goodness some of them, truffaut and chabrol, for example, outgrew this childish condescension and came to recognize that a good movie is a good movie, whether the masses like it or just the cognoscenti. a smart person who enjoys movies can appreciate any, if the movies are well made. those who condescend to a movie based on its degree of popularity are as self-demeaning as those who brag they've never read harry potter. jean-luc godard, eat your heart out. viva fanfan!

the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago. i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional, aimed at a long obsolete target. hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all, basil rathbone, crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire. after a while you don't notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda, both versions. gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it.

gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, tender, brave and lover.he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece, as much by the other actors (gina lollobrigida:miaoooou!!) as by the story or the rhythm. never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best french movie of all time.

the men can slaver over lollo, if they like (or her lollos--she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french), but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple, dashing story of love and war, in which all is fair, they are not needed. all you need know is that, at the beginning of the film, lollobrigida reads philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king. thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running, jumping, and swordplay.on the minus side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying, and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts. and of course the non-french-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la, such as: virtuous girl: i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan. seducer: my dear, what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle?

i remember this movie from the 50s when i was in college. it is one of the funniest satires of american westerns that i have ever seen. i'm only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd. it is a real treat.

this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired the black tulip (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good), the surprisingly effective lady oscar (1979; which had originated as a japanese manga!) and the splendid cartouche (1962). actually, i had watched this one not too long ago on late-night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it, so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion).incidentally, fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned cartouche: not just cast and crew members (producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine, cinematographer christian matras, actor noel roquevert) but plot-wise as well  in fact, the hero is a womanizing soldier (jean-paul belmondo's cartouche had also had a brief military spell) who's loved by a fiery girl (in this case, gypsy gina lollobrigida) while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love (here, it's none other than the king's daughter)! as in the later film, too, fanfan (an ideally cast gerard philipe who, ironically, is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing roquevert, with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record, lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film, rene clair's delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit (1952).fanfan proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris (1951), detective story (1951), othello, umberto d. and viva zapata! in fact, its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title, there's also the dubious choice of an english-dubbed soundtrack but, even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering, when all is said and done, there's simply no substitute for the original! fanfan la tulipe (a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming, i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and, on the whole, this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski's equally droll the adventures of gerard (1970). that said, the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now; the climax, then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who, amusingly, are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone, much to the king's amazement who, as portrayed by marcel herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne''s children of paradise (1945)  is himself something of a lecher.p.s. an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian-jaque's promising champagne for savages (1964) for months now but, despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week), they have yet to show it; even so, i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile (equally culled from late-night italian tv screenings): the three-hour epic la chartreuse de parme (1948; also starring gerard philippe), the second twin (1967) and the legend of frenchie king (1971; with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale).

it was released in france on dvd several years ago--i wish it would be re-released with english subtitles. do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews. gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. he sets off to join the army and goes to war. his love, however, is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her. i won't spoil the end. gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.

this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe. portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry king louis xv's daughter! problem is, la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan...propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought. look out for noel roquevert, a traditional heavy in french films, trying to steal la lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo's hand! and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven king louis xv! that is not all: so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952! the film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! do see it!

the superb star quality of gerard philipe, who died way too young, leaps from the screen in this witty, funny, sly swashbuckling comedy with plenty of sword fencing and knockabout antics. charmingly loopy in its' storytelling, impossible to resist. a sweet romantic comedy with a very young gina lollobrigida as the love interest. a movie one will remember with great affection.

"fanfan la tulipe" is still gerard philippe's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the french cinema in the 1955-1965 years.it made gina lollobrigida a star (lollobrigida and philippe would team up again in rené clair"s "belles de nuit" the same year."fanfan la tulipe" is completely mad,sometimes verging on absurd .henri jeanson's witty lines -full of dark irony- were probably influenced by voltaire and "candide" .antimilitarism often comes to the fore:"these draftees radiate joie de vivre -and joie de mourir when necessary (joy of life and joy of death)""it becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors" "you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me, king louis xv complains,but no matter ,let's wait for the next time."a voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride:height of irony,it's a genuine historian who speaks!christian-jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo :accelerated.remake in 2003 with vincent perez and penelope cruz.i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place.

this is one fine movie, i can watch it any time. rauol julia gave an outstanding performance, we lost him too soon. richard dryfus is a great talent. only thing it needed more of was dana delany, what a babe!

this is a modest, character driven comedy, filmed in brazil on a low budget. the premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950's danny kaye movie **on the double**: someone who, as a joke, does an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real.the contrast between the two leads is highly effective. raul julia as the german-paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cool, menacing and latin. he sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. richard dreyfus, animated, short, new york jewish, is funny and sympathetic. there are many references and inside jokes about show business.the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay. paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen. alfredo stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from germany. but writer/director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints parador/paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny, with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. further in this vein, mazursky casts comic jonathan winters as an american retiree who in truth is c.i.a. station chief in parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out. in fact the u.s. has little influence in paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. this is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. on yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna. played by brazilian actress sonia braga, madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end--now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept to office by a velvet revolution.the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america, the administration of argentina's isabel peron (not the beloved evita, who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary **supremo** juan peron.

this little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites. i can watch it over and over. dreyfus and braga are masterful, but raul julia steals the show! a tongue-in-cheek, menacingly humorous gomez addams, with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story.generally untrumpeted and unappreciated, moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen. two thumbs up!

this is one the few movies i can watch over and over. if you've never seen it, give it a shot. richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly, it reminds me of julia's untimely demise. it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear.

i thought that mr. dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator. his co-star, mr. julia, played his role equally as perfect. it was interesting to see how reluctant richard dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will. but he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed. since everything happens for a reason in life, i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did. i'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in parador. i think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did.but........... anyways........... this is why i gave this film a 7 out of 10.

i enjoyed this film. it was funny, cute, silly, and entertaining. had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly don't understand. no, it wasn't "the grapes of wrath" or "casablanca" or even "moonstruck", but it was an enjoyable film.julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'. the story is a little silly to be sure, but it this isn't high drama, folks. i happened to see a review of the film, probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie. i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it, and i'm glad i saw it. eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile, and i watch it a couple times a year.

this movie is fun to watch. if you liked "dave" with kevin klein, you will get a kick out of this. think "dave" gone south american as dreyfus plays jack noah, an actor between jobs, who is hand selected by the head of the island nation of parador's secret police, to replace the drunken sot of a dictator, alfonse simms, after he has had a heart attack and died. noah bumbles along, aided in his role by the ex-dictator's mistress, as they attempt to thwart the plans of raul julia. jonathan winters also makes an appearance as a hearty american émigré who turns out to be cia. also starring polly holiday and fernando rey. there are a few absurd moments such as the body of the old dictator be kept frozen for a year, and the final scene, where sonia braga, who has bee cradling the bloody, bullet riddled body of dreyfus is seen moments later all in pristine white, with nary a smudge on her. but all in all it is a great romp.

richard dreyfuss stars in "moon over parador," a 1988 paul mazursky film also starring raul julia, sonia braga, jonathan winters and charo. dreyfuss plays a new york actor, jonathan nolan, in the caribbean country of parador to make a film. when the dictator dies suddenly, the secret police chief (julia) who is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country, drafts jonathan to play the dictator, having noticed the resemblance between them. soon jonathan is ensconced in the palace as alphonse simms, and simms' prostitute girlfriend madonna (braga) who realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can.mazursky, who appears in drag as simms' mother, gives us a look at how the cia operates in third world countries. the winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a cia operative. the film, however, flirts with but doesn't really tread on very serious ground and is more of a send-up, and a funny one at that.richard dreyfuss does a fabulous job as jonathan the actor and alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing both. the gorgeous sonia braga is great as madonna, and raul julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as strausmann, the man behind the dictator. it's one of those performances where you never quite know what the character is thinking - he can be pleasant or turn psycho at any moment. charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time.a very good film, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.

... and if you're very, very good it will resemble moon over parador.this film had a slightly silly story, but it was a fantasy after all, and the casting and the acting was spot-on! dreyfuss was perfect as the actor/impostor, full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have. you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes.this was one of dreyfuss's best roles, just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator! and the parting scene: like something out of casablanca, indeed! raul julia was superb as the paradorian chief of secret police. he gets some really funny lines, some of which are homages to other films, like "round up the usual suspects!" and sonia braga was excellent as the girl friend -- in addition to being a really hot number: "you should get an oscar for tonight!" let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves: sammy davis jr., ike pappas, dick cavett -- all perfectly done.all in all, a memorable romp under the paradorian moon.-r.

paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made dave. it's the same story, not as funny though.paul related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national anthem of parador. he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas, three planes, car ride to the set, etc. he was beat. he could hardly stand, had to use a cane. he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom.he didn't know he could do it. then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras,paid 7 bucks. he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours. he was magnificent, then nearly collapsed.paul is a great guy, though very liberal. a real talent.

while "the kiss of the spider woman" cast raul julia as a political prisoner in an unidentified latin american country, this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country. specifically, the dictator suddenly drops dead, so julia replaces el presidente with a broadway actor (richard dreyfuss) shooting a movie in the country. from there, dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator, all the while balancing it with his own life.is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy? well, "moon over parador" does a good job with it. no matter what they do in this movie, they pull it off. it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era, and what we lost when raul julia died. definitely worth seeing. also starring sonia braga (who co-starred with raul julia in "tkotsw"), jonathan winters and sammy davis jr.i agree: the first lady is hot.

superb comic farce from paul mazursky, richard dreyfuss, plays jack noah a fairly successful actor- who is on location shooting a film in a fictitious latin american banana republic parador,ruled by the fascist, alfonse sims who unfortunately has succumbed of a heart attack after indulging in too many local cocktails! raul julia plays the oily chief of police who forces the reluctant noah to impersonate the just deceased dictator who noah bears a remarkable resemblance, sonia braga plays the dictator's glamorously lusty mistress, who gives noah a few lessons in how to 'act' like a dictator, jonathan winter's literally rounds off the cast as a cia man in parador posing as a hammock salesman. can noah win over the people of parador? and hold off the rebels? and give the performance of a lifetime without losing his in the process? sammy davis jnr,has a cameo as himself who amusingly croons the national anthem of parador as well as begin the beguine, frog number one(fernando rey pops up as a kindly servant, charo is also on hand as a busty maid, the score by maurice jarre,is excellent.

as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn't take acting too seriously, i'm always amused by those who treat it as great art. this movie skewers the "actor's craft" mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs.a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "the part of a lifetime" by the neo-nazi head of the secret service. he plays it to the hilt, gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables on his captors beautifully.lots of great shtick by the leads, lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors, particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameos abound. sammy davis jr. makes light of himself, jonathan winters plays a semi-retired american businessman with something else going on, and raul julia, sonia braga, and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional.this is a dumb movie, but it has lots of beautiful locations (in brazil), a humorous script, and good actors doing their thing and looking like they're actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play-acting!

this movie contains one of richard dreyfuss's greatest performances, as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. also, this movie is funny, yet has a serious side as well. what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value. and the main character, who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon, evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect. i liked this movie.

textbook example of an underestimated movie.although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. and although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, moon over parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should. even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and raul julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.but after watching raul julia as roberto strausmann make richard dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! in fifty years we will have the proof.

in new york, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm matt saunders (luke wilson) meets jenny johnson (uma thurman) in the subway, he invites her to date and have dinner with him. jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero g-girl. after meeting his co-worker and friend hannah lewis (anna faris), the needy jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and matt follows the advice of his best friend vaughn haige (rainn wilson) and dumps her, breaking her heart. jenny turns matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with hannah. however, the archenemy of g-girl and former high school sweetheart of jenny, professor bedlam (eddie izzard), proposes matt to lure jenny to strip her superpowers."my super ex-girlfriend" is delightfully silly and funny. this romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot, anna farris is extremely sexy as usual, and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in "fatal attraction" or evelyn draper in "play misty for me". my vote is seven.title (brazil): "minha super ex-namorada" ("my super ex-girlfriend")

this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films. the concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" into this movie. so many lines and gags were left hanging too long, with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing. wilson, wilson, farris & thurman were great. wanda sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a dvd rental. also, i was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits, something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films, a la something about mary, meet the parents but again, i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. it felt like it was rushed into theaters.

this movie was one of the funniest movie i've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me. not since my big fat greek wedding (2002) has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense. easily has intricate as last year's mr. and mrs. smith (2005) in its use of parody (espionage in mr. and mrs. smith and sex in my super ex-girlfriend). director's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama, between crazy and downright ludicrous is great. never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy. at the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance. in some ways, it's so evident that it's great to see how it plays out. just like in real life, sometimes the truth is so evident that one can't really see it. easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie (1982). possibly a nine (depends on how it appears on a second viewing).

my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride. the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba. uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend. she was just simply fabulous!!! luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good (a lot better than in the scary movie franchise).ivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well. this film is clearly a 10/10 for it's cast (uma thurman), it's director, it's screenplay and from it's original plot line. this film is very highly recommended.

i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute. it had all the "sex" content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra, chemistry. uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . both seem to create this odd, twisted and interesting relationship with powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody, but i have to say i went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. this movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say adult for younger viewers. all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie, tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*)

my super ex-girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less. the story is quiet simple. matt saunders(luke wilson) meets jenny(uma thurman) on the subway and hooks up with her. in the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be ok, but then matt finds out that she's g-girl. at first that seems really cool to matt but it turns out that g-girl is very jealous and needy. so he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague hannah(anna faris). this makes g-girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend.what i liked most in the movie are the scenes where g-girl avenges herself on matt. it was also nice to see anna faris in another role then her character from the scary movie saga.i give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy.

of those comments here before mine, i mostly agree with edyarb's. the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny, but though managing at some points, in other places it failed. you could see them wanting to make a joke, but no one in the audience laughed. (also agree with edyarb's view on the end credits: leave it normal or make it cool, but not what they've done now.) ok, that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie. i enjoyed it; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket. the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature, like luke wilson's character matt asking the super chick "p*nis or bed?" when she told him she'd "get him a new one" after a wild night in bed, ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore.i cannot, however, agree with bgs1614,who says that the film could earn an 'r' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that. some sexual acts yes, but nothing explicit, only humorous, and no nudity whatsoever. (maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more...?) i'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever: superman returns and click. i didn't really expect anything from either one - i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic (which i wouldn't oppose) film. superman surprised me with actually having me feel good(goosebumps!) about seeing his first heroic deed, like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it. but for the rest of the story i'd rather watch my super ex-girlfriend, at least it offers some surprises. click again was a total surprise, much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie. the jokes also work much better than in ex-girlfriend, both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones.anyway, the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i've seen, within a very short period, and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all. i'd rank them click, girlfriend, superman.

well, this is an ivan reitman film. with the rare exception, ivan likes to entertain. his films generally aren't "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. my super ex-girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would. uma thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. i like luke wilson too, and rainn wilson was a straight hoot. never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. it's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. when you strip away the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. it's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. and in the end, the characters are looking for love. not all of them take being "dumped" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist.

a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. she refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. and there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. it can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.in short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. and imo, it succeeds at being a nice film. it's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.so. thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.7 out of 10 broken hearts

the title got my attention and then i wondered what will come out in the plot, as we have seen so many "super-people" movies these years... and in fact, i really liked it, as there were a number of unusual funny scenes that i didn't expect. uma thurman performed as average in g-girl's role. surprisingly, i was again able to watch her toes in wide screen (like in the beginning of kill bill). luke wilson however played very well the idiot everyday guy who meets the big woman, i could really get into his situation. if you want a light touch of fun, you should definitely watch g-girl's and average matt's adventures, especially to cheer up your partner. 7/10 in my collection.

my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? it was! but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of. i know that this was a very cheesy movie, but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work.jenny johnson(scary, that's my best friend's actual name) is not your typical average librarian looking woman, when matt, your average male, asks her out, he's in for more than he expected, he's asked g-girl out on a date, the super hero of the world! but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart, but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl, hannah, and she will make his life a living hell, i mean, let's face it, he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with.the effect were corny, but you seriously move past them quickly, the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie, it was such a step up from prime. my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it, anyone could.7/10

a big surprise, probably because i was expecting it to suck. the reviews were pretty dismissive of it, even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden: a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero, and finds, when he wants to break up with her, that she's kind of a psycho. i kept expecting it to fall apart, but it never really did. sure, it doesn't make as much of its awesome premise as it could, and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe. but i can't blame it for that. uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero, g-girl. and i've discovered, after several years of disliking him, that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub. he's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy). i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex. it's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. my only real complaint is that they make g-girl a bit too much of a psycho, like almost unbelievably so. maybe with some background i could have accepted it better. i can forgive its flaws, though, because i had a really good time watching it. underrated, for sure.

on paper this looked like a great concept: average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator, who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis. however, director ivan reitman and writer don payne (of the "simpson's") almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl (played by striking uma thurman) come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson. the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders (luke wilson) following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty. jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like. matt replies, "she's kind of nutty" i think the intent was to have jenny (thurman) be this lonely young woman, who has no one in her life, isolated by her great physical powers. thurman does the best she can, but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac. luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend."my super ex-girlfriend" is also a victim of bad timing, coming on the tail end of "superman returns" which plays superhero straight up, so to speak. with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought "my super ex-girlfriend" was funny and enjoyed the movie. given that this is an ivan reitman movie, this could have been a lot better. reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it. first off, we all love the hero. here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable. this is surprising for uma thurman, who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence. in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird. shocking. because if there is a woman who can play a superhero, she is thurmanshe looks great. only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic, instead of caricature. although "my super ex" is not a straight superhero story, rather a romantic comedy of sorts, it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain. here we have professor bedlam aka barry (eddie izzard) who really is evil lite. he is no lex luthor. no plans for global domination. bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl, and expectedly it has to do with their shared past. what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl? luke wilson's matt is just "some dude" who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero. one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn (rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation). wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense, and this dilutes his likable charm. this does however work, in the comic sex scene with jenny. matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah (perky anna faris). so how does matt break up with g-girl? well, it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious.dramatic superhero movies work. romantic comedies with chemistry work. what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies. everyone loves the hero. however, hero nut job? maybe not. with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly. and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne. thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings. "my super ex-girlfriend" is fun and funny. though given all involved, the movie could have been super.

this movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent, clinging, needy, jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women?without spoiling the movie, i can safely assure you it does not, but there's great fun to be had along the way. uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, an uber-babe, mysteriously named g-girl, who unlike most in her sisterhood, is not *always* dedicated to truth, justice, and the american way. thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft, yet somehow still fetching, curator jenny. when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival, g-girl goes ballistic, and what follows is not pretty. it's funny, but it's not pretty ..it's a delightful premise, hell hath no fury like a super-heroine scorned, and those involved don't altogether carry it off, but it has its moments, and i think i'll get the dvd.i liked this movie ..

this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all. i know i've personally run into this many times. thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving. people, don't do it. an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause. personally, i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. if you care about your family, make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people. thanks for showing us the way.

one thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. the story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. the story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. all the characters were ok and wil smith did another good day at the office.there are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. the journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.a good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. i would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.

going into see seven pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think tim, who claims to be ben, is just a big asshole. all of this comes to an end when the "twist",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. basically tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to.the acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. rosario dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. other actors, such as woody harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. although the casting of the film was still good.this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. the movie, however, was still pretty good. nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. final thought seven pounds=seven stars.

seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas, an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. what you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds. there is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode. the guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a ford gt and saying "aw hell nah" as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. this is probably the main reason why i wasn't looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.the supporting cast were all grand too - rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.overall it is a weepy - but it isn't throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.i would give it 8/10. the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it.

although i didn't like stanley & iris tremendously as a film, i did admire the acting. jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie. i haven't always been a fan of fonda's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold. he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart. i wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment, but i will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere.

when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film - it clearly wasn't a reference to british currency, so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. will smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. it could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing.guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller-coaster ride - you know its going to be unpleasant. i wouldn't say the movie glorifies suicide; it delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom.it's also brimming with symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire tell-tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a 2nd act complication. absolutely masterful.yes it is very slow-paced, but i'm undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe. i didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have, but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand. saying all that though, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.

i have never commented on a film before. i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. i've read comments saying this movie stays with you. it does. it's been almost 24 hours and i am still completely affected. this movie left me questioning my own self. how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless. i loved this movie. i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end. i feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too. i so wanted ben and emily to be together, but in the end, they were, forever. if you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. just make sure you have no distractions. you'll want to see every nuance in this picture. one for my library.

will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! writer grant nieporte and italian director gabriele muccino come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (irs agent ben thomas) he played in this film. you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for emily, played by rosario dawson, who by the way was fantastic as usual. i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. woody harrelson also stars in this top notch film. i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points...all i can say is, watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas...i thank you will smith for another great film!!!

the emotional impact of this movie defies words. it is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it. who knew? i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, smith. his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, i'm not sure, but i view him differently now. seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. it is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.

will smith is one of the best actors of all time. i don't know how he does it. i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it. he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there. this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet. i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head. amazing and sad all at the same time. thanks again will. you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. you cannot miss a thing. make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. well worth the money that you will pay to watch it.. don't wait for it to come on tv.

when its dvd was released i came to market and bought it. and i think my money was on right way as i expected before buying it. awesome movie what else i can say for will smith, he's been an awesome actor like always whether in actions movies or serious. always he gives a record braking performance. i think this is the movie after august rush which makes a person cry while watching it. the way the director described the story was really awesome. his previous life and his new life in movie was correctly elaborated to the audience. even i could not find any fault in the story or the way they shoot it. i think its dvd should be a household because this will be really a nice thing for your collection. it is not the movie which needs pop-corns for enjoyment, this is the movie which let the audience learn a lesson. now what is the lesson you can see that while watching. and i advise those people who are movie critics please watch this if you could find any criticism about this movie then please talk to me.

haunted by a secret, ben thomas (will smith) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he doesn't know. once his plan is set, nothing will be able to stop him. at least that's what he thinks. but ben hadn't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she's the one who will end up transforming him. will smith is back again with director gabriele muccino, after the life inspiring movie "the pursuit of happiness". "seven pounds" is yet another life changing movie experience, which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration, tearful, but inspires you joyfully in the end. will smith, also is the producer again with some of the others. these movies are very realistic, which depicts a common man's life & his struggles through life. seven pounds might have took some time to gain it's actual momentum, but just after half an hour of the movie, the movie is all set to rule your heart. also, this movie has some twists revolving around, which lets the viewers keep guessing. director gabriele muccino once again is the winner all the way, with his emotional yet inspiring message. he makes all the characters of the movie very real, that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie. along with the director, will smith is yet another winner, with his superb acting skills. once again, the duo of the director & the actor works as a charm. also, there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well. rosario dawson, beauty with brains, that's what she can be called. she looks beautiful & does her part extremely well. barry pepper, gives a great support to the movie & woody harrelson does the same, although woody did not had much screen timing(would have been good if he had more). you won't forget this movie easily. watch this movie & change your life. top class cinema!

from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here. it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on. the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul. even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive. i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did. we could see in his face "second thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings. it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused. maybe that was the point of the film. i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice. this guy knows how to entertain an audience!

wow! what - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! i'm not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors. usually i don't like dramas. i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor......but this movie ! it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting...wow...it is stunning. this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like "the pursuit of happiness" (maybe also because i did not like the acting of will's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors, i saw him also last night in "the day the earth stood still" and i confirmed my sensation that jaden can't act). i don't want to write spoilers and so i don't talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love, death and other feelings which i don't like to watch in movies....but this movie is such a super great movie. if you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it

i thought this was a wonderful movie. it touches every fiber of a human being. the love in the film is very intense. i thought it was will's best performance to date. great directing. liked the editing. music was great. good use of flashback. this is the kind of movie everyone should go see. i hope people will get something wonderful from this. overall, excellent movie. i think hollywood should make more movies with substance. even action films can have a caring story. i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting. he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about. for me, i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. the outside world was suspended for a moment. it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. and with this me generation it was great to see something(someone) that cared about other people more than himself.

before i see on this film, i see a lot of comments, which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad...what i really want to point out is the acting on woody harrelson behalf, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he appears or even the intro, i was astonished by will smith's and woody harrelson "message" they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on.i am not a very sentimental person, i believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. but a act to show redemption, there is not many films that in my point of view can show this. this is one of them that can.i agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of "suicide" is a downfall, however i do not believe that is the "message" the film is trying to send, but "sacrifice". a bit to the extreme, but that is the message in my opinion.this film has potential. the acting it is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films... if you like drama this is a must go watch.

first, i did like this film. it was well acted by all.however, i don't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending. i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few "gotta-see" recommendations, but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (i won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) still, despite it seeming obvious, i kept watching. it was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.i don't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film. i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.will smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. he's energetic and believable in everything that i've seen him do. seven pounds is another fine performance.rosario dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen. i haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. excellent.a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.overall, i have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid.

although a tear jerker it is definitely a "feel good" movie. all the actors were excellent and will smith as always, does the job and does it well. i could go on but pick any ten of the "10" ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could. but, since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.and, this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.

featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "seven pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (the pursuit of happiness), a flick which i also loved. remember gabriele muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile. too bad i figured out will smith's scheme early on, i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.however, i still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith's and dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith's character could have a divine gift, and i understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. it's quite a versatile performance.lastly i can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. put this on your list.

wow...i don't know what to say. i just watched seven pounds. no one can make me cry like will smith. the man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion. this movie was skillfully and beautifully done. rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today. i would compare it to "pay it forward" and "crash" as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way. definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one. not usually one for a "bad ending" but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion, raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around. therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end. it is true to life that there aren't always happy endings. sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be. many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost. if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie!

ben thomas (smith) plays an irs agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise. what kind of irs agent is this?most of us have all heard the line by an irs agent, "hello, i'm from the irs. i'm here to help." our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says, "yeah, right."as you get further and further into this story, you cannot figure this guy out. he goes easy on those who are being audited. what is his motive? is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? he helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited, of course. hey, irs, are you listening? (kidding, just kidding)the pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on. intense, repeat intense, focus was on ben and stays there. the whole movie only works because of ben as we try to figure him out and i didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about, willis?). not reading the box before watching the dvd movie was the better way to go here. by the end of the movie i finally put it all together. well, it was obvious by then. and, yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mostly because of will smith. will smith should have been nominated for a best actor award. the rest of the cast were very good as well. yes, it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong. what's the message? believe me, you will won't need too many clues to figure it out. i didn't. violence: no. sex: yes, but nothing to get excited about. bland. nudity: no. language: no.

although i can understand the bad things someone has to say about this movie, i still found it to be absolutely amazing. it will touch you, and unless your a critic searching deep into the flaws and mishaps of every movie, or you just simply aren't touched by anything, it is worth seeing. don't come into the movie expecting anything, just have a box of tissues and an open mind. it is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. i think will smith, despite that he's yet again playing another lonely depressed individual, is amazing. i believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray feelings and emotions we all have at our worst/best experiences in such a way that it reaches out to you and makes you feel something. and that's exactly what this movie does. give it a chance.

you spend most of this two-hour film wondering "what's the story regarding the lead character?" will smith, as a low-key "ben thomas" will keep you guessing. the last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker....but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. until then, smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. you know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.all of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with rosario dawkins ("emily posa") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together.this is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho will smith film. in fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of smith throughout this story. it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. he looks like he's lost weight and is sick. smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness.like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits.

it all starts with a suicide. or is it a car crash? i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. this is one powerful movie; maybe that is because i'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. and this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness, so i'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. with all that, though, i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. smith's thomas has lists of names, one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give thema gift that could completely alter their circumstances. he calls an old childhood friend (barry pepper) and reminds him to do what it is he promised, to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. even in a role as small as pepper's, you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background, hanging above everyone's head. it is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. his breakdowns, whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions, show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.after that phone call, begins the journey to meet new people. thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk, trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. this progression takes many turns, from a "blind, vegan, meat salesman" that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient, unable to print her line of stationary, or even run with her great dane duke; to an abused and scared latino mother of two, too afraid to leave her boyfriend; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day, and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his "gift" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the irs. as he says, though, "he kind of stumbled into the job".smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. as a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. if that means he must yell and make fun of them, he must do it. at every step, though, you see the suffering in his eyes, the pain eating away at his soul, taking each step towards his fate, one as a saint of redemption, not only for those he wants to help, but for himself as well. it is an award-worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles, because, while they are fun, this guy is too good for them. the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyat least in my mind.the rest of the cast is stellar across the board. woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. elpidia carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. and rosario dawson shines as the "once hot" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.

seven pounds, this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the "i'm going to make you cry" films. one thing i can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. my only thing is, as moving as the story is, will smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? but nevertheless it's still a good movie. i do have to admit it made me cry, but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson, i absolutely love this girl, ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton, i knew this girl was going to go far. she's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. but her and will smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée. a year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, ben, an irs employee. six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly. after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. he finds george, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas. two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. she suggests connie tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. one night, after being beaten, connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. she takes her two children and moves in to their new home. having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. the first is ezra turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy. he then contacts emily posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. he spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer. he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, i would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. will smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. but i loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.7/10

*i mark where there are spoilers! overall comments: if you can take a serious movie, go see this. have an open mind and you will enjoy it. don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! the movie fits together nicely in the second half. i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens. i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when will was going around promoting the movie. he was great--spent a lot of time with the fans. thank you for the picture will! about will's performance: a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. this is not the case with will smith in this movie. i didn't picture the fresh prince (lol) when i was watching this movie. he was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role. he has grown immensely as an actor. i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performance.about his character: ben is very conflicted and tormented. he's sad...guilt-ridden...very determined, but very scared. very true to himself. his character has a lot of depth...and somehow, will managed to bring that to life.about emily (rosario): rosario did a nice job portraying emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes. maybe she's not the shining star will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. i think her character just did not have as much to work with as will's did.about the plot (no spoilers): i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it. i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. but when things eventually fit together, wow. surprisingly well written and well thought out. it's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.it actually takes a lot out of you to watch. in the theater i was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men. when you realize what ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment...******* minor spoilers***** which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed, though. i will mention some of it here (without trying to give a lot away).-the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room. at first, it makes no sense whatsoever. there was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.-i hated ben at the beginning of the movie. by the end of it, i loved him and hated him. that's how convincing will was. i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. why he was treating ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. wait it out though. everything in this movie: wait it out.-ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for. it's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. i think it's a little bit of both...i think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. i love his character. you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. you hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. nice job will.

deanna durbin, nan grey and barbara read are "three smart girls" in this universal film from 1936, which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences. it also stars ray milland, mischa auer, charles winninger, john king, binnie barnes and alice brady. it's a sweet story about three young women, now living in switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (winninger) is marrying again. not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to america, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. realizing that the intended, called "precious" (barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count. this is arranged by their father's accountant (king). the man he chooses is a full-time drunk (auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (milland). what a mess.this is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by auer, milland, barnes and brady. the young women are pretty and all do good work. the emphasis, of course, is on young durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. in fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. she sings a delightful "il bacio" in a police station.one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by charles winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. in fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.universal gives durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. ray milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna.

deanna durbin, then 14 and just under contract to mgm, made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with judy garland, a year younger, in the first film for both of them. louis b. mayer then decided he didn't need two competing young singers, placed his bet on garland and let durbin go. universal immediately signed durbin, rushed her into three smart girls and rewrote the screenplay to pump up her part. she's billed last, but with the typographic equivalent of neon lights around her name. universal was convinced durbin would be a smash, and they were right. three smart girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy, and durbin, 15 when the movie was released, carries it with aplomb. she's penny craig, and she and her older sisters, joan and kay, are determined to save their father, who had divorced their mother, from the clutches of an elegant gold digger with a fierce mother. they talk their way from switzerland, where they live, to new york city, where their father lives. they plan not just to break up their father's wedding but to reunite their father with their mother, who after ten years apart still loves the guy. is there any doubt that durbin will sing a song or two in her warm, luscious soprano? nope. is there any doubt the girls will succeed...with kay and joan finding love and matrimonial material along the way? nope, again. years later durbin was quoted as saying that she couldn't keep playing little miss fixit forever. she was right, of course, but in three smart girls, her first feature movie, she has little miss fixit down pat. durbin is funny, determined, resourceful, energetic and, of all things, natural. her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy -- a mix of farce, confusion, good intentions and cheerful avarice -- downright endearing. durbin carries the movie with ease. it's a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of binnie barnes as donna lyon, the woman with her hooks in penny's rich father, played by charles winninger, who was no slouch at stealing scenes, either. alice brady, who played the dithering matron in my man godfrey, plays donna lyons' mother, who is even more of a gold digger than her daughter. the last of the accomplished farceurs is ray milland as lord michael stuart, who through a contrived and amusing mix-up is mistaken for mischa auer. three smart girls holds up well as a light-weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix- ups. so does deanna durbin as a brand-new star, who with her huge success saved universal's bacon.

deanna durbin really did save universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio. by the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at universal eg milestone, browning and wyler had gone. only james whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him. deanna and judy garland appeared in a short "every sunday" and initially garland was suggested for the role of penny in "three smart girls". when garland was unavailable universal switched to durbin. initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. directed by henry koster the film had a european touch.the film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in "switzerland". the "three smart girls" of the title - three sisters, joan (nan grey), kay (barbara read) and penny (deanna durbin) are sailing with penny giving her glorious voice to "my heart is singing". all is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (binnie barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse (lucille watson) decide to go to new york and reunite him with their mother. lucille watson is best remembered for her role as robert taylor's stern mother in "waterloo bridge" (1941).donna is a gold-digger who, along with her scatty mother (alice brady), is determined to marry judson craig (charles winninger). for someone with no film experience deanna is wonderful as penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture. when she sings "someone to care for me" to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had. she also has one of the funniest lines in the film. when her father consoles her with "i'll take you to the zoo tomorrow", she replies "oh i can see enough monkeys around here"!!!with the help of bill evans (john king) they decide to hire a "count" (mischa auer)to romance donna. they arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up lord michael stuart (ray milland) is mistaken for the count and donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of australia!!!) the plan backfires as he falls for kay and donna wants to hasten her marriage to judson.penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away. she is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of "il bacio" (she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer.) everything ends happily with their mother (nella walker) sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count (mischa auer) and sails off to australia with him.highly recommended.

cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland (often seen running about in matching outfits) who want to get their parents back together (seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad) - so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls "precious". dad hasn't seen his daughters in ten years, they (oddly enough) don't seem to mind and think he's wonderful, and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother (alice brady), a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man. the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count, tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe. but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking ray milland, who goes along with the scheme 'cause he has a crush on sister kay.this film is enjoyable, light fare. barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty, ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here (though, unfortunately, is given little to do), alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is deanna durbin, a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny, who pretty much steals the show. with absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings several songs throughout the film, though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this. the plot in this film is a bit silly, but nevertheless, i found the film to be entertaining and fun.

this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in 1936, i remember him playing in a great film, "lost weekend". ray plays the role of michael stuart, who is a very rich banker. there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy. they hire a man to pose as a very rich count, his name is count ariszted, (misha auer) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture. deanna durbin, (penny craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard, the entire police department and convicts started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film. this is deanna durbin's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm.

although she is little known today, deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice. this 1937 was her first major film, and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered universal studios.three smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother. although the story is slight, the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch. durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality, and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger, alice brady, lucile watson, and mischa auer round out the cast. a an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s film.gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer

i'm surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did. although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak, if this film is any indication, they were almost polar opposites.while, in three smart girls, durbin plays an impulsive "little miss fixit," who, after some setbacks, manages to reunite her divorced parents, in its' semi-remake, three daring daughters, jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him, too. from the durbin and powell films i've seen, i'd say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers.as for durbin's performance in three smart girls, i find it completely winning, and most impressive. although it's clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna, watching the self-confident, knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall, and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes, you'd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction. given that this film, and durbin herself, were much publicized at the time as "universal's last chance," the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age, but you'd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen. although she's clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera (this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland, rooney, o'connor and jane powell), durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her, and, even here, in her first film, she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character, and though she's occasionally shrill, she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars, including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success.in short, like all great singing stars, durbin was much more than just a "beautiful voice." on the other hand, while durbin's pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument, the most remarkable thing about it, to me, was the way she is able to project her songs, without the slightest bit of affectation or "grandnes" that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons, grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the periodthe film is also delightful, heavily influenced by screwball comedy, it backs durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as charles winninger, binnie barnes, alice brady, ray milland and mischa auer. the story is light and entertaining. true, it's hardly "realistic," but why would anyone expect it to be? if you want :"realistic" rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will. on the other hand, if you're looking for a genuine, sweet, funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully, charismatic and gifted adolescent "lead," and terrific supporting players, this film won't let you down.

it has been said that deanna durbin invented teenagery. this first film was one of the best. the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna, a little beauty with a gorgeous voice, as the "miss fixit" in a family split by divorce. for plot summary, see other imdb entries, but quickly deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to america from switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying. with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sisters, good direction and editing, the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings. of deanna's three songs, only "il bacio" is from the classical repertoire, but when she sings it in that police station scene, the film's place in history is assured. at least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music. one of the many nice touches that occur throughout three smart girls is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck for a final glimpse of deanna as the cops hustle him by! one unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for durbin vehicles became locked into the "miss fixit" theme, which quickly became stale. deanna herself never did. her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. it seems to me that, like many another film personality, she substituted "naturalness" for the histrionic ability that she lacked. the ploy worked well for 21 feature films.

john garfield plays a marine who is blinded by a grenade while fighting on guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. he has all the stereotypical notions about blindness, and is sure he'll be a burden to everyone. the hospital staff and his fellow wounded marines can't get through to him. neither can his girl back home played by eleanor parker. he's stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self pity, and prejudices. it's a complex role that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance that keeps one watching in spite of the ever present syrupy melodrama. the best scenes are on guadalcanal, where he's in a machine gun nest trying to fend off the advancing japanese soldiers in a hellish looking night time battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees himself walking down a train platform with a white cane, dark glasses, and holding out a tin cup, all the while his girlfriend walks backward away from the camera.

***spoilers*** on of the first wwii movies coming out of hollywood that shows how the war effected those gi's, or in this case us marines, who fought in it.21 year old al schmid, john garfield, was just starting to live with a well paying job-earning some $40.00 a week-at the local steel mill and girl ruth hartley, elenore parker, whom he was about to marry when the japs spoiled everything for him, and millions of likewise young americans, by attacking the us pacific fleet at pearl harbor. doing his duty as an american citizen al immediately joined the us marine corps hoping to get back at the japs knowing, correctly as it was to turn out, that the marines would be the first american combat units to get a crack at them.al finally got his chance when his unit, the 1st marine division, landed on august 7, 1942 at guadalcanal in the far flung solomon islands to engage the japanese who were were in control of it. it was during the battle of the ilu river that al almost single handed stopped a massive japanese banzai attack holding off, with his machine gun, wave after wave of suicide attacks by the determined japs until help, or reinforcements, finally arrived. it was during the bloody fighting al was hit in the face by a jap grenade that ended up blinding him.now back in the states convalescing at a naval hospital al is faced with something far more harder to overcome then battling a battalion size attack of japanese or german soldiers. he's faced with a future where he'll never see again and having to depend on others to look after, or for, him!we get to see in the film "pride of the marines" al battle himself far harder then he did the japanese troops on guadalcanal in just coming to terms with his disability. not wanting anyone, especially his girlfriend ruth, to feel sorry for him al in fact is the one who feels sorry for himself more then anyone else in the movie. it's with the help of navy nurse virginia pfeiffer, rosemary decamp, and ruth together with his us marine buddy lee diamond, dane clark, that in the end gives al the courage to face his blindness with the same strength that he faced wave after wave of japanese troops on gudalcanal. a courage al thought he lost back in that god-forsaken island hell in the south pacific.based on the true story of us marine sergeant albert schmid "pride of the marines" showed what we were to expect from the tens of thousands of wounded us servicemen coming back from the war. we get to see how it in many ways was far more difficult for those fighting the war to adjust to a peacetime america when they left something, like in the case of al schmid, behind on the battlefield. al's battle with his personal demons was a lot harder then the japanese that he fought in that they were part of him and thus had to fight himself in order to overcome and eventually defeat them. despite the help that he got from both nurse virginia and his girlfriend ruth as well as his navy doctor-who has a striking resemblance to actor gregory peck-it still was up to al to overcome the fears that he faced. fears which he and only he had to both battle and overcome, like he was told by everyone in the movie, all by himself.

a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends. an excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining. eleanor parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination. she has such an innocence to her in this movie. ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles. i especially like the hometown aura of pre-war phildelphia. the hunting scene is very good. of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten

being from the philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of philadelphia in the 1940s. there are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th street station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city. good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then. the movie gets a bit "chatty" at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest...but the overall storyline is solid and very moving. anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film "bright victory", also with local footage of the valley forge army hospital in phoenixville, pa - and scenes from downtown phoenixville. the army hospital has since become a college campus. neither of these films are out on any format and i can't imagine why. i have them both on vhs from home recording, as shown on tcm in recent years. i highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area!

definitely at the top five of best john garfield movies has to be pride of the marines. it's the true story of marine private al schmid who at the cost of his own sight, while wounded held off a horde of storming japanese on guadalcanal. the story nicely segments in three parts, al schmid's home life where he's a simple working stiff who's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. pearl harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were.the second part is at guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he's in an isolated machine gun nest, holding off japanese troops. his action prevented marine positions from being overrun, but a grenade does in his eyesight.and of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity, most of all that girl he was seeing eleanor parker.this film was broadcast on tcm on john garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary on garfield hosted by his daughter. one of the people interviewed said that garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card. in that respect he was lucky in that he did land with warner brothers in hollywood. though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio, garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background, because he came from the kind of life al schmid had, with the exception of garfield's jewish background.in that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like al schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. no super heroics here, just a guy who'd rather have been back in philadelphia, but doing a job that had to be done.it's a great part for garfield. it's a film one shouldn't miss. i do wonder though whatever happened to the real al schmid.

a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid. although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic - schmid's triumph over disability and depression. the battle scene was superb. but one bone to pick. no matter how many .50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts! it hurt the realism, but i can live with it. fine performance by eleanor parker, again, as his girl friend.

no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story, that of al schmidt, blinded on guadalcanal, as played by john garfield, who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions. robert leckie, in "helmet for my pillow",denigrates schmidt's popularity in favor of his foxhole mate, who was killed, writing that "the country must have needed live heroes." well, i suppose the country did. and they had one here. there is a single combat scene in the movie, bound to the studio lot, lasting only ten minutes or so, and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax, but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen, including those in "saving private ryan". men yell with fear, scream at each other and at the enemy, and bleed and die, without the aid of color, stereophonic sound, squibs, or gore.simply from a technological point of view, the film is outstanding. it isn't just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a .30 caliber, water-cooled browning machine gun is, or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds, or that it isn't waved around like a fire hose, as in so many other war movies. the technical precision adds to the scene's riveting quality. the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement. the performances are solid, if not bravura, including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support, john ridgeley, and a radiant, youthful eleanor parker. the framing love story is spare, but it works, and ultimately is quite moving. a striking dream sequence is included. it's not bunuel, but for a routine 1945 film, it stands out as original and effective. albert maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else. it could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity. still, there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer -- "why don't god strike me dead?" and, "in the eyes, lee. get 'em in the eyes!" depths of anguish in a few corny words. and a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film. notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn't: the dated vernacular which it's difficult to believe many of today's kids could think was actually ever spoken -- "private gab," "dope", "drip," "gee," "you dumb coot," "dame," "a swell guy," and "feeling sorry for yourself." let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments. at the time, some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge. real weak points? the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of, "just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean people will think you're a bad person." there are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative. "please, god, let him return to me," and that sort of thing. well, the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times. maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring strains of "america the beautiful" swell in the back. none of this can undo the film's virtues, which are considerable, particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene. it's not on television that often. if you have a chance, by all means catch it.

this movie is a fantastic movie. everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing. i know mr. garfield was blacklisted in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd. that being the case,why isn't this one? a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great. for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr. schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well. anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it.if it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized. colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film. the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945,film would go. mr. garfield did a superb job of portraying mr. schmid. some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr.schmid's disability but i feel he got it just right. i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two.

this is a great film classic from the 40's and well produced. there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield,(al schmid),"force of evil",'48 and dane clark,(lee diamond),"last rites",'88, fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun. when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury, his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend. dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond, who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again. there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets!

my father, dr. gordon warner (ret. major, us marine corps), was in guadalcanal and lost his leg to the japanese, and also received the navy cross. i was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and i am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then, as i read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life. my father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen as they were so i would like to believe he had something to do with that.he currently lives in okinawa, japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, she's japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the emperor of japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back kendo and iaido to japan since mcarthur banned them after wwii.my father was once a marine but i know that once you are a marine, you're always a marine. and that is exactly what he is and i love and respect him very much.i would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it. and i'd love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!

most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable. however, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films. a perfect example was the john garfield film air force--in which a b-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the japanese air force! however, pride of the marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. when i first saw this film, i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true. however, after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor. this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!

i hadn't seen this film in probably 35 years, so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television (cable) again for the first time in a very long time (it is not available on video), i made sure i didn't miss it. and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again, i found the visual images from the "pride of the marines" were as vivid and effective as i first remembered. what makes this movie so special, anyway?everything. based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crew's ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november, 1942, the screenplay stays 95% true to the book upon which it was based, "al schmid, marine" by roger butterfield, varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture. this is not a typical "war movie" where the action is central, and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film. but it is a memorable 10 minutes, filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle, and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre. in a way probably ahead of its time, the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark, ugly, brutal nature of battle, and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war. this film isn't about "glorifying" war; i can't imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service. not right away, anyway.what this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle, and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives. there's an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this, and i feel that's another reason why the film was so so well received--it was exceptionally well-written. there's a "dream" sequence done in inverse (negative film) that seems almost experimental, and the acting is strong, too, led by john garfield. garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmid's were nearly the same, and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role. actors don't do that much anymore, but added to the equation, it's just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult, unattractive story.

in the immediate aftermath following world war ii, sound minds in hollywood tried to distance themselves from the mindless flag-waving that is a natural ingredient in a war effort. "best years of our lives' and even 'gentleman's agreement' investigated the way americans looked at themselves in the wake of the war, but delmer daves' "pride of the marines" beat them to it.the film is about philadelphia smart alec john garfield who goes to war as a marine and after a nightmarish evening in a foxhole, with japanese soldiers eerily crying out at him and his buddies "mariiines, tonight you die!", he is blinded by a hand-grenade, and dumps his girlfriend back home rather than have to depend on her after coming home.delmer daves is uncompromising in his depiction on these men who are brave, as it were, almost by coincidence. they are there, in the foxhole, and when shot at, they react. so much for heroism, but they get the job done. and then comes the self-pity, the dark, gloomy sense of humor. garfield is in angry denial of his blindness and the film makes no excuses, "there's no free candy for anyone in this world", as his buddy tells him. the same guy, a jew, played by dane clark, reminds him, "in a war somebody gets it, and you're it. everybody's got problems! when i get back, some guys won't hire me, because my name is diamond".great movies are made with guts like these, and if the first half hour of 'pride of the marines' fails to rise to the occasion completely, from then on it evolves into a true work of art. you weep, and you ponder, you ache and you hope against hope. well, simply: art.

to die for has it all.this film has a great cast. lots and lots of romance and terror. not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans. there are a lot more vampire love stories. if you are a fan of vampire love stories i strongly recommend this film-10/10.

small spoilers alert !!!good movie...very good movie. and i'm surprised to say that myself, because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news. most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen. this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. this movie really fascinated me. good accomplishment, seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. it really is the story that keeps you focused. especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied. sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. of course, that's where the reality and the "based on a true story" stops. the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.in this movie, the count ( vlad teppish) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman. and they're all pretty girls, i'll give him that. overall, good acting by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr. heck, it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title. these two films have nothing else in common, but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. check it out...my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10

what a gem of a movie, so good that they made a sequel.the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other.bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad, a bit of an inkling there to who this character is, who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house.hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format.the movie is watchable, but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film, but may be that's just all part of the decadent ambiance.didn't like the ending, but there is a sequel, must track it down.when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part. later on, i couldn't stop thinking about him, he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality, so maybe he was right for the part.brendan hughes last seen in 'hitler - the rise of evil' as lt. guffman.where is he now?

when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of "the lost boys"(1987).to my surprise "to die for" is a really good movie.it's a little bit corny at times,but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.highly recommended.

i first saw this film over 25 years ago on british tv and have only just caught up with it again last week on a dvd copy bought off ebay. i had remembered the musical sequences, the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier anna neagle/michael wilding film spring in park lane and maytime doesn't stand up so well to the passage of the years. but michael wilding is a joy in the film, charming, funny, debonair, appears to be having great fun and on top of his form. worth watching for him alone. anna neagle appears a little matronly beside him, and a little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940's their film partnership was well established with the cinema going public. spring in park lane had been a top hit for 1947 and a big money maker. in his autobiography wilding wrote at length of his great regard for herbert wilcox the director and instigator of this london series of films.

although kris kristofferson is good in this role, who wouldn't want to see elvis pressly instead? with the drug addiction and the fall from supreme fame may have scared away elvis' agent to be apart of the movie, it was a mistake. this would have been a perfect movie for elvis. even though the soundtrack is far from terrific, paul williams and barbra streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. somewhat of a love story, this is more of a drama about the fall from grace and the gift of redemption. like is most tragedies, the hero of the story was die. also, gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.

i saw this movie in the theater when it came out. i grew up in scottsdale and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time. i remember at the time thinking that barbara's venture into more of a rock sound (actually r and b-to my ears) was a successful one. i was never a fan of kris's singing until his last effort for new west. as a songwriter and an actor, though, he has serious chops, imho. i think it is a fine romance. i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw selznick's janet gaynor original. i do believe that they made some changes in this long-awaited dvd release. among other things, i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic. i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god forbid, put some of his original songs in there. along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara. while doing interviews for my own new music documentary, rocking the boat: a musical conversation and journey, i interviewed stephen bruton, a fine singer/songwriter/guitarist with close professional and personal ties to kris, bonnie raitt, and delbert mcclinton, among many others. stephen was in "speedway," the john norman character's band. kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock. stephen was and is kris's friend and long time band member. there was tension on the set and at one point the band was barking at kris in barbara's presence. she remarked to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that. kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll! in the end, barbara came around and decided to use kris's band's live performances in the movie and specifically sited stephen's role in making things work. i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story. much is made of her as a diva. what she is is a pro. and i am not gay. not that there is anything wrong with that.

as a long-standing barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. that aside, this film ranks as a classic. it has it's flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. i don't think she was ever satisfied. but it gives her fans a new barbra (for the time) with live singing, a young fresh appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting.the story is rough, but exciting, and holds your interest throughout. the extended one frame "finale" is hard for most non-barbra fans to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent.

i recently watched the '54 version of this film with judy, and while i appreciated the story and music, i found that the film failed to hold my attention. i expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a barbra twist. i was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all. this version is so much more real than the '54 one, with arguably better music, better acting, a more gripping plot line, and, of course, a deeper love. i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list.

i was 16 when i first saw the movie, and it has always been a huge favorite of mine. of course, you can't deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie - how fine is that man???????????? sheesh. he still is. he's the bad boy every woman secretly wants. his acting is flawless. he played a drunk/druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could - and he had - in '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all very real.the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense, i think it's more a problem for male viewers than female. us gals are just looking at kris - and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband cannot watch the movie b/c of her - he doesn't like her looks. but i did make him sit through just the red ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting - you should have seen it on my 50" plasma - wow!!!! and lastly, the transfer quality was great - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film.brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together, i bought a copy for her for christmas. would have loved to watch it together with her last night.i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland, but i guess seeing this one first, i just can't get into the earlier era. watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what i was living at the time.i am working my way through the commentary by streisand, but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs, so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie. her voice sounds exactly the same now as then.check it out, if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) you will love it.wendy

barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story. her performances and the songs are one-of-a-kind and are special in the halls of great movies. the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson, against the crowds' wishes and hers, only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of "woman in the moon" is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience. it's real. the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business.. all live, no lip-sync, very special. streisand is often criticized for being a diva, but she delivers on this one. she is majestic singing "with one more look at you. she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen. kristopherson had his moments too, far above most of his movie appearances. this version of the "born" franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 (janet gaynor, frederic march)although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of 1954. i haven't seen the dvd yet and don't know about its quality.

considering 'a star is born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble. a viewer could be forgiven for believing that kris kristofferson & barbara streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another.the film has been described in the past as a 'barbara streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - a star is born is well worth the hiring price.with its incredible soundtrack, flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life; a star is born is a film that draws you into the world of esther hoffman & the love of her life john norman howard.a film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart...

i saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when i was barely 16 while viewing another film. oh!!!! how excited me and my best friend were. we couldn't wait for the month or so until it would come on. i saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre. i love,love,love it. kris is so perfect for the film. he is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with babs and it is so endearing to watch it again. when they sing evergreen at the studio and he chimes in with his raspy voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but i always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie. the way he looks at her and he is so proud.i could watch this movie every day. we tried to dress like est-her i even have the long sweater and cap that was so like the one she wore. this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to. maybe its just that i was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme don't know. the ending always has me in tears even today.

i swear when i first saw this movie,i cried my eyes out! a star is born is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles john norman (kris kristofferson) and esther (streisand) face. you also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! when streisand sings with one more look at you/watch closely now, it's just pure magic! this movie made the song evergreen one of my favorites,and queen bee is such a fun song. also i love the fashion of the '70s (except streisand's afro. besides that,she's a beauty.). a star is born is my number one favorite movie. this movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.

she is such an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything else!!!! that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz - bar none!! i'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such is the power of the voice. i first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me. i see it today, and yes, i can see some of the flaws (like esther wanting to leave the grammy's right as her award is being announced).but some of the other user comments are just plain false - i mean, where is the gratuitous nudity - maybe we saw different films??? streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a big ego - fine! she's earned it.

personnaly i really loved this movie, and it particularly moved me. the two main actors are giving us such great performances, that at the end, it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters.the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous, and the song are just great the way they are. that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards (the most rewarded movie at the golden globes), an oscar and even a grammy. this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone. a great movie, that has often been criticized (maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it, surely as a "co-director"). her artistry is the biggest, and that will surely please you!

i am and was very entertained by the movie. it was my all time favorite movie of 1976. being raised in the 70's , i was so in love with kris kristoffersons look and demeanor,of course i am no movie critic,but for the time era,i think it was very good. i very much like the combo of streisand and kristofferson. i thought they worked very well together. i have seen the movie many times and still love the two of them as esther and john norman. i am a very huge fan of kris and see him in concert when i can. what a talented singer song writer,not to mention,actor. i have seen him in many movies,but still think back to a star is born.

a blockbuster at the time of it's original release (it was the second-highest grossing film of 1976), the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike. the film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden globes. it's not without some irony that streisand's most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial. for every ten fans who state that star is streisand's best film, there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography. although both sides have some merit to support their claims, it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that hollywood ever produced. for my money, it's the best version of the often-told tale.the film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea, and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers. this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses it's classic predecessors. for example, the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never-ending phone calls that interrupt kristofferson's songwriting attempts. this version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters. for example, the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self-sacrificing that they came off as saints. on the other hand, esther, the female lead in this version, is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate, but also flawed and conflicted. this makes her feel more "real" than the janet gaynor or judy garland characters felt in the previous films, and makes the story that much more effective.the performances are all on target, even if some of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough. if you're looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, streisand is definitely the girl you want. she's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. simply put, her esther is a fully-realized, three-dimensional human being. kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid-back characterization, however, he's always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from newsweek, time, and even the new yorker's usually vicious pauline kael. gary busey and paul mazursky also give believable performances, but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time.the film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success, hitting the #1 on billboard's hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone. the streisand-composed "evergreen" (with lyrics from paul williams) is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop, brought to even-further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from streisand. the rest of the film's original songs (mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes) are pretty good as well, and streisand sounds fantastic - her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. streisand's vibrant performances bring "woman in the moon" and "with one more look at you" to thrilling life, and make even sillier numbers like "queen bee" work far better than they have the right to. kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline.though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well. the film is well-mounted and slickly produced, the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine, and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective. in conclusion, a star is born is not only entertaining and moving, but it also transcends all criticism.

my mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of 1976. i loved it then and i love it now. i know everyone makes fun of barbra's hair in this one, but i think she looks and sounds great! ...and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time! also, the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy! the music is great as well. this is the groovy 70's babs at her best!

thirty years after its initial release, the third version of "a star is born" finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand. that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem "woman in the moon" from this 1976 film. easy to dismiss, the movie's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including streisand's own "funny girl". this time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break.troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as john norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution). to john norman, esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade. in the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off. inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. directed by frank pierson (although streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly. the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos, she can't help but come across as an established star. i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john norman's woes become overwhelming. this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esther's response to it. this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics john norman's style toward the end.kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward esther. he makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context. otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john norman's level-headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie. veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. a big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's - some songs still quite good ("everything", "woman in the moon", "watch closely now"), some that have moved to kitsch ("queen bee", kenny loggins' "i believe in love") and of course, the inescapable "evergreen".the print transfer on the 2006 dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary. she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production. she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer, and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director. i just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen. she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e.g., it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters. i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes, especially kristofferson's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisand's optional commentary. one is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies. another is an extended scene in which she plays "evergreen" on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep. the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which i agree with streisand should have been used. fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of "a star is born" are also included.

i am a huge fan of say anything, jerry maguire, and almost famous (i wasn't that big on singles), so it's safe to say that i look forward to anything that cameron crowe attaches his name to. i went to see vanilla sky having been told that it was a very weird movie and that i probably wouldn't like it if i was expecting anything similar to crowe's other films. well, having just seen it, let me say that the former was correct, and the latter couldn't have been more wrong. it is a very weird movie, and nothing really comes together until the end. anyone who tells you that they saw it coming halfway into the movie is either lying to you or is unable to detach their hindsight from their memory. anyway, the movie was stellar, and i look forward to owning it as soon as the dvd is released. i was moved by the film, and felt emotionally spent by the end. this is an experience that will draw from the viewer the entire spectrum of human emotion, if the viewer allows him/herself into the plot. in the theatre in which i saw the movie, there were more than a few people who clearly lost track of the movie and were bored by it when they found that they were unable to get back into the plot. i'm sure others just lack the ability to properly follow any movie like this. i don't mean that to sound pompous, but some people are more cut out for the seagal, chan, van damme genre of movies, and these are the types that probably would not enjoy this movie. it is very cerebral, so make sure you are prepared for a two hour mental bender, as well as much thought afterwards.as far as comparing this film to other crowe movies, it is very similar in at least one regard, in all crowe movies, the soundtrack is a character unto itself. this is almost definitely due to crowe's longstanding ties to music, as anyone who has seen almost famous knows, and to his marriage to heart star nancy wilson. it was also worthy to note that there was a definite chemistry between tom cruise's acting and crowe's directing that made the movie seem familiar to anyone who has seen jerry maguire. in my mind, that is not a bad thing.anyway, if i had to compare this movie to any one other film, i would say this: if you enjoyed david fincher's the game, you will almost certainly be a fan of vanilla sky.

i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise's weird movies (magnolia, eyes wide shut) but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie. many people said it was weird; it wasn't. it was different and confusing but not weird. weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore. different is the truman show. confusing is the matrix or the game. and unlike kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. vanilla sky is confusing because david aames (tom cruise) is confused. that's the point. that's where the so-called "weirdness" that turned critics away came in. if they had bothered to "open [their] eyes" as the original 1997 spanish movie, they would have seen that. and if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the "feel" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. with songs like the beach boys' "good vibrations" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly "right" feel. a wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, vanilla sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. excellent: a+

comparable to fight club, the matrix, a.i., sixth sense, among others. this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before. the first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz-cruise-cruz. the rest of the movie is, well, confusing, you'll pick more every time you watch it (i've gone to the movies to see it 3 times now)

note: these comments are for people who have seen the movie.vanilla sky is a brilliant, complex, and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says: lovehatedreamslifeworkplayfriends. maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle.considering the following:now, i have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene, so i will have to further examine my assertions, (and i welcome your thoughts) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place: where exactly does the debatable 'splice' occur?now, i'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the l.e. 'technician', since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of david aames's mind/dream/coma state, but the true splice between reality and dream.it seems to me that the reality of the car crash, the way that it is filmed (no explosion, for example) is a likely 'splice' point, and that any particular sequence containing an existential/dream/coma/non-reality feel to it -- whether it's shown onscreen before or after the crash -- is actually a part of aames' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind.in that respect, then, we are left with two questions at the very end(if you know of more, let me know): is aames actually disfigured, and where does he wake up?if you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today's pop-culture society.

it does seem like this film is polarizing us. you either love it or hate it. i loved it.i agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta "feel" this one.also, early in the film, tom cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by monet--an impressionist painter. monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is. cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". i believe this is a hint to the moviegoer. this movie is like that impressionist painting. it's impressionist filmmaking! and it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.this is not your typical linear plot. it requires more thought. there is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. but at the end, all is explained.you will need to concentrate on this movie but i think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it. after it ends is when you should think about it. if you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself. just let it happen..."go" with it...keep an open mind. remember what you see and save the analysis for later.i found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding.but i will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it. it appeals to a certain taste. if you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then see it. if you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.but if you do like what i described, then you will surely enjoy it.

made me think about it for days after seeing it. that to me is the mark of a great movie. eyes wide shut had the same effect on me. i am tired of these people requiring these happy hollywood cookie-cutter endings. i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better - but regardless, the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt.

warning: does contain spoilers.open your eyesif you have not seen this film and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. you have to see this film. i have seen it four times so far and i still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well. his name was mr. krisak. to me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on. if we didn't like shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix. now if i didn't know better, i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr. krisak. but giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him. but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. show me how you can tell that you are real. this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i'm sure you can imagine. everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. after every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless."what if you are nothing but someone else's dream?"what if you were someone else's dream? what a messed up question that is. this was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers. how possible could it seem back then? but if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.another brilliant but surreal film this year, david lynch's mulholland drive explored similar areas. but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. in short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.open your eyes.tom cruise plays david aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the seven dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. early in the film we meet one of david's gorgeous toys named julie gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz. david and julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. this is the type of relationship commensurate with david's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life. and although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. next we meet brian shelby, played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith's good buddy jason lee. brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends. this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again. and that is " the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter." he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.at david's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday) brian enters with his date, sofia sorrano, played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another. and in typical david fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with sofia. to complicate things, julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david. david then spends the night with sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. there is no hanky panky. the next day, as david is leaving sofia's apartment, he is greeted by julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, i think we have all seen the commercials.that is all i will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. there is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret. sixth sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze. regardless of how it originated, vanilla sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters. and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up, something more i can understand. to be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. all of the ersatz so called "best pictures of the year" have been good but nothing spectacular. they lack substance. a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat, the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it. this is what film making is supposed to be like. this is what a film is supposed to do to you. it is supposed to make you feel something. most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. this one isn't.10 out of 10 the best film of the year. i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress, diaz for best supporting, cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. cameron crowe should there as well. none of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. this is one film that should not be missed. and on a final note, i am quite sure mr. krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. can you prove you are real? or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement? this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. and i'm sure that is just fine with him.open your eyes

this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see. i was talked into it and dragged into the theater, but boy am i glad for that. i thought it was going to be just another love story, but it turns out to be sooo much more than that. definatly an intellectual flick, one of those movies you have to pay attention to.

david aames is a rich good-looking guy who lives in new york city. when his 'sleeping partner' julie gianni gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty sofia, she gets david into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with, but seeing as he's in love with sofia, she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her, by driving off a bridge. david survives the crash, but is left with a disfigured face. he is then charged with the murder of julie. the thing is, david doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams (most of which are actually nightmares.) and flashbacks, some of which just don't make sense to him. everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth.well, there's an all star cast here, including tom cruise, penélope cruz, cameron diaz, kurt russell, jason lee and noah taylor who all give good performances in the movie. in the movie they all put off different things about there characters, like happiness, sadness, angry, etc. really well. there's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant, steven spielberg.vanilla sky is a well made, different, interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished. it's not just a thriller, but it's a real psychological thriller. the trailer for the movie is really good, but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be. it's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too. all in all, an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too. they are sure making a lot of "are they dead, if not who is dead" movies recently.

as the one-line summary says, two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater. the one was "stir of echoes" with kevin bacon, and the second was "vanilla sky".its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you, stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants... walking out of the cinema was a bit weird, like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything. one of those movies that you become one with the guy, and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie.one thing is certain. the actors are awesome, the sound track is excellent, and everything in the movie is 9+.surely one of the best movies i ever saw, and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world.

this film was just absolutly brilliant. it actually made me think. during the whole movie i was confused as hell. i loved everything about it...it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird, it was hard not to love it. all of the actors were phenominal, and no one could have done a better job...this is one of my favorites of the year...it deserves an ocar.

i went to see vanilla sky with a huge, huge, huge!!..tom cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can i say .. i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tc's performance, i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting.i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it, i am so pleased that i was 'coerced 'into seeing it. the strange thing is i cannot say why, all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day. as to what i felt about the film, all i can say about is, its not the storyline (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events, like getting into a car can change everything......as to what the critics wrote, yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for alejandro amenábar , but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruz.i cannot even consider writing a couple of trite, glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it!!!!yes i know this isn't a balanced thoughtful review but so what .it's not that kind of film.

despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky, i was expecting to be disappointed by the film because i'd heard that it did not get great reviews. however, i left the cinema completely in awe of how good vanilla sky is.there was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is believable. the romantic moments between cruise's character, david aames and cruz's character, sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).the plot of vanilla sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending. however, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for david aames.the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout. this isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch. but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it. i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.

i really liked this movie. i've read a few of the other comments, and although i pity those who did not understand it, i do agree with some of the criticisms. which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie all the more. i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public, yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch. i also love the movies, such as this one, which provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. congratulations mr.crowe, definitely in my top ten.p.s. saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico, it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip! where does the dream end and the real begin?

strangely, this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced. aided by hindsight, crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabar's original. the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes, but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky. that's what i mean by more "fleshed out."

this is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot. suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial "tom cruise screws around with multiple women" plot.the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm, and all the cast are well suited to their parts: cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all - and then loses it all, diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover, cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist. the story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip.i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on.if you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution, then this is a must-see. 9/10

after reading some quite negative views for this movie, i was not sure whether i should fork out some money to rent it. however, it was a pleasant surprise. i haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, i'd be in heaven.tom cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable david, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were magnolia and born on the fourth of july). penelope cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does diaz. the only disappointment is the slightly bland kurt russell. in the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.cameron crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. the increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by crowe (the brief sequence where cruise walks through an empty time square is incredibly effective). the soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a crowe movie) is also sublime.you will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. the plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable. the movie isn't perfect, but its a welcome change of pace for cruise and crowe and for those raised on a diet of hollywood gloss, should be a revelation.

i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise. i didn't cared much about tom cruise's acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie...not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character....they merge and then speak and its beautiful. however i must say this movie doesn't come under the "average flick of weekend" which you pick at random and watch gleefully; it carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns. it certainly needs more than that.

this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain. this movie was not the best the first time i watched it, but after about 3 more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen. it takes place in new york, and progresses on through his lifestyle. he discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (diaz). he goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. this film was beyond my expectations, and is one of cruise's best films ever!

i'm from romania i'll try to speak in english. all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. it has all the little things i like in a movie , it's very touching makes me cry . shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. it so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie. perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture , it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. it's a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) hail from romania

"the sweet is never as sweet without the sour." this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. you cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). the theme will really get you to "open your eyes".only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. i think the end is perfect though. i recommend you watch it and see for yourself.

this film is one of tom cruise's finest films. he captures the audiences imaginations with his role of david aames. his character can relate to us all in some way.the story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film. i never really watched cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. my favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. it's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it. my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did and it became one of my favourite films of all time. it's a* 10/10 i promise once you watch it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.

i could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best films ever made." if you think vanilla sky is simply a "re-make," you could not be more wrong. there is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (times square, post-climactic scenes).the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. without the music, the story is only half told. nancy wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. if you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). crowe's other musical selections, such as the beach boys, josh rouse, spiritualized, sigur ros, the monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (crowe has an ear for great music).more importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; i admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.the best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.this is easily cameron crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. it has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (i guess to understand true art is an art itself).bottom line: vanilla sky is in a league of its own.

"vanilla sky" was a wonderfully thought out movie. or rather, "abre los ojos" was well thought out. i watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. i wasn't disappointed. by the end of the movie, i was awstruck. i couldn't get it off my mind. the whole idea of it just blew me away. the ending, was more of a surprise than shyamalan could ever do. the plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. the cast, superb. it was an all around wonderful movie. the kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. i've seen it four or five times and i'm always finding something new. it's a movie to keep you interested forever.

vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos (open your eyes). and in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. tom cruise plays david aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. jason lee plays brian shelby, david's best, and in many ways, only friend. penelope cruz plays sofia serrano, brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to david's birthday party. cameron diaz plays julie gianni, david's occasional bed buddy. kurt russell plays dr. curtis mccabe, a psychologist interviewing david. all of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make vanilla sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. i won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. if you pay attention, you won't be confused. the film is very complex, but not confusing. and in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.

how strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory. and how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity? what is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream? or can we? perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality. it's a concept visited by filmmaker cameron crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `vanilla sky,' starring tom cruise and penelope cruz. at the age of thirty-three, david aames (cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. his fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young mr. aames of the lion's share of the company. and fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that david lacks the focus the job requires.admittedly, david likes to play; still, he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit, whether the board (he refers to them as the `seven dwarfs') likes it or not, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly. but during a lavish birthday party in his honor, one of the corporate lawyers, thomas tipp (timothy spall) warns david that the seven are up to something behind his back. at the time, however, it's the last thing on david's mind; he's been having a casual affair with a friend, julie gianni (cameron diaz), but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind. her name is sofia (penelope cruz), and after knowing her for only one night, she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down, as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever. and he is about to learn that sometimes, there is simply no going back.director cameron crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one; far more than a movie, `vanilla sky' is a vision realized. beginning with the first images that appear on screen, he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting. it's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away; emotionally, it's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted, because it requires some effort to stay with it. but it's worth it. think `memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush. there's darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain. and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky. simply put, this one's a real trip; it's exciting-- and it's a mind bender.as to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of tom cruise as maverick in `top gun,' or his ethan hunt in `mission impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here. because as david aames, cruise gives the best performance of his career, one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door. he's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like `magnolia' and `eyes wide shut' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here. and give him credit, too, for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity; this is cruise as you've never seen him before. `jerry maguire' earned him an oscar nomination, and this one should, also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers. cruise is not just good in this movie, he is remarkable.penelope cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as sofia, the woman of david's dreams. there's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special `something extra' to the part. but crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors, and he certainly did with cruz.he also knew what he was doing with cameron diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of julie. she's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen. but make no mistake, this is no `window-dressing' part, and diaz delivers a complete package with this character. the quality of her performance can be measured, in fact, in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time. and it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes julie so unforgettable. overall, a terrific job by diaz.the supporting cast includes kurt russell (dr. mccabe), jason lee (brian), johnny galecki (peter), armand schultz (dr. pomerantz), noah taylor (ed), mel thompson (`l.e.' man), jean carol (woman in new york) and john fedevich (silent ed). about half-way through, this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality; but rest assured, by the end of `vanilla sky' all will be revealed. it's a reality-bender, to be sure, and a wild one; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience, one you have to see to believe. it's the essential, and absolute, magic of the movies. 10/10.

i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that's why i had avoided it. today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. vanilla sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best i've seen in a while. i was surprised by how i was affected watching it. it's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.i really recommend everyone to watch this movie. regardless of what you have heard about it.

i for one really like this movie for some reasons i'll go into late but i want to touch on why i think people don't like it. first off, there are people out there who just like to hate tom cruise. i don't understand it really. second, cameron crowe i think successfully p***es off two groups of movie-goers with this film. the casual, relaxed, "not looking to think too hard" group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie. and the deep, philosophical, mystery-fans are devastated when crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery.this is a good movie. and tom cruise does a very good job in it. i think it's probably his best performance from what i've seen all though i haven't seen all of his movies, or even a majority of them probably. the supporting cast is good as well. penelope cruz gives a solid performance and jason lee was enjoyable.i like the story, and i think that's what vanilla sky is more than anything. it's a mystery, an adventure, and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. and it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it, and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy. david aames (cruise) is the man that had everything he wanted, more or less lost it, was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back, and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening, chooses reality, simplicity, and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on: happiness.many people were disappointed that crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end. i think it's necessary. the audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that david is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful.and the music in the movie is great. it's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is. particularly, "njosnavelin" by sigur ros, which is an amazing song.all in all, i'd give it 3 out 4 stars. it's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through, and a great story for those looking to relax. that "moderate" approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery, or a full blown love story. it mixes and matches different elements and genres.

getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990. shot partly in the biltmore estate in asheville, nc and the remaining parts in winston-salem. the massive offices of the rj reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the tulip capital of the world winston-salem! i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where renee russo and jim belushi went on their date. i also had a big hand in decorating the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr. destiny. i tacked all those pics on the wall of sports heroes and decorated that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab. i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it. i remember dyeing the grass at his old house with green dye because it first had to be sodded(it was a new house in a new development and i guess they leased it for the movie)..then i had to cut that newly laid sod to make it look nice..man that was hard! as far as the movie, when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of "what if" as good as i ever had seen it, including the great it's a wonderful life. i cried so many timesi can't count. i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league ballpark where larry's boyhood scenes were played and replayed. i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer, i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite amiable and said "why not!" he is a good guy and a really natural and forceful actor. i can't say the same for jim belushi..he was so full of himself, smoking big cuban cigars and talking loudly soeveryone in earshot could hear his every word. his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently. i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance. it's wonderful and really heartfelt and real. you can feel larry's pain after he enters into the new world mr. destiny gives him after hitting the homer, and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is. they all think he belongs in a nuthouse! but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly, especially his wonderful wife, played so beautifully by linda hamilton..and he wants his dog back! so see it.

reading the various external reviews of roger ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie, even though i only have a dubbed-into-japanese video version of it.apparently, many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before, most famously in the very great "it's a wonderful life." to me, a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it's used, and i'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise--the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of "divine magic."i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story, but i don't go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand--i go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will. if you are sentimental sort like myself, you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture. the performances are excellent throughout, and the movie was very well cast. wonderful choice of music, too. michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender. jim belushi does a great job as an "average joe" kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn't gone as it should. linda hamilton, always excellent, is again right on target here as the loving wife. jon lovitz entertains as usual, and even has some surprisingly moving moments in "mr. destiny."no, "mr. destiny" is not "it's a wonderful life," but who says it has to be? taken on its own terms, "mr. destiny" is an enjoyable, well-made, funny, and moving film. i've seen my japanese-dubbed video of it numerous times, and i'm sure i'll see it several more times. if that somehow makes me a "lowbrow," so be it! i'm just glad that i hadn't read any reviews of "mr. destiny" before seeing it.i suppose i should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars, but i couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews!

ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum, and it is a modern update on "it's a wonderful life". but it's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13. you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs. however it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it.

i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya, i've enjoyed it every single time. this is belushi's pinnacle movie in my opinion. belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching. the movie has a wonderful cast of stars, some already were big, and others were just getting started. it's billed as a feel good movie, and that's exactly what it is. this movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all. sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. when you're done watching, you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling. you can't ask for much more from a movie in my opinion, not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. very very underrated movie here folks.rating from me: 10 i am out!!!

it has been some years since i saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. it kind of became a "therapy" for me with a personal experience of my own.a thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he "missed the ball" and his team lost. he thinks about it 20 years later, "if only i'd hit that ball" and how his life would be better because of it. then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.it reminds me so much of when i was in high school, i twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. if you were on it, you were "all that." i didn't try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time, i took it really hard. i'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. that was in 1987.through the years, even now sometimes, i think "if only i hadn't hit my leg i would've never worn those stupid tights." now i don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn't have met my son's father.i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. be careful what you wish for!!!

i actually like this movie even though i don't fancy james belushi very much. in this movie, you can actually see several big names on the rise, linda hamilton and courteney cox namely; caine's was already big of course. the plot in this movie is simple; its just like that sliding door movie. it however was told in a light-hearted manner and i like the comedy moments in it. it made me trying to relive my own important moments in live, eg what if i've taken that girl out for a movie, and not the other etc. it tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change. it also reminds us to be careful what we wish for. life is not always as good on the other side as we think; maybe, what we have now is the best for us, all things considered.

larry burrows has the distinct feeling he's missing out on something. ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship, he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot. then one night his car breaks down again. walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck, larry happens upon barman mike, who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever.......the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing, stretching back to the likes of it's a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click. it's a genre that has produced very mixed results. back in 1990 was this james belushi led production, rarely mentioned when the said topic arises, it appears that it has largely been forgotten. which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department. we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end, but it's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down. the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was. i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation isn't your thing,? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway. but for those engaged by the likes of red heat, k-9 and taking care of business, well mr. destiny is right up your street. along for the ride are linda hamilton, michael caine, jon lovitz, hart bochner, jay o. sanders, rene russo and courteney cox.mr. destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart. 7/10

it's not a big film. the acting is not amazing (some sub charterers are even played badly), the film is not beautiful in any sense. nothing really inventive or new. if you like big films, this one is not for you. yet it has a big - really big plus on the story. larry's story works, because we know this story from our own lives. the girl we didn't ask to a date, the test we've failed, the friend we let down, are all in our history. this movie works, because it touch it, it's a great story because it's a small one. it's the life we all have, with regrets we all have, and yet the message hits: every life we could have lived would have had their downside. the first time i watched it, i was 15. it was shown in a party at my school. 16 years later, i keep reflecting on it every once in a while, and every time i see it, it puts a smile on my face. watch it. it will do you good. you'll be happier with what you have.

mr. destiny - 3.5/5 stars"mr. destiny's" theme is recycled from many films spanning many different years. its theme ranges from recent spoofs on such plots (see "scrooged"), to the same, more serious and dramatic notion that worked in "it's a wonderful life," and a century earlier in the story of scrooge as told by charles dickens in "a christmas carol." "it involves an ungrateful man being taken on a guided tour of his life, and witnessing how his life could have been (or would have been) first-hand. in most of these types of movies the guardian angel rescues a man from ungratefulness and shows him his life in retrospect, or how it could have been. should have been. would have been. in this case we are shown a businessman named larry (james belushi). he hates his life. he lives with an unexciting wife (linda hamilton) and yearns for a bigger life with bigger meaning. if only he had hit the ball at the state championship in high school years ago. he is convinced his life would have been better. i guess he remembers this seemingly small moment of his life because it made a big impact on his subconscious side, but i doubt a grown man would yearn for one single act from high school. still, it works in the movie.anyway, larry is driving home from work one night, where he is a penpusher along with jon lovitz, when his car breaks down. he wanders into a bar looking for a pay phone, and reluctantly decides to tell the bartender (michael caine) about the way his life is turning out. this is where we first see him remembering his childhood baseball strike-out.the bartender listens and nods, apparently not worrying about any other customers. this is probably due to the fact that the bar, though old and tattered, seems to have never been occupied by any living humans save these two men. in fact, larry even makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. this is most likely for a certain reason that the audience is expecting before larry. so the bartender, who may as well be an angel of god incarnate, just like clarence, fixes larry a special drink of his, which ends up putting larry's life on reverse, showing him what his life would have been like if he had hit the home run all those years before. but larry has no idea of any change at first, just like jimmy stewart didn't realize that clarence had erased his life until he went into the bar and got kicked out larry continues to be oblivious to any change until he goes to his home to find the lawn different outside, and a large, wrestler-type man occupying his home.larry soon finds out his life would indeed have been very different had he hit the home run. instead of marrying linda hamilton he married rene russo and moved into a large mansion with children. he finds out that jon lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of his. and the most surprising fact of all is that with his new life, that larry has always wanted...he finds himself lusting after his old wife, linda hamilton; proof that sometimes money and a great-looking yet shallow wife don't make up everything in a man's life, like an intelligent wife and love and true happiness. just like "it's a wonderful life" showed the audience a man's life is what he makes it, and that every person has an impact on people, "mr. destiny" shows us that material wealth is not the same as spiritual wealth, a lesson taught us over and over again, but never quite so fluffy, forgettable and truly sweet as it is shown us in "mr. destiny.""mr. destiny" is never exceedingly hilarious, but it is a sweet, good-natured comedy that never takes itself too seriously. the problem with all the "it's a wonderful life" retreads out there, like "the family man," is that they try to be as influential and memorable as "it's a wonderful life" was. but there are only so many times you can single-handedly rip off a famous film, and "mr. destiny" knows this, and plays right to the fact. it doesn't try to be anything it isn't; rather, it is something it didn't try to be, and this is obvious to the audience. 

everyone plays their part pretty well in this "little nice movie". belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently, but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better. the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not or cannot have. if u can get this movie on video for around $10, it´d be an investment!

not really a big box office draw, but i was pleasently surprisedwith this movie. james "i did some things to farrah fawcett" orr co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary, average guynamed larry burrows who thinks his life would have beenincredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball gamewhen he was 15. but thanks to mysterious and magical bartendermike, larry gets his wish, yet soon realizes that his new lifeisn't exactly as he hoped it would be.i must say, this movie really impressed me. critics have givenit mixed, and i must say the concept is really interesting andpulled off well. yes, it is a little standard, but packs enoughfunny moments, drama and excellent acting to make it reallygood. james belushi (i think) was oscar worthy for his role. jonlovitz is perfect, and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine intheir roles. michael caine is perfect as the bartender. it'sjust a good movie with a good lesson. if you've never seen, ihighly recommend you check

spoiler!!! this movie is based on the concept of what if? of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question. the main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction. the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game. this event sets into motion one's destiny; just like ashton in "the butterfly effect" except mr. destiny uses comedy over drama. the results make a fresh, somewhat original movie. if one's philosophical are in tune with "the butterfly effect" one will likely enjoy mr. destiny. i give it a 7 out of 10. amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally watched the ending on tbs.

jim belushi is terrific as the "average joe" who gets his 15 minutes in "the twilight zone". michael cane is the mysterious bar tender who not only listens to belushi's "story", but has a "cure" for all of belushi's middle class problems: a magic potion to bring about an avalanche of changes in belushi's life.flashbacks show a 15 year old horribly ashamed of causing his high school baseball team's championship defeat. belushi goes on with his "pitiful life", seemingly happy, but always wondering "what if..." for what seems to be several days, belushi experiences a "different" life, one of enormous success, admired and hated by others in equal measure.this is not quite "it's a wonderful life", but some elements are similar, and very endearing. the "ending" is predictable, but still satisfying. watch for a very young cortney cox in a bit part as "fatal attraction" -like other woman. a very pleasant film!

belushi at his most ingratiating and courtney cox before friends has a small role. i often think belushi is under-used in hollywood and this film role is one of his best. for those of you who watch his tv show, this is a very different and likable character. the movie itself is not earth shattering, nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing. the supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although lovitz's whining can get tiresome, and michael caine's charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well-meaning edge. hamilton, as belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. in addition, renee russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the "prom queen" who got away. nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.

this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different. it plays right into the " multiple universe " theory.the only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry burrows ( james belushi)has such a hard time understanding what is going on, that everything has changed.

ok, so it borrows a little from "it's a wonderful life", but that was 44 years prior to this film, so why not a new attempt. belushi is having a rotten 35th birthday. he didn't get his wheaties, his coffee, and has lost his job. the capper is when his self described "big blue piece of sh**" car breaks down at the end of the day. he heads into an empty bar to call for a tow. while waiting, he's recognized by the bartender (caine) as the kid who lost the town's championship baseball game 20 years earlier. this gets him to thinking how life would've been if he had won the game. he finds out when, unbeknownst to him, caine serves up a motion potion in a glass that gives him a mansion, the prom queen (russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company he's been canned from. caine later reveals himself as the one who's responsible for this change, but belushi is not entirely on board. he never fully adjusts, and in a plot development that doesn't kill the movie but is still odd, he tries to court his wife (hamilton) from his real life, who is now married to someone else. the good move is that they don't spend too much time on it, as basically they rip of "ghost", with belushi constantly telling hamilton things only she could know. it also brings in a hokey dramatic element, as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, new wife russo, and his unbalanced lover cox. but the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning, and cheery end. also good work from the big and recognizable cast, as belushi is very likable, very attractive ladies chosen, and caine is perfectly easy going as the title guy. strange that this was belushi's second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches, which was found in "taking care of business". though similar, both films are on the same level of laughs provided. so check this out for a fun exploration of "what if?"

i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories, from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 12:01. among those greats is this little gem. it's pretty difficult to get through mr. destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member, from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox. this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film, but it's a fine cheer-up on a rainy afternoon. it's also a great rental for an inexpensive date.

entertaining jim belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of it's a wonderful life. michael caine plays a sort-of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had "made it big". jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton. not an oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun.

this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay (ulee's gold). nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the independent spirit award, looking at ruby's day to day life. what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby. ashley judd (sisters) won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role. ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. she explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival. as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance. i appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the hollywood baggage.although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody's fool, staring paul newman. the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. i like that. the story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. the only thing i am not sure about is the title. i am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in florida. as i am allergic to mosquitos, florida is no paradise to me, i itch all over thinking about florida. i turn into a complete red boil. i recommend this movie! favorite scenes: ruby and her friend rochelle bridges, played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city, florida. indeed the sand is very white. i have been there. favorite quotes: "necessity has always been a good excuse." "all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now, who is going to be and when and why."

this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own. the realism and subtle nuances, offered to ashley judd's character, ruby, by the storyline, capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida. from the slam of a screen door, to the lack of work, the echoes of what life is really like on the "red-neck riviera" provide rough choices for the young girl. paradise did not come easy. but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit, and learns to be her own woman, with a strength that flows from within. ashley judd's winning smile, and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration. the careful pace of the character development resembles that of "ulee's gold" in 1997, starring peter fonda, and also directed by victor nunez.

i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great. rubyin paradise is one of her best. it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it. a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy. some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals. they were very good moviesalso, but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of ashley's best.

allison dean's performance is what stands out in my mind watching this film. she balances out the melancholy tone of the film with an iridescent energy. i would like to see more of her.

this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class, and ashley judd fills the role impeccably. it may appear slow for thrill seekers though. cool movie for a calm night.

another one of those films you hear about from friends (...or read about on imdb). not many false notes in this one. i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up car.the heroine, ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. i found myself wondering why, why didn't she lean a bit more on mike's shoulder, but...she has her reasons, as it turns out.just a fine film. the only thing i don't much like about it, i think, is the title.

in the sea of crap that hollywood (and others) continue to put out, this is one of those diamonds in the rough. a small, simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life.ashley judd is really quite amazing in this movie. i had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she's extremely talented.watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so i was skeptical i would even care. i thought, "oh boy, some dumb chic flick or feminist male-bashing indie crap..." i was pleasantly surprised. without analyzing the many relevant themes, i'll just say, if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. sometimes the down-to-earth, slice-of-life movies are the best, and this is a great one.

my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore. i think the title especially put me off. i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over. i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store. it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did. i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life. the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. i could have kept watching for hours. another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since. she is so perfect in this movie. this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.

victor nunez imbues this unsentimental tale of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry seldom seen in cinema. by poetry i mean the sense in which the literary and the cinematic come into play. there is something very literary about the film, almost as if a novel has been adapted page by page to screen. in this sense, the film achieves depths many cannot; but it is also rather slow at other times, undercutting the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui. the film's star ashley judd has not yet made a better film than her debut here. she fits the role of lead ruby like a glove, almost as if she didn't have to act. she has true movie star presence in the film, and hasn't really managed to convey the same allure in her later films, although she was impressive in normal life.

this will be a different kind of review. i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in. sundance's reaction made an impression on me too, as did the director, victor nunez, who has directed and written several movies about florida. this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it. the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. well, i told you it would be a different kind of review.

this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez' that i ever say, and boy am i glad i did. its' quiet tone, its' relaxed pace, its' realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life, its' fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life, the decisions she makes based on real things, the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the " star wars " movies, and, given what those films are like, that means this film deserves a high rating indeed. ashley judds' acting, mr. nunez'writing, and its' great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming-of-age story and a wonderful movie.

"ruby in paradise" is a beautiful, coming-of-age story about a young woman, ruby lee gissing, escaping her stifling roots to become herself. although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd -- in likely her first movie role, albeit one to be quite proud of -- the emphasis is not upon becoming "somebody," a la the next madonna (whether jesus' mother or the lurid, attention-hungry singer).it instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them, to grow into one's ideal, adult self. note: this isn't an action movie!!! it uses an occasional voice-over narration (by ms. judd) while writing in her journal -- and oh, i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there. but be patient with this beautiful movie, where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in -- oh, i dunno, carrying water and chopping wood.actor/director/writer todd field, who played nick nightingale in "eyes wide shut," co-stars as ruby lee's noble love interest, one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth.but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee: there's no external hero imposed upon her. the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. writer/director victor nunez, who also wrote/directed "ulee's gold," did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself -- confronting age-old challenges of good v. evil along the way.the supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips (whom i hear is the wife of t. bone burnett), is right on -- most especially "trying to hold on to the earth." now, when i hear the first few chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet, charming message of empowerment.this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his/her way. for any woman of any age, it is a must see! the downside: it is not on dvd, except in spanish. (we learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version, which can be readily found online. my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me.) although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air  on an indie channel, usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world. so buy a copy for yourself.this movie should have a major re-release, and it would, if i were queen of hollywood.-- figgy jones

i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is. suffice it to say, anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem, this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind. the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness. the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard, and is happy as a result. persifina, the laundry co-worker of ruby's (ashley judd) is another=-her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day. i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends, and i realize that being alone--ruby is alone quite often--isn't the same as being lonely. recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie.

very slow-paced, but intricately structured and ultimately very touching. a nice, very true-to-life look at a small florida beach town in the dead of winter -- i've been there, and this is absolutely accurate.it's also the debut feature of actress ashley judd, and she makes a big impression here. it's hard to believe this film is 12 years old -- i remember seeing it in theaters, and i recently rented "ruby" again. except for the 80's looking clothes, it has held up very nicely. ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing. boy, talk about failing to fulfill your early promise! anyone seeing ashley here in "ruby in paradise" would assume this elegant, natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting -- instead she has become the "go to" girl for dumb action films and slasher movies! very disappointing, but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise.as some other commenter's say, this is not for everyone as it's very slow paced. this is not an action film, nor is it really a romance. the director (victor nunez, "ulees gold", another excellent character study) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail. in that way, i think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that i can recall -- it's not about ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity", but about her life choices and her growing maturity.a lovely film, if you take the time to watch it...i think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls (or boys for that matter) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it.particular kudos to director nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and nicely detailed that i assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir, but in fact it's mr. nunez's original work. rated 8 out of 10.

i think the weighted average for this film is too low. i give it a 7. very entertaining, although over the top in a few places. my wife says it passes the danielle steele test. superb performances throughout, particularly by andie macdowell.

"crush" examines female friendship, for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme (e. g., "steel magnolias"). at the same time, it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise. the events depicted were highly improbable, but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me. not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd, but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears.

this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town. one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever. definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! a powerful piece of work. this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.*spoiler!!! spoiler alert!! spoiler!!*the main character is taken by her young, handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms. her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy. she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop. in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together.(in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted)

the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty". beauty is all around, in actors' play (andie is superb as always), in well designed shots, and in authors' red line idea - the love.i think the kenny's character is the only white spot in these three womens' otherwise boring and predictable life. his interaction makes andie's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be. when he's gone, it became obvious that we cannot really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires.the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad, instead it shows that life prevails in any forms, even in this small british village, which is shown perfectly.another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways - all that houses and "fags" and accents :))). and andie again is doing superb job! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks. 10 out of ten!

well, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. it was funny and sad and yes, the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot. interesting, realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery. i think my mum would like it. i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f**kers club though...

me being of irish origins, loved this movie, not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest. i loved the girl who he fell in love with too, she was pretty. they were such a cute couple. the ending was so sad. love this movie! although it is a little dirty, it reminds of a british or irish version of prime. if you liked this movie you should watch prime. same story line young guy falls for older women, older women falls for young guy to. a lot of paths cross, in the end, the best decision is made or task is completed. don't have anything else to say, without ruining the whole movie, all though i thought the french guy was ugly, less appealing to me. umm...if you like irish movies, i would recommend "circle of friends" ,that movie is so good. quick quote, you might not get unless you watch it" well, thats my dinner ruined." lol

tess of the storm country was a mary pickford vehicle i had intended to get for some time. i finally found a vhs copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it.mary gives her typical spunky, innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong-side-of-tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. only this time the stakes are higher: a false murder charge, an illegitimate child (and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood) and contemplated suicide.one can see why pickford wanted to redo this one. the story is a real morality tale, the kind that she loved to star in. the controversial topics aren't always spelled out plainly; a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing  although everything is more or less explained in the end.about the only negative remark i can make would be concerning jean hersholt and the dog. hersholt, whose character, ben letts, looks to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to mary, of course!), is sent fleeing in panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab charges toward him! then, to top it off (or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog), it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later, as a bad storm hits! this is the same lovable lab that sleeps with frederick (lloyd hughes) and cuddles with mary! yet mary later throws boiling water in ben's face, which barely slows him! ok, i've vented about ben and the chocolate lab! other than that, the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention. pickford's supporting cast was strong and believable. this is certainly among her better films.

mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role. well said! she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title card. needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. indeed, in my opinion, the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema.true, director john s. robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish, but in robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective. a creative artist of the first rank, robertson is a master of pace, camera angles and montage. he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players. jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive, it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian; while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career. true, it's probably not the way mrs white intended, but it serves the plot admirably, as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother-in-law! needless to say, this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug, middle-class christianity. notice how the well-washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption, but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer. this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented."tess" also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress, gloria hope, whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema. she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children. lloyd hughes died in 1958, but she lived until 1976, easily contactable in pasadena, but i bet no-one had the brains to interview her. another opportunity lost! to me, forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner. i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this: he usually played priests or judges! but david torrence as usual was superb.in all, an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values.

this film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques.the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience.one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has. silent film making was pure art, it had to hold the attention through its structure, direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions. a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable.this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes. this is not a 'christiany' film, it is not selling anything. these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on sundays was a national past time, christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then. the themes would have rung true and deep at the time.it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie (and it is not preaching religion to anyone, only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest)that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality, along with some other individuals he named. ny times 1922.maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and, learned some lessons.the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000. the film representative in the debate however made the following observations; that saloon attendance had also dropped, that there were far more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole.thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film.this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices. mary pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character. this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film.this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly, languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character. it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section. the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound, running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing. it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken, but it feels like you have heard everything.the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope, jean hersholt and lloyd hughes. the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow, a near perfect balance and ending. this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated. chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford.another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored, with the actors over-exposure. that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability.

tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films. at two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a "greatest hits" performance with bits of mary the innocent, mary the little devil, mary the little mother, mary the spitfire, mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question! if the academy awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's.

had this been the original 1914 version of tess of the storm country (also starring mary pickford), i probably would have rated it a lot higher, as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens. however, by 1922, this film was already starting to show its age. and, compared to many of ms. pickford's other films (such as daddy longlegs, sparrows, my best girl and suds), tess comes up a tad short--and not every pickford film merits a 10 (even if she was "america's sweetheart"). now this isn't to say that it's a bad film--it certainly isn't. but, i just can't see how so many have given this film a 10.the film has a very long and complicated plot--especially because most films of the era were shorter. a rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river. at the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict. so he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land. one ends up in tragedy, when his daughter's fiancé is killed in a scuffle with the po' folks. the man accused of the murder is dear old mary's father, though he is innocent. to make things a lot worse, the only witness to the real murder won't talk and the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant! so, at this point, we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is "in the family way". there's a ton more to the film, such as the crank's son falling in love with mary, but it's best you just see the film for yourself.the film excels in some ways. the plot, while very complicated, is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top-notch. the very final scene is also pretty cute. however, there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife. mary is so good and so sweet and so plucky, at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take. while it worked great in 1922 (making her the biggest star in the world), today it's very dated. this is not true of all her films, but this one certainly is.by the way, the image entertainment dvd is of decent quality, though a few scenes are badly degraded--something that isn't very surprising considering the age of the film. also, the only extras included are a brief filmography.

andie macdowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie. when you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or all your life) you may feel you are wasting away. the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active. i liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (macdowell). her ex-student is cute enough, still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long. there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical, though. for example, at a scene where the other women's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man, would a mature police officer (the other friend of macdowell) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car? of course accidents happen all the time, but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with (that was the hardest part to believe!! for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long??)... maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long. beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially to jealousy women over 40, who are waiting some miracles to happen. the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continued to live, would that last? for how long? nobody knows. nonetheless, it's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later.... a year later maybe.

i had never seen a silent movie until july 24, 2005. i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it. i've seen thousands of movies. very few are hypnotic to me. i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable (ray liotta) to be hypnotic, so consider the source as you read this. i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was, who has been credited by many for launching hollywood. i had no idea what i was in for. two hours later, i snapped out of it, and realized i'd watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen, playing a role perfectly suited to her. imagine a movie fan in 1922, having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before. you would have to see her again and again. the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive. she was a poor squatter, couldn't speak the king's english, but you had to admire her. what a movie... time to start my mary pickford movie collection!

uneducated & defiant, beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man's land. spirited & bold, she captures the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror & sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness.mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid, heart-wrenching film. she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the spunky joy & enthusiasm which made her for years the world's most popular movie star. the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale, with mary the lovely, distressed heroine beset by all manner of dangerous, stressful situations. the atmospherics are first-rate, with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived.in the supporting cast, jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him. hersholt, a very gentle soul off screen, manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption.this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess. a 1914 version had been one of her first important films, but its production values were a bit antiquated by the standards of the 1920's (no close-ups, for instance) and mary, producing her own films & powerful enough by 1922 to make whatever film she wanted, decided for the only time in her career to remake a film. the end result certainly lived up to her expectations. both films were very popular at the box office.a fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of christianity in mary pickford's life; it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced. although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today, we are compelled to accept them as sincere reflections, by their very repetition, of mary's heartfelt beliefs. in tess, one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard: pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible. she indicates to lloyd hughes (who plays her sweetheart) a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand. he mimes it for her (the word is obviously `crucified') and, eyes turned heavenward as the full meaning of the sacrifice dawns upon her, mary's face becomes positively beatific.a splendid new orchestral score for tess has been supplied by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty & pathos of this wonderful film.

here is proof of why mary pickford was `america's sweetheart.' in this rather complex drama, mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the `hill-toppers.' the scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful. she is even willing to take a bath. that mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature (5').tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges. she does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time. tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone. why she agrees to help the `hill-topper' daughter is beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret. pickford's close ups are wonderful.danish-born jean hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. the scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen. if forrest robinson (who plays daddy skinner) had worn a beard, he would have been a match for the model used in those world war i recruiting posters of uncle sam  wants you!although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure `americana.' the film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real christian. recommended.

i thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends. i laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time. it was just really touching. although not a new concept this was a very well made film.

as the story in my family goes, my dad, milton raskin, played the piano for the dorsey band. after sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours on end. then, at a point in time, my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group (band), and that he should venture off on his own. by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt' to do just that! dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history.i have some pictures and records to that effect, and so does berkley university in california.i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say, and his movies never get old . . . thank you frank

as with most of eleanor powell's films, this one plays out along the flimsiest of plots. for some reason -- oh it is explained! -- she's selected to transport a magnetic mine to cuba. good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is who gets confusing. but, as always, powell's dancing is superb and worth the price of admission. and in this one lahr plays his cowardly lion, evoking warm memories of that technicolor film of 1939. a fringe benefit is hearing a young frank, with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned for his wise-guy persona later on. in addition, the great drummer, buddy rich, has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity. watch particularly for his unique duet with dorsey's trumpet man, ziggy elman. i say "unique" perhaps in ignorance, but i know of no other drum/trumpet sequence like this one on film or records. this film is fun. even skelton's goofy persona is relatively restrained. powell shows again that she is the greatest film dancer ever.

ok - i admit. i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.starting out, we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie. one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married. a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about. the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's.they are almost the "first wives club", and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex's involved as well as some "he left the credit card" behaviour. characters set - the movie continues.mcdowell's character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (doughty) catches her eye. what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief? will they live happily ever after?a tissue or two recommended if you're the teary type - the end uplifting, but maybe not what you'd expect. all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action, special effects and schlock horror.

the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell, abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra, featuring ziggy elman, buddy rich and frank sinatra. red skelton shares top billing with powell, and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes, although skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, performs as powell's love interest, with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion. the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills, and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision. director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal, and permits powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair, as is appropriate.

what fun! bucketfuls of good humor, terrific cast chemistry (skelton/powell/lahr/o'brien), dynamite dorsey-driven soundtrack! miss powell's dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz. her most winning film appearance.

"ship ahoy" was probably made in order to showcase mgm talent. the film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to san juan, puerto rico, at the time in which the country was involved in wwii. this was typical fare for the studios, which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living.the beautiful eleanor powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with. red skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning, as he pursues the beautiful ms. powell on the ship that is bringing them to puerto rico. the irresistible bert lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man. also virginia grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone.there are good musical numbers featuring tommy dorsey and his orchestra, in which one sees, among others, the amazing buddy rich, who has a few solos with mr. dorsey and ms. powell. a young frank sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band, backed by the pied pipers.this is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre, which mgm totally controlled.

crush provides a combination of drama, humor and such irony that i find the english establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart. mostly known for directing john mckay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three forty-something friends in a small town in england. all three professional women down-out of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin, fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos. andie macdowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the british (which is where i find she exudes the most) is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man. small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great supporting cast) conflicts with her relationship. unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness. keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that. this is the type of film you either love or hate, which is why i believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released. as i'm sure most are just unearthing the film now. i very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as "love actually", and "three weddings and a funeral". not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments.

this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics don't usually "get" offbeat films, i thought i'd give it a try. unfortunately they were largely right in this instance.the film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting. the sort of feel that is impossible to describe, but it's not a good one. to further confound things, the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting.the immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact. hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script. it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurman.one thing the "esteemed" film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny. whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashed...ahem...front bottoms.because of the chortles acheived throughout, while i wouldn't recommend this film, there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different.

this was an excellent film. i don't understand why so many people don't like it. there was so much in it to connect with, so many beautiful images, and so much compassion in the things that weren't said. i was thoroughly entertained, and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance, just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story. now i haven't read this particular book of robbin's, so i don't now how this matched up, but i can't imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation. the movie left a lot for you to define yourself, which is the best part of any tom robbins novel, dreaming up the details. to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever, i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts. far from the worst ever this movie was glorious. long live the whooping crane.

kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star, even though he keeps his pants on.the movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life. i don't think i can think of another movie, except perhaps zeffirelli's romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that well.the other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously. in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery, without the mayhem.this is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages.

i admit, the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues, i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard. but now after viewing it the 7th time, i admit that it has very much grown on me. the characters of sissy, ms. jellybean, and the countess have become very endearing. and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet. though the plot is very weak, i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it. then there's the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k.d. lang (who reminds me a little of patsy cline) at her best. i can't think of any movie that has "grown on me" after an inauspicious first impression, as much as cowgirls has.

worst movie of all time? wow, whoa now. you cannot be serious.maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you. i live in oregon, so i got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than "average" score.or .... maybe it's all about what expectations you have. having read the book ages ago, and thinking to myself "goodness, no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, weird book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (morays -- can't put in the accent mark online) have changed" -- i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again.sissy was exquisitely cast, and i don't care what you all say, i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix's and john hurt's performances. i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans, but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray -- and those "real" folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted. stilted a bit, stage-ey -- always a bit "on." gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book, imho.

the film is exceptional in it's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast. throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character. her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful. in a way it's a slacker movie for girls. watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie. buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined (?).

i saw this movie the first seconds the voice of t.r. took me on to the journey - well i disliked the big glued thumbs in the beginning, but the absurd humor it and the gordious looks of both sissy actors - i do not know who played the young her - but she was great and so was uma!!! -the two other people who where in the cinema went out after about half an hour, i was with a friend - and it is always a test to watch a movie i like good with one of my friends - and, we both enjoyed it too the maximum - hilarious laughs - sadness about the "realistic police- normalos" . both of us fans of t.robbins books...i found it well done - thought, that robbins would also approve, though i do not have an idea if he likes the film or not...i would love to see the cut out stuff - i heard that gus v. sand had to take out lots of scenes because of the first-time viewers (or the producers???) well still it is an artistic movie. much too short though... it is one of my all time favorites - and i am aware of it that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and assume that people who enjoy that films are whatever they think .......what a pity. hopefully there will come the day that there will be a dvd with the full material - hoping to see more of crispian, keanu - expecting to see her baby and allif you have the chance to see it, think twice, and enjoy it if you made the choice to watch ... m

if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art. the actors and the direction of this film are both good. the only trouble with the film, as i can see it, is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.given both the irreverence of today's movies, as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre, i think "even cowgirls... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released.

i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is. i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and can't suspend reality and/or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives! get a grip people. ecgtb is a very entertaining movie. if you take movies seriously, this is not for you. if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way, this is not for you. but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert, or the "what the hell am i watching" of moulin rouge. or the gross out comedy of "the sweetest thing" then let yourself escape to cowgirls. it has some really funny parts. hilarious actually. it also has some really good music;kudos to kd.lang. also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman.....need i say more?

gus van sant has made some excellent films. i truly am a fan.however, i can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book "even cowgirls get the blues" is lost in translation to the big screen. alone, tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent. ultimately though this one just didn't work. it wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive. it's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this. we're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author's precision. movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience. this is what i believe happened here.i suggest reading the book!

i could not agree less with the rating that was given to this movie, and i believe this is a sample of how short minded most of spectators are all over the world. really... are you forgetting that cinema used to be a kind of art before some tycoons tried to make it only entertainment? this movie is not entertainment, at least not that easy entertainment you get on movies like titanic or gladiator. it has style, it is different, it is shocking... that's why most of you have hated it so much: because it does not try to be pleasing to you. it's just a story, a very weird one i admit, but after all, only a weird story. it is not a great story, not even a great cinema work, but i believe it is worth a 7-stars rating only for the courage of both author and director to shot a story that is not made to please the audience, thus selling billions of copies and making the big studios even richer. this movie is, for me, european-artistic-like movie made in the us, and everyone involved in the making of it deserves respect. be it for the courage, or be it for the unique sense of humor.

having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant, poignant and enriching film. the casting was excellent. i loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places, (but this is a film). the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly, as real life can and does. yes, i thought andy macdowell was great. i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities (i find this quite wierd because she's always a solid actress in my opinion).i loved the bit at the end where andy's character said "sometimes i feel he was never here" etc., it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which i can personally identify with), then there was that gorgeous classical piece "nocturne" i think by chopin, which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary).i say "well done" to the film makers - i have seen 1,000s of worse films!

well, well....roeg touched a bit of a nerve there, didn't he? he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters' descents into psychosis for a couple of decades, but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even some good advice) might be found in the bad old catholic church, the hipper-than-thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious. worse still, theresa russell's character - faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for, is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. you know, the realm of the ignorant and superstitious, the sort of thing that the art-house cinephiles are supposed to be above. oh, the horror... so she finds her marriage - the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment - affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention. people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives. but they probably won't. sure, this film has some problems, notably talia shire's delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun, 1950s-style attire and all. and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations (though hitchcock's movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst). but, sadly, nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents.

after reading the other tepid reviews and comments, i felt i had to come to bat for this movie.roeg's films tend to have little to do with one another, and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark.what this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith. the only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be tolkin's `the rapture.'i am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural. it is a simple movie about catholic faith, miracles, and redemption--though you would never guess it till the end. it is also the only movie i can think of whose resolution turns, literally, on a pun.as a (happily) fallen catholic myself, i know what the movie is about, and i find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between god and man. but if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based, then it will go right over you head.as a film-as opposed to a story-`cold heaven' it is not ground-breaking. while `the rapture' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery, `cold heaven' downplays its own cinematic qualities. there are no striking shots, no edgy effects, no attempts to fit the content to the form. it is workmanlike shooting, but subdued. nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama. it is a simple story that unfolds simply. it may seem odd; but at the end the mystery is revealed. it looks ambiguous; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of catholic dogma.in this regard, `cold heaven' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like `the sting,' or `the sixth sense,' or `final descent,' or polanski's `a pure formality.' all of these are films with a trick up their sleeves. they may frustrate you along the way, but they have a point-an obvious one, indeed--but the fun is, at least in part, in having been taken in.still, even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line, it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you. try it-especially if you are, or have ever been, a catholic.

this is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. if you enjoyed, "four weddings and a funeral", "peter's friends", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. made me laugh, made me sad. i view movies for entertainment, and english-set movies generally fit that bill for me. enjoy!

i really truly enjoyed this movie. (which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site!) i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy saturday night. it is funny, poignant, and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others! (fess up ladies, we have all been there!) bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it. (and truly, there is the best "wedding escape" that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone i have ever known!) you will laugh and you will cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office. (now i have to look around to purchase a copy!)

i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film. i thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. andie macdowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. for once, the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film. the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well. her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. imelda stalinson, who has been a mvp in so many british films, does a great job in this. there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting, clean direction, and witty writing.the film quality is excellent and the music is good, too, though unavailable on sound track.

very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. i can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. this film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.

i have seen maslin beach a couple of times - both on free to air tv in brisbane. i won't go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this.i will say that it is so australian. only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born, and to view it on free commercial television.i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country. sex and the city and huff are just too examples.despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state, it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie

this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend. there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here. the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types. the australian coast scenery is, simply, splendid to see. what a place to visit, to say the least, and one day it may become my hideaway. i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more. i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them. although the plot is somewhat soft, this movie is, of course, a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.

maslin beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of adelaide, on the fleurieu peninsula, in south australia. it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location.maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy. this could be slightly misleading, as it is not a 'hilarious' film, nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense, but it does have light-hearted moments. much as life itself, there are also moments of sadness too. it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above, and nudity runs throughout the length of film. the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal, and concentrate on the plot, not the copious amount of flesh.simon and marcie (michael allen and eliza lovell) arrive by car at a beach-side car park. they take their belongings to the beach, and while they are walking, a voice-over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is. the rest of the film is an exploration of this, framed by one complete day at the beach. the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life, but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes.when they arrive at the beach, both simon and marcie appear bored with each other. marcie sees them as a 'romeo and juliet' romantic couple. simon is just bored with it all. next, we are introduced to gail (bonnie-jaye lawrence), paula (zara collins) and jenny (jennifer ross). they are walking down the beach together discussing gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man, aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother. however, there are many more interesting people on the beach, not all of them 'attractive' and young (part of the realism of this film).to service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent, short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van. this is ben (gary waddell), who is a friend of simon, and is also his unofficial counsellor. i would think that this character is the main comic element. it is hard to say though, as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud, unless you were intoxicated, male and very young! maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though, and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject. as the quality of acting is variable, the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap, the lack of continuity is a positive boon. in fact, there is something about this film (not the nudity) that i find appealing. it is hard to define what it is, but it could be something to do with its bluntness, and downright 'aussie' attitude to carnal matters.the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention. sometimes it is very good, with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach, cliffs and a sunset. as nudity is a major factor in this film, framing is an important aspect of the camera work. there is no sense of gratuity in the framing, meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts. this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space', and makes the film more tasteful. not an easy task, given the location for filming.maslin beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post-pubescent, testosterone charged males, nor a 'mills and boon' romance for under-appreciated women. maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre. the actors are not 'attractive' in the baywatch sense, and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere. it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement, other than perhaps to naturists. apart from the australian accent, the filming could have been in any sunny country. what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless (cinema verite?), and only australian cinema, and other medium sized national cinemas, could consider such a rash option. at the same time, these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity, and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much. it is always possible, given that maslin beach is now a collector's item, that the film might become internationally popular, but it is very unlikely.during this critique, i have been sounding highly negative, at times, about maslin beach. this is not the real position, as i found the film very easy to watch. i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people (and problems). the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday, and a little low on spectacle. this does it no harm in my view, and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this. there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe, and with french film in particular. they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes, but with the everyday. hollywood is in direct opposition to this, and rides the crest of the hyper-real action/drama/angst wave. the pace too, is much faster in hollywood, but it is not reality. maslin beach is not exactly 'jacques tati' either, but it is on the right track, even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism, equality, gender orientation and so on, that are of such importance in current cinema. i am sure that you will either love or hate this film, with little room for a middle ground.

brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down. we expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford, the town nerd. the movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.

this is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. and, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, a yank at oxford. both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. in this film, william haines is "tom brown" and his main rival, "bob" is played by frances x. bushman. and, in a supporting role is jack pickford--always remembered as the brother of mary. of these three, pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game! all the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. however, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.in my opinion, for a better silent college film, try harold lloyd's the freshman--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown. the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in westpoint and the smart set, among others)--and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. well made, but certainly not original! and, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films.4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920!! talk about over-rated! there are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess.

i've been intrigued by this film for a while, in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb -- a 9.0 average with over 300 votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film! how had i not heard of this film before this website? well, you can't always trust the ratings. this is actually a very good film, preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication -- excellent acting by the principals, especially william haines as brown, and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard/yale football game -- but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in 1926. obnoxious, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place, becoming in the process a caring, self-sacrificing friend; i doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few reels, the predictability factor is high. still, it starts out very well, and is certainly deserving of being remembered, if not praised to the heavens. maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly harvard men...edit now 600+ voters and the score has actually climbed to 9.2! seriously, folks, there is ballot-stuffing going on here - i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than "metropolis" or "the general"!

this is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly. it seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles. it would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded. william haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. the gay subtext in his relationship with jack pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where haines rubs pickford's chest (pickford has a cold). both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very moving. and i never thought i could get so involved in a football match as i did in this movie - and i don't even understand the rules! also excellent is francis x. bushman's son ralph as haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). wonderful silent classic - a great example of twenties commercial cinema with an edge.

one of the biggest hits of 1926, brown of harvard is a exciting comedy/drama featuring regatta and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star. it's patented haines all the way: brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone wises up and becomes a man/hero and wins the girl. no one worked this formula like haines. a terrific comic actor (little annie rooney with mary pickford, show people with marion davies), haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines (with lon chaney) and west point (with joan crawford), where he repeats the formula. mary brian is good as the girl, jack pickford is very good as the sickly roommate, ralph bushman is the rival. edward connelly, mary alden, david torrence, guinn williams, and grady sutton co-star. this film is noted now for its homoerotic relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne's film debut as a yale football player (but i never spotted him). haines was a top-five box office star starting with this picture through 1932. it's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost. he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time.

farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post-angel's career confounding us, with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades. but when it comes down to it, there's no denying that this girl can act. far from a story of epic proportions, this well-done tv-movie is gentle, quiet and occasionally moving. fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral, much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister. brad johnson plays the love interest, and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama- but then there's always that confounding farrah to watch, and she does, indeed, remain eminently watchable. (and, yes, i admit it, i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when). silk hope gets three and a half stars (out of five) on the corkymeter. bosley would be proud.

this is a pleasant film, even if the premise is silly. it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film (another example is joe vs. the volcano). that's what makes her a star, in part. walter matthau, of course, had that ability, too, and he really puts himself into the role, making an amusing, good-hearted einstein. i suppose you could say they're both good at portraying loveable characters, though loveable in different ways (loveable young women vs. loveable curmudgeon).

iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen. plot is a typical guy wrong for girl, guy gets girl format, but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind. addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. overall, a good movie. not great, but good

"a little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men."if you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with acute eye for detail.walter matthau, meg ryan, tim robbins - et al - just wonderful!rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. enjoy yourself. then, thank me.

this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein, played wonderfully by walter matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (meg ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (tim robbins). the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors. this movie is cute and fun ... a "feel-gooder"! hearty recommendations.

i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it. einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better.the story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be einstein's niece. with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics, ed embarks on a quest to win catherine's heart. throw a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun.the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. stephen fry is a joy as the "rrratman" and ryan's fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body.the film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. it features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.

while fred schepisi's "i.q." doesn't really have any important qualities, it's still worth seeing. walter matthau plays albert einstein, trying to help mechanic ed walters (tim robbins) fall in love with princeton mathematics doctoral candidate catherine boyd (meg ryan). probably the funniest scene is when dr. frizzyhead and friends (lou jacobi, gene saks and joseph maher) try to make ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a french impressionist.obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. it's not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of robbins's most famous movie from 1994 (the shawshank redemption). a movie about einstein's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the scottsboro nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the fbi kept a file on him).so anyway, this one is acceptable. also starring stephen fry, tony shalhoub, frank whaley, charles durning and keene curtis.

this was a great romantic comedy! historically inaccurate (einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb) but he made a great matchmaker. he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. the supporting cast (lou jacobi, joseph maher, gene saks, stephen fry, etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. and did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly, the professor never wore socks! (two new entries for the imdb goofs section.) historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. i give it an 8!

this movie had me smiling from beginning to end, partly at the humor, partly at meg ryan (this is the perfect character for her), and always because it's just one of the best feel-good movies i've seen. hopefully the dvd will be out soon.

a solid, if unremarkable film. matthau, as einstein, was wonderful. my favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie.

what a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack. einstein is brilliantly acted by walter matthau, while meg ryan's catherine is unforgettable  better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom hanks  as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized.you don't need to be a young woman to understand catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately, and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through ed's (tim robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. there's universal appeal in these emotions, even if i.q. keeps it all light, fun and tied up nicely.sure it's not heavy, but if you look there are some subtexts. people remember albert einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings such as something along the lines of, 'if it is not impossible, then why do it?' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp. in this film, there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying catherine away from stiff-upper-lip, loveless james (stephen fry  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. how much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see, and comes across as serendipitous?and of course, we'd like to think in real life, despite what we often observe of the people we know, that we edwards get the catherines and jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins. how nice to know that it might work out in i.q.'s innocent (and disturbingly, exclusively caucasian) eisenhower-era land of make-believe.

this movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedy, which is thoroughly enjoyable. meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein, though she does believe in her own skills. tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up. i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein. this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it, while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible, it happens here).i personally found this movie extremely entertaining, especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. if you have a cheeky sense of humour, this is the movie for you!

the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says - "is the piston firing short?" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. very lovable and very intelligent too. her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. it's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt. i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. great movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!

iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as cupid's helpers. the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love, but at other times, you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age. the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. walter matthau is a perfect einstein, meg ryan creates a quirky, scatter-brained mathematician, and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. all together, they create a farcical trip through love and science, mind and heart.

it was a doubly interesting experience. for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie*. the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar, where (like a "deus ex ma-china") the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show, so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all, and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, intent on stealing some machines of theirs. it is notable that in those two cases, and in iq, we are dealing with comedies. so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein, like john huston's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff. i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog. but then, only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind. maybe nobody really has tried.(*subsequently, after writing this, i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago. but that is an exception and it was a spoof.)the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert. it was walter matthau, here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers. matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor, in both comedy and drama, but normally his comic personas were variants of his "whiplash willie" gingrich from the fortune cookie. they were connivers and gonifs. later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them, but they remained grumpy types. but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet. more like his kotch than like willie clarke.he plays albert as good old uncle albert. it seems that matthau's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd (meg ryan), and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland (stephen fry). but fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters (tim robbins) works. robbins falls for ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires. good old uncle albert, aided by his three friends (lou jacobi, joseph maher, and gene saks) decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius. this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan, provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do).the atmosphere is sweet, as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on (by switching the positions of their bodies). the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower (keene curtis).it was a charming comedy, and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal, but far more subdued.

while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie, the supporting cast (including matthau, fry, shalub, durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi, saks and maher) is an additional plus. matthau shines as einstein, fry is perfect as ryan's clinical fiancé, and shalub's line about einstein's gonads is, as has been noted, one of the highlights of the film. the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry. kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity. i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower. this might be considered something of a chick movie, but i think everyone will get a kick out of it. eight very solid points.

this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant. in order to get the two together, einstien agrees to help ed(hudsucker proxy's tim robbins) learn to act more intelligent. this impresses catherine (meg ryan). unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius. hilarity ensues. not to be missed. filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university, lawrenceville prep school (doubling for princeton university) as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell.

being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, and therefore having seen a large number of these films, it is rare that one strikes me as totally unique. for that matter, it is equally rare that i am gasping for breath through the laughter during several scenes. the love story is a little thin on the ground, but i'd say that's probably for the best, as this romantic comedy has the emphasis firmly on "comedy", and in any case it stretches the bounds of credibility just a little more than i like most rom com's to do. the four scientists provided some of the funniest moments not just in this film, but in any film i've seen in a long while. i hesitated for the briefest of moments before finally choosing a "10" over a "9" as a rating, as i believe that far too many people use it indiscriminately, and therefore the maximum rating loses some of its impact. i'm also a big meg ryan fan, which helps, but this is one of the few films i've seen in which i'd say she is comprehensively overshadowed. she and tim robbins are cast as the leads, but for me play second fiddle to the antics of the bumbling intellectuals. a genuine laugh-out-loud type film.

this movie is so great. its set back in probably the 40's and meg ryan's character struggles to be known as 'smart.' plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie. and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it. everytime i watch it i feel happy. it's definitely a girl movie, and i'm a girl, so i like it. i also love the music. the violin is awesome. but besides that i think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it.

i.q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. if you ask me, james (stephen fry) really was a dull guy. to me, ed (tim robbins) was more suited for catherine (meg ryan) than james was. anyway, everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it. you're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.

this is a really fun, breezy, light hearted romantic comedy. you cannot go wrong with meg ryan's cute perkiness combined with albert einstein's genius. normally, i'm not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people, now deceased and not able to defend themselves, but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one.it's the 1950's...princeton, new jersey in the spring. the story revolves around a pretty, young, scatter brained mathematician, catherine (meg ryan), who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk, a behavioral researcher named james, merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children. however, it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed (tim robbins). as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than albert einstein, plays match maker, assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies, all theoretical physicists. uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart, so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicist...naturally with amusing results.walter matthau is his usual hilarious self, and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively. with his three professorial buddies, kurt, nathan, and boris, a lot of laughs ensue. the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one (outrageous) step further. if you suspend all logic, you can almost imagine this silly story happening!it might not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it is a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. one of the best of the comedy romance genre.

bottom line - best romantic comedy ever. this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for: the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race. when i am blue, this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh (and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh).all of the actors are in top form. the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with matthau, robbins and ryan). the supporting cast is consistently brilliant: fry ("agae", "a total pygmy package"!), jacoby & saks & maher (the three theoretical physicists as "greek chorus" - "but time doesn't exist"), durning ("something we can launch from nj"), shalhoub & whaley (robbins' boss and co-worker at the service station), and curits (eisenhower - how many comedies have eisenhower??).don't miss this overlooked treasure.

fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any cuter. all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp. of course, in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey, but that is why i love romantic comedies....one can just totally forget reality and have a good time. nice film. damn, meg is a babe, eh?

australian fred schepisi (a cry in the dark) directs this comedy/ romance that is fun, relaxing, and set in the spring. you will laugh while watching this movie. tim robbins (shawshank redemption, dead man walking) is an auto mechanic, ed walters, with a high iq, which gets higher with the help of albert einstein, walter matthau (grumpy old men) and his academic friends nathan, kurt and boris. you can tell them by their preppie shoes. meg ryan (sleepless in seattle, you've got mail) is catherine boyd, einstein's niece who is a competent, but not so confident mathematician. perhaps it is because she is surrounded by all that genius. she thinks that if she marries someone with a high i.q. her kids will have a high i.q. as well, but she does not knows what she wants. between tim robbins cute smile and meg's cuteness this is a refreshing movie. i love sweet stories. people all ages should enjoy this movie. catherine is engaged to the jerk james moreland, who works in animal behavior, but is very stuffy. this is a love a first sight type situation, between the mechanic and the mathematician. witty lines and subliminal lines! the cinematography is nice. princeton, new jersey is beautiful in the spring. with much help from all those brilliant men catherine falls for ed, without knowing that he is an automobile mechanic.favorite scenes: ed taking a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of einstein, nathan, kurt, and boris. ed and einstein riding on the motorcycle. nathan, kurt and boris letting all the research animals free!favorite quotes: albert einstein: "don't let your brain interfere with your heart". ed walters: "when was the last time he said "wahoo""? catherine boyd: "well i'm sure i don't know". this is a refreshing movie, i recommend it. i have the tape and every once and awhile i will watch it again.

this is one of my all time favorites. it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it... one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters "are you thinking what i'm thinking" and ed says "now what are the odds of that happening!" in my opinion, a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it, and with this one, you can!! i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein. i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely. there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it! i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then!

i recently saw i.q. and even though i'm not a romantic comedy type of gal, i think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch. so many movies in my opinion lack honesty. you know that feeling when you're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash? the story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. how they stuck together and they tried to help tim robbins character become smart. i liked the love story between tim and meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love, "nothing is what it seems". i would recommend this for a sunday morning.7/10

i just watched i. q. again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie. it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with "einstein" playing "twinkle, twinkle little star" on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters. i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set. (i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber.) it's wonderful how a man who is "only a grease monkey" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. the message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. there are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. in the next camera shot, there only 2. in the credits on our video, it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters, not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb.i highly recommend this movie. it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. not only that, what a great cast is assembled here. watch it and enjoy!

maybe i'm being too generous with the rating...but i just love this movie! i've seen it so many times, but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again. it's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or monumentous that happens. but i'm a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic. i love meg ryan and tim robbins, and walter mathau is so funny. the scientists make me laugh so much...i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. it's such a clean, good movie - and those are so rare now! my 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it's not just a chick-flick. ;-) i recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you're just lonely and need to *watch* a romance, if you yourself can't participate in one. it's a good 'un!

while this movie's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been, this is still a very good film. in fact, it was seen as an excellent film in its day, as it was nominated for the first best picture oscar (losing to wings). i still consider wings to be a superior film, but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead, emil jannings.jannings is a general from czarist russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a hollywood extra. his luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call--to play an imperial russian general fighting against the communists during the revolution. naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise, but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution.exactly what happens next i'll leave to you, but it's a pretty good film--particularly at the end. by the way, look for william powell as the russian director. despite being made in 1928, with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.

russian emigrant director in hollywood in 1928 (william powell) is casting his epic about the russian revolution, and hires an old ex-general from the czarist regime (emil jannings) to play the general of the film, and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared (evelyn brent), of 11 years before.try as i might, i feel it hard to warm to 'the last command' for all its virtues. 'the docks of new york' was indubitably a great film, and 'underworld' is a film i have always been craving to see, but 'the last command' is rather heavy-going. the premise is fascinating, but the treatment does really make the script come to life, except in the sequences set in hollywood, depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state-of-the-art technology.emil jannings is, predictably, a marvelous russian general, distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex-general, transfixed in his misery, and the vigorous, hearty officer of yore.the ending is great and worth the wait, but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times.

the last command (1928) is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg.it shows us czarist general, grand duke sergius alexander (emil jannings) in his days of glory.in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing.he also had the love of a woman, natalie dabrova (evelyn brent).about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.his old enemy lev andreyev (william powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.the last command is very good silent drama.emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead.evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.william powell is great as always.there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.like many scenes with jannings and brent.and then there is the ending with powell and jannings.this is a movie that touches in many parts.

1927, and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade. now that it had become the site of a multi-million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established, some of those in the calmer quarters of this film-making factory were taking the time for a little self-reflection. the last command, while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times, frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality, and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal. it was written by lajos biro, who had been on the scene long enough to know.taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood's most celebrated immigrants  emil jannings. before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy, being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well-timed performance, often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has-beens. he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter, and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings's scenery-chomping caricatures. however, as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range, showing by turns delicate frailty, serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale. he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration (the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety), but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance.the director was another immigrant, albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry. nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister (the "von" was made up, by the way), and took a very distinctive approach to the craft. of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone, a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes. we open with a carefully-constructed chaos with movement in converging directions, which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen. then, when jannings arrives, everything settles down. jannings's performance is incredibly sedate and measured, and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order.sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence, allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen, and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic. in fact, he really seems to have an all-round lack of interest in action. in the scene of the prisoners' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance, his camera eventually retreating to a fly-on-the-wall position. compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent, which are a complex medley of point-of-view shots and intense close-ups, thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction.as a personality on set, it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell, and in fact powell's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on. unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with, and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones, the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired. while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically, it appears no-one told his co-stars they were not in a comedy. evelyn brent is fairly good, giving us some good emoting, but overplaying it here and there. the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself. it's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless, like a male ninotchka, but he does a good job, revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard-hearted exterior.the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices, as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film-making process, even a relatively tame example like this. at the very least, i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the "behind-the-scenes" view, as it threatened the mystique of movie-making which was still very much alive at this point. as it turned out, such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor, as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and (according to some sources, although the issue is a little vague) a nomination for best picture. this is significant, since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self-indulgent back-slapping by the hollywood elite. but elite or not, they recognised good material when they saw it, and were willing to reward it.

josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there. emil jannings won a well-deserved oscar, in part, for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general. the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to revolutionaries. william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film. the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes tinseltown in the early days. von sternberg delivers yet another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.

an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution. however, he is not any ordinary extra. he is serguis alexander, former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene, which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in, to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander. it can now be the time for this broken man to finally "win" his penultimate battle. this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg, providing the greatest irony in alexander's character in every way he can. jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley. powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings' love. all around brilliance. rating, 10.

i like peter sellers, most of the time. i had never seen him portray an upper-class brit until this movie. he pulls it off pretty well, although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix. it doesn't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives.i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance. her timing was great and her expressions were priceless. the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch. verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era.the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat. it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty. hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on. enjoy it...

i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off. peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn (who wouldn't?). the way that goldie's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today. this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny. peter sellers role was a difficult sell, but i think he pulls it off well.

not sure why it doesn't play in peoria, apparently, but this is a very funny, clever british comedy. it's set at the end of the "swinging sixties". peter sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-something serial womaniser. the perfectly delectable goldie hawn, playing a 19 year american girl in london, is, initially, sellars' "catch of the day". but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond.humour, pathos, great script, strong performances from the leads and supporting caste.it's a great film, and the best gag is the very last line.try it, you'll like it.

eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia, a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick, fast-talking, charming womanizer raymond (an amazing wesley snipes) and boorish, surly, racist biker bloss (a terrific william forsythe), who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with. joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving, but married girlfriend anna (radiantly played by helen hunt). but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own.this remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. directors neil jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste, wit and warmth, specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle, including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). besides the expected poignancy, the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw, earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: stoltz, snipes, forsythe and hunt are all outstanding, with stand-out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss' doting, amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses. despite the grim subject matter, the film ultimately proves to be a very moving, positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. a simply wonderful little gem of a drama.

this work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. this film never tries to tone it down, cotton candy-ize, or soft soap the angst, confusion, and pain of what these guys live with. that is its strength, i think.but more so, the performances are fantastic, with well conceived and delivered dialog, which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience. the characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what's on their mind-what's in their hearts.i found it plodding, but enjoyable.it rates a 6.6/10 from...the fiend :.

i recently got the chance to view "the waterdance", and quite liked it. i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there, except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end. we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie, invalids in a hospital. the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story.unfortunately, you don't get to see movies like that today. im not "stuck in a time warp", im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there's much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998.

i thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism. this movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable. the acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of "one flew over the cuckoo's nest".

this film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town, and the word-of-mouth buzz got me to see it. a comedy about disabled people - the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart-warming film.

touching and sad movie. portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident. the film centers on his relationship with his married lover, whom he is often very hostile towards, and his interactions with other accident victims, particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker. the film is often humorous, often sad, and always believable. get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner.

it's funny how your life can change in a second... to attend ''the waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on. eric stoltz's performances and mainly of helen hunt (oh man!, helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful, wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a brazilian expression...).

i know, that's not what you expect from a film with this sort oflineage- it's a direct descendant of the best years of our livesand the men... films dealing with men who are in the hospitaldealing with tragic circumstances. but this film is full of wonderfulsurprises and performances. it features stellar performances fromeric stoltz and helen hunt (including a rather risque nude scene)and wesley snipes and william forsythe. as emanuel levy wrotein his book cinema of outsiders (about the independent filmmovement) "the waterdance is coherant, attentive to detail, andunsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at oncefunny and sad, and the entire cast is impressive." i wasextraordinarily moved by this film, it's hard hitting yes, but also hasvery tender moments and laugh out loud moments. a rare gem.

_waterdance_ explores a wide variety of aspects of the life of the spinally injured artfully. from the petty torments of faulty fluorescent lights flashing overhead to sexuality, masculinity and depression, the experience of disability is laid open.the diversity of the central characters themselves underscores the complexity of the material examined - joel, the writer, raymond, the black man with a murky past, and bloss, the racist biker. at first, these men are united by nothing other than the nature of their injuries, but retain their competitive spirit. over time, shared experience, both good and bad, brings them together as friends to support one another.most obvious of the transformations is that experienced by joel, who initially distances himself from his fellow patients with sunglasses, headphones and curtains. as he comes to accept the changes that disablement has made to his life, joel discards these props and begins to involve himself in the struggles of the men with whom he shares the ward.the dance referred to in the title is a reference to this daily struggle to keep one's head above water; to give up the dance is to reject life. _waterdance_ is a moving and powerful film on many levels, and i do not hesitate to recommend it.

this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf , but it came on ifc one day and i said - eric stolz, william forsythe...why not? if i'd changed the channel, i would have really missed a treasure. the subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower-class rehabilitation center. it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear-jerker. but, that doesn't happen because it was written by neal jimenez, after he himself was accidently paralyzed. no hollywood happiness here. all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds, but they share a feeling of helplessness, of being at the mercy of others. stolz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend (helen hunt); wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies' man whose family is falling apart; but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence.see this film.

this film never received the attention it deserved, although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting, and one of the most realistic stories i have seen on screen. clearly filmed on a small budget in a real v.a. hospital, the center of the story is joel, very well-played by eric stoltz. joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident, and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries. joel is in love with anna, his married lover, played by helen hunt, who shows early signs of her later academy-award winning work.although the joel-anna relationship is the basic focus, there are many other well-developed characters in the ward. wesley snipes does a tremendous job as the angry raymond. even more impressive is william forsythe as the bitter and racist bloss. i think forsythe's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers, and, later, when he feels empathy for a young korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up. my favorite scene with snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options.the chemistry between stoltz and hunt is very strong, and they have two very intimate, but not gratuitous, sex scenes. the orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing. there is also another memorable scene where joel and bloss and the korean boy take the specially-equipped van to the strip bar. it's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the "naked ladies."the story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director, neal jimenez, is paralyzed in real life. this is basically his story. this film is real, not glossy or flashy. to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing. i recommend this film to everyone i see, because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look. it's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked, but through video, perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves.

always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(holly gooding),"skipped parts",2000, who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer, george newbern,(patrick highsmith),"far harbor",'96. many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father. if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture. if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern, this film should be seen only on halloween night! however, it sure has it's surprises in the end!!!!

there is a certain genius behind this movie. i was laughing throughout. the scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. the doppelganger split at the end was like... "ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say". certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. horribly bad, but good. i'm looking for other movies this person may have done (with more experience).

drew barrymore was excellent in this film. this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play. her typical role is as a woman looking for love. the storyline is also great.when holly is implicated in her mother's murder she moves to l.a. she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover. but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused. it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder. after that another woman becomes paranoid when she's around her. in the end though, they find out the truth.

when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany's, you know something is going to go right. drew barrymore, patrick highsmith, leslie hope, and sally kellerman are excellent actors. the fbi agent was a terrible actor. the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier, those was just weird. drew barrymore is very hot. intimate strangers, where sally kellerman worked, was a great part. the weird gummy worm was just weird. nathan was a very handsome cat. but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr. gooding attacked him? and the scene with dr. wallace? what was he doing fumbling around in there? and not every male has a female, as sally kellerman stated. and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor's, that was weird.

i liked it! the plot was weird, drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them. drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time. dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool, and as always he does his best - i'm a major dennis fan anyway, that's why i bought the dvd.i didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool, which is ok i guess but it could have been more. ....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc-or was it dennis all the time? because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick. in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice.the music was ok but obtrusive in places, the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude. all in all a bit of a gpm-guilty pleasure movie. don't read too much into it, don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it. there are some diamond moments and goofs galore- watch it and just have a bit of fun with it!

this film has a rotting core of flexible morality, and yet a quirky sense of justice. so many of the regular joes among us would love to "stick it to the man". the "man" in this case is represented by several different characters. mr. keller, who carla reports to at her office. later, paul owes 70 large to mr. marchand the club owner. and then there is paul's parole officer. there seems to be so much question about this last character's side story. reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists, escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. they are beholden to each agent of the "man". one or both could be fired, killed, or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told.the film has a sense of relief at the end. carla finally gets laid. her boss is forced out for being a jerk. mr. club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. they get the $money$. and... they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight. never mind that someone else may get paul's file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free! they might even get away with it! woohoo...they stuck it to the man!

it's so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn. surprises throughout delighting throughout.a couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays "the good girl, hard worker" and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker. that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me pause.the other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film. i never did get who he was or what his issues were. if anyone has any ideas, i'd like to hear what they might be.the film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing. very much worth seeing.

audiard made here a very interesting movie. it begins with the description of an almost-deaf young woman, in its working universe as a secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected... hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail. their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively. characters'description is profund, goes into details...both start to help each other; for she can read on lips, which reveals itself to be very useful for him...she will progressively evolve, far from what she was at first.it's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even if it turns into a film noir at the end. gesture is in particular beautifully observed in audiard's filming. emmanuelle devos should be nominated at the best actess cesar awards for her magistral play. action towards the end of the film prevents it from being a simple "etude de moeurs". it's actually surprisingly entertaining : 8/10.

my observations: vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. jeanette wore it well, and got even with naive nelson. boat crashing into his balcony served him right. costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did great job. main song theme just lovely.caution to negative posters: 1942 was time of ww ii; pearl harbor happened year before. u.s. just coming out of great depression; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing, dance and yes, fantastic fantasy. despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl, snuffing out freedoms. thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend. movie going was a privileged treat, in those depressing times. when you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and criticize. jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time.angel wings wonderful, on the real angel. rl wings at costume party not so hot, but great on jeanette considering the sl.beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson, as always. jeanette dancing was a pure delight.15/10

one used to say, concerning nathaniel hawthorne, that his failures were more interesting than his successes. i believe that the same remark could suit to mcdonald-eddy's pictures. and especially this one. it apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie: it's kitsch, the script, because of censorship, sounds inconsistent yet, this movie gets also some good points: good rodgers-hart's music ("i married an angel", "tira tira tira la"), good acting with e.e.horton and reginald owen. anyway, if you may dislike it, you can't forget it. this strange movie actually leaves a very strong, dreamlike, impression, and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days, maybe for weeks. why? in the thirties and the beginning of the forties, movies didn't have the same mean than today: it aimed, like a dream, to divert the public in order to make it forget a difficult reality. of all the the dream-movies that was made, in that time, this one stands as particularly powerful.in short, let's say that the better way to appreciate this movie, is to watch it without wondering whether it's good or bad. to watch it, like you would watch a dream.

the movie is a fantasy. the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully. (i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well.) some of the dialog is wonderfully clever. the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942.movies are designed to serve various purposes. this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does. if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count. some of the closeups made me uncomfortable. but he could still sing and sing magnificently. however, jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever. she makes a spectacular angel.this genre is well before my time, and i an new to the jeanette macdonald/nelson eddy films and related conversation. the music in this movie is beautiful. as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies, there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable, more delightful, better constructed. the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today. and jeanette macdonald, without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars i see today. i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies. they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is. and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what? i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten. there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed. i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent, great beauty and great music.

i know a lot of people don't like this movie, but i just think it is adorable. there's not much i can say, but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess. the songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie, especially as briggitta learns about the do's and don't's of society. if you like musicals, i'd say you'd like this one!

jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this "modern" musical that showcases macdonald's comic abilities. surreal 40s musical seem to be making fun of 40s fashions even as they were in current vogue. eye-popping costumes and sets (yes b&w) add to the surreal, dreamlike quality of the entire film. several good songs enliven the film, with the "twinkle in your eye" number a total highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes. also in the huge cast are edward everett horton, reginal owen, mona maris, douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys. also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale, almira sessions, grace hayle, gertrude hoffman, rafaela ottiano, odette myrtile, cecil cunningham and many others.great fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her jitterbug/vamp routines. she could do it all.

it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight. at one point, she gets to sing a snippet from carmen, followed by the final trio of faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then "aloha oe" on the beach! it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.

have never understood why the macdonald-eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. to me, "i married an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. the sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an mgm musical, the script is by the reliable anita loos ("san francisco," "the women," "gentlemen prefer blondes," etc.), the rodgers and hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by macdonald-eddy regulars bob wright and chet forrest) are given celestial treatment by herbert stothart (oscar-winner for scoring "the wizard of oz"), and best of all, the "singing sweethearts" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. try to show "rose marie" or "sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still, but this offbeat, fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain.

what can you say when you see a good french movie which tries to draw a suspenseful story in line with the social background of the characters? the major point is we believe in those characters and once they've met each other we want them to stay together. it's simple and really efficient. the background story is less important. why does the screenplay go on the side of a half-developed thriller? it helps not to get stuck in those social demonstrations most french film-jerkers like to make. not too much ambition, right: sur mes lèvres is only an entertaining french film with good characterization.for all the clever noir points in the screenplay the end is by far too easy. it goes quite as easy as in rear window (an obvious reference and definitely not a noir film) but with a less compelling context. where i am amazed it's to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. he brings very little to the story; when he appears alone we wonder if we've not missed a part before. jacques audiard is not a new-comer yet. strange and weird.

carla is a secretary who is essentially deaf without her hearing aids. when she finds herself overloaded at work, she is able to hire paul to help her out. paul is just out of jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. to say too much more about the story, which has many twists, would be a mistake.the most interesting thing about this film for me is how sound is used to indicate when carla can hear and when she can't -- a sort of "point of hear" (like point of view). the early scenes that set this up, as well as the early character development of carla and paul, was more interesting to me than the twists and turns later on, some of which were hard to follow and/or stretched credibility a bit. there is also some unpleasant violence. back to the positive side, the cinematography was very good.the film is worth seeing, but perhaps not seeking out. seen at the san francisco international film festival on 4/28/2002.

i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. it is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. she hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. the film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. the use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.

surely one the french films of the decade so far, a taut, atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema. emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning , multi-faceted performance, at times devious and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable. another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france.

vincent cassel plays the part of paul, an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets carla, a secretary who is quite deaf', when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not (played by emmanuelle devos). together they help each other to develop as people.what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes. paul appears uneasy in the office environment, is it that he's just not cut out for work? this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines.the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified.finally, it is a film full of great moments' both touching and humorous. one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby. she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort.

put yourself into carla's shoes. she is an overworked, unappreciated administrative drudge who is invisible. you know her: she's trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all of the bodies are buried and might even look back at you in the mirror when you brush your teeth. always having time for another thankless task and does it better than most despite a serious disability, she has the desk on the way to the restroom that becomes the repository of half-finished cups of coffee begging to be spilled. what? you don't want to hear it? well, she can't and neither can you until your hearing aid is in place. prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired.carla (emmanuelle devos) needs a change in her life. work is leading nowhere; friends are relying on her to meet their domestic needs and the only way out starts with a collapse that goes virtually unnoticed. she won't take a vacation - a contract is going critical - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. carla submits requirements that convey her real needs: a 'well-groomed' man. this brings an applicant for approval that reminds us that we should be careful with our wishes. paul (vincent cassell) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and his getting hired clearly demonstrates carla's interest in his non-job-related qualities. she sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of co-dependence. paul has a difficult transition returning to the world outside of prison walls and finds himself in another sort of prison: one of the office variety and another of indentured servitude to pay off an old debt. his skills as a thief help carla win a political battle in the office. but paul sees a grander opportunity with carla's skill in lip reading and draws her even further into a world of intrigue.this is a brutal film noir unrated and probably suitable for older teens. carla grows more powerful, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. she grows as a woman discovering her sensual side while she uses her resources to overcome the obstacles of competing in a man's world.the two main characters are meant for each other, in a strange way. without paul, carla will remain in her role of a doormat. she has our sympathy, hopes and best wishes even if she doesn't make the best decisions along the way. you will hear the world through carla's ears, from awkward adjustments of your hearing aid, muffled sounds, all but inaudible without it to relatively distinct voices when you can see who's talking. with one major sense disabled, we see carla's heightened intuitive power to compensate. and we can all use that sense to hear not only what people say, but also what they really mean.

i had never heard of leos carax until his merde segment in last years tokyo, and his was easily the stand-out the film's three stories. it wasn't my favorite of the shorts, but it was the most unique, and the most iconic. "the lovers on the bridge" was the first of his full length features i've seen, a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic. though he's classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue, his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives. his movies are closer to jean vigo in "l'atlante", jean cocteau, and guy maddin, than godard and truffaut.in boy meets girl carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states. he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin, but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau, but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible, emotional, and engaging like vigo's movies.the story of boy meets girl is simple, and similar to carax's two following films which comprise this "young lovers" trilogy. a boy named alex played by denis lavant (who plays a character named alex in carax's next two movies), has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend. in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder. he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex, and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate. he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment, but avoids contacting either of them directly. he wanders around and finds his way to a party, where he meets a suicidal young woman, and the film becomes part "breathless" and part "limelight".later he is advised by an old man with sign language to "speak up for yourself...young people today it's like they forgot how to talk." the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film, and how an actor timid off stage became a confident "lion" when in front of the camera. heres where the movie tips its hand, but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene, since it overlaps the style of the film (silent and expressionist), with the content (a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to). though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end, he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment, aside from a desire to fall in love.there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies, all crying in a chorus that fills that room, until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent. unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses. even as carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses. even the rich old, bell of the ball has a brother she misses. in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence.though indebted to films before talkies, carax is a master of music, knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy's "holiday in cambodia", or an early david bowie song, the sounds of a man playing piano, or of a girl softly humming.in boy meets girl, when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt, when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel, when alex enters a party an feels out of place, its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain, or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut. this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet, michel gondry, and wes anderson, whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy, all have a parallel with different visuals, musical, and emotional cues in these carax movies.every line of dialog, every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level, some i lack words to articulate. there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl, but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment. the other movies you want to watch can wait. see this first. if i were to make films, i would want them to be like this, in fact i wish all films were like this, where the ephemeral becomes larger than life, and life itself becomes a dream.

as in amelie, recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant, centered on a female finding her one true love. in this case, desperation leads to a convict, which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype. clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male.for those of us that don't speak french, the subtitles are a little quick, but not unreasonable.the soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with european films, is great and in perfect sync with the film's variations. nothing seems forced. visually, it reminds me of various urban horror movies. there's a wes craven in chicago feel to it.

what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters. this might require a bit of patience, especially since neither is "attractive" in the typical hollywood definition of such. however, once the "heist" kicks in, the film rushes forward quickly, perhaps at times too quickly. but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable. the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up.

perfect cast for a few-person drama. simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside. what he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by german avant-garde composer werner henze. simon is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side. his girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death. very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring.

deaf secretary carla (emmanuelle devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.when they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but, when the first applicant is ex-con paul (vincent cassel) she seizes the chance to change her life.carla covers his mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues.when paul asks carla to return the favor, she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld, ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand (olivier gourmet).recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no one will have bargained for, the two set out to see justice done.french filmmaker jacques audiard's third feature "read my lips" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller.

alain resnais films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited. love unto death is at times a quiet existential drama and a roundly creative magical realist movie, and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the eros/thanatos relationship... or perhaps creates a new relationship, that of agape/thanatos.the beginning is like a bizarre surrealist horror movie. a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed--did she kill him, or what happened? soon that tension is dissolved as a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead, but from there a newer, stranger drama begins: the man wakes up, and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences. meanwhile, their friends, who are both priests, watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love, faith, and devotion.resnais always seems to have some device to make these sorts of narratives work, and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work. in this case, resnais intercuts the scenes with shots of snow falling to an arousing orchestral score, which fades off and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story. trapped in this elegiac aside periodically, the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem, and i got strange flashbacks to dante's divine comedy from this one, despite the lack of direct reference within the movie. resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this extends past just the cinepoem structure to something that forces a degree of introspection in the viewer, which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd recollections. memory-narrative, resnais creates.--polarisdib

master cinéaste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family.in this film too we see resnais' family members like pierre arditi, sabine azema, andré dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death,religion,suicide,love and their overall implications on our daily lives.the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formal you.in 1984,while making l'amour à mort,resnais dealt with time,memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence :is love stronger than death ? it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories.message of this film is loud and clear :true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation.l'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped.

"read my lips (sur mes lèvres)" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its french title) is a nifty, twisty contemporary tale of office politics that unexpectedly becomes a crime caper as the unusually matched characters slide up and down an ethical and sensual slippery slope.the two leads are magnetic, emmanuelle devos (who i've never seen before despite her lengthy resume in french movies) and an even more disheveled than usual vincent cassel (who has brought a sexy and/or threatening look and voice to some us movies).the first half of the movie is on her turf in a competitive real estate office and he's the neophyte. the second half is on his turf as an ex-con and her wrenching adaptation to that milieu.writer/director jacques audiard very cleverly uses the woman's isolating hearing disability as an entrée for us into her perceptions, turning the sound up and down for us to hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when audience members talk), using visuals as sensory reactors as well.none of the characters act as anticipated (she is not like that pliable victim from "in the company of men," not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line (well, until the last shot, but heck the audience was waiting for that fulfillment) as we move from a hectic modern office, to a hectic disco to romantic and criminal stake-outs. there is a side story that's thematically redundant and unnecessary, but that just gives us a few minutes to catch our breaths.this is one of my favorites of the year! (originally written 7/28/2002)

this movie has great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme.. but all in all, i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it.. big, impressive, powerful, bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty.plot: a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will (not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer) when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend.. he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand, it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship....sword boy is on the planet for a reason.. he just doesn't know what it is.. yet.lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting filleted creatively.russain w eng subtitles.. slick worth a watch..

for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.that's because sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. sasha becomes an outlaw. while on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.as you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma. everything happens very slowly. however, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. the score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.is the film worth it? that is a question really difficult to answer. i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope. after all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together.

a woman borough a boy to this world and was alone. they both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm. there was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body. first he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time. then he grows up and decides to find his real father. just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice....but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right 'cause it is not like in hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - sasha (he is the main hero acted by artem tkachenko) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs. in such a runaway from authorities and mafia he meets a girl (acted by chulpan hamatova) and falls in love with her. everything else is to be watched...not told. be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions. this film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life.

i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift, who was made into a monster by society. suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got. but it was a happy surprise. my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. so in short: not what i expected, but a very good surprise indeed. i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd.

there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately.a friend, sends me movies now and again, as a surprise, it's awesome.i turned it on and couldn't stop watching, it is a drama, but with a odd twist. imagine if romeo, as in shakepeare, had a super power. it is sad and poetic at the same time. hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a spectacle. this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist. granted it's not perfect, but nothing ever is. you know what the power is but it is never explained, nor totally realized until the end. it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. i don't want to see a remake, it is too cool as is, the hollywood system would, as usual, mess it up. acting is top notch all around. directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there. kudos to all involved,and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic. a+++++if you can find i, watch it.

despite the title, the sword bearer, and the dvd cover (action/herioc poses of the sword bearer) this is not a super hero film.(minor spoilers) it follows the tale of sasha, the sword bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm. cool you say, but no, this is real life. if you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her. and if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12.this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him. wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like a bout de soufflé). he then meet katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways. however, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers.that is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested.i really like this movie. unlike many hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development.worth checking out if you can find it.

what happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers? the premise may sound familiar. the watchmen? unbreakable? however, the russian sci-fi action flick, the sword bearer, is far from the standard stock.the story revolves around a man named sasha who as a boy was shunned from society, his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess. when he wishes or his anger allows, a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin. very wolverinish? maybe... but that's not the interesting part of this film. shunned all his life and driven by anger (and a temper he does have) our "hero" returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to. the only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground. this is where the vengeance and anger comes into play. this is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail. he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about.the film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences. this is art house at it's core, beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action. it's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film. the directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of sasha and not a straight action film. don't worry though, the action is there and plenty of it. however, much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath. this is not to say that action is not shown. these scenes are here and are fantastic (especially the ending where we see sasha's full powers unleashed in desperation). the director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character's emotional struggle at hand. this is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre.

"mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic movies i've ever seen. the name of the film can be translated in english as "the sword-bearer". the main hero (sasha) was born with one exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand. at first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. but it is not about mechenosets. he hardly can be even called the anti-hero. i think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good, justice and love. in his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him (except his mother). every his step is stained with blood; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him. and suddenly he meets her. she doesn't need the idle talks and explanations. she loves him for what he is. she doesn't care what he did. the fact that he's next to her is more important than anything else. but soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her before her very eyes. even after that she couldn't escape her feelings. they try to run but it's hart to hide. finally they have a serious car accident. he is caged; she is in a mental hospital. they don't know anything about each other, but she believes that he'll save her. he surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her. they run again but they aren't invulnerable. she is wounded, she needs a rest, but police almost catch them. he doesn't know what to do, they drive into a corner, and then his sword begins to cut down trees, helicopter around them, but there is no need for it, because she is already dead in his arms, and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.

i watched it subtitled as it was in russian, but really enjoyed it. the main character sasha was born cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things. when sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle. there was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak stomached.not for people who like the regular old hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent films. kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film.

sur mes lèvres or read my lips is fine little thriller that also examines the lives of 'outsiders', people who live in the periphery of our vision who struggle with the need to 'fit in'. director jacques audiard with and co-writer tonino benacquista have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights.carla (emmanuelle devos) is a plain jane, mostly deaf, thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak. enter paul (vincent cassel) a recent released ex-con parolee who responds to an ad to be carla's assistant. there is a mutual physical repulsion at first meeting: carla had hoped for a well-groomed, genteel man who might fulfill her fantasies and paul is a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk. their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla's job by filling her request to steal a letter that would cost her her job and paul discovers carla's lip reading ability which he sees as a way to spy on the criminals from his past who threaten his life for money owed. so this odd couple of a team join forces and together enter a dangerous suspense filled ploy to gain paul's safety and freedom. the relationship is full of twists and edge of the seat suspense with each of these unlikely characters fulfilling roles in their lives that fill the chinks in their walls of isolation in surprising ways.devos and cassel deliver bravura performances and the remainder of the cast is uniformly strong. once again alexandre desplat has produced a musical score that enhances the tension and cinematographer mathieu vadepied finds all the right lighting and angles to suggest the worlds of isolation of the characters as well as the hitchcockian sense of suspense. director audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments. this is a fine film that remains in the ranks of the best of the french film noir genre. recommended. grady harp

carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. she is also deaf.her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. help arrives in the form of paul, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back. the colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price. paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. he formulates a plan which utilises carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. it's now carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.the fourth feature from director jacques audiard, 'read my lips' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. the leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. carla's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. emmanuelle devos, who plays carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.like many french films, 'read my lips' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.it was the french 'new wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and i've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.

i watched this film not expecting much and not knowing anything much about it. i loved it. a very good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that kept things flowing without being hurried. a much, much better film than the same director's de battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and unbelievable.the only thing that didn't quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat: solid, certainly, and far from conventionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it. superb. i wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is. i've seen a bit of gilles' wife and a bit of the moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and i've seen all of de battre mon coeur s'est arreté, and that certainly is rubbish. she seems to have a few coming up, so i'll keep my fingers crossed.

this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters. i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover (let alone reviews) and was intrigued for two solid hours. two lost ships from two different worlds collide. the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact. toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more: our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion. rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty. i'm nitpicking though. after a series of netflix, blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making.

well, what can i say having just watched this fantastic film, when my nerves are still jangling! jacques audiard the director must be making quite a name for himself in france, and rightly so. vince cassel is no tom cruise and emmanuelle devos is no penelope cruz either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a taut and compelling thriller which starts off slowly with some clever character building and then starts to put tension on tension to a wonderful climax. others have written about the plot, so i will not say more than everyone in this film plays their role to perfection, the director, the actors, right down to the cameraman, and everything seems so real, no stupid gun play, the fighting when it happens is so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost as you are there as a spectator. do yourself a favour, get the dvd, a bottle of wine, turn the lights low, take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller :)

a super, unusual film from audiard, read my lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller. it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos. devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean-pierre jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.this is almost the definition of her role as carla, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness. yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in cassel's ex-con paul. each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement. devos/audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.in this film (2001) audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension, action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - a prophet - of nine years later. 7/10

gentleman jim is another case of print the legend, with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in flynn's the charge of the light brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by raoul walsh's vivid direction. flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with alexis smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick alan hale along for good measure, this time as flynn's father (jack carson takes sidekick duties this time). indeed, even the pirate galleon from flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! the 103 minutes just breeze by.

jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. here the idea is treated literally. both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. this discovery may well hold true in france; at any rate, it's quite romantic.

i meant that in a good way, believe me. true to life, it ain't. the whole oirish thing gets kinda thick, but you do enjoy the cast here-flynn, smith, bond, watson, frawley, etc. all good. i also liked seeing mike mazurki-of course he played a boxer, what else? typical forties flick teeming w/ familiar faces and fast paced scenes, one after the other.flynn is fine as gentleman jim, you never get past a 1 dimensional look at him or the rest here, i suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all. the boxing scenes were pretty good, ward bond's vaudeville logging act a riot, and you hadda like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies come racing into the scene a couple of times.really alotta fun, flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why audiences loved him.*** outta ****

errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l. sullivan (ward bond) went around claiming that he "could beat any man alive." both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style, capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. all the warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father, proud of his son's fighting abilities, and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners.all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b&w, although it's too bad warners didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color. he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time, engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out.the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen, with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor.summing up: maintains interest all the way through, whether you're a sports fan or not.

director raoul walsh was like the michael bay of the '40's and years before that. and i mean that in a positive way, since i'm definitely ain't no bay-hater. his movies are just simple high quality entertainment, just like the raoul walsh movies were in his days."gentleman jim" is fine quality entertainment. besides a first class director, it also features a first grade cast, with raoul walsh's regular leading man errol flynn in the main part.what surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen. they used some very dynamic camera-work, which also really made the boxing matches uplifting and exciting to watch, with the end championship fight against john l. sullivan as the ultimate highlight. biopics of the '40's and earlier on were obviously still very much different from biographies being made this present day. modern biographies often glorify its main subject and show his/her life from basically birth till death and everything, mostly emotional aspects, in between. 'old' biopics were just made the same as movies that weren't based on actual real life persons, which also means that the film-makers would often use a use amount of creative liberty with the main character's personality and events that happened in his/her life. this movie is also not just a biography about a boxing legend but also forms a nice portrayal from the period when illegal bare knuckle fighting entered the modern era of boxing.errol flynn does a great job portraying the real life famous boxer james j. corbett aka gentleman jim. not too many people known it but flynn did some real good acting jobs in the '40's, of which this movie is one. fysicaly he also looks in top-shape. he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie. the movie also features some fine supporting actors and some fine acting throughout.a great and entertaining movie that also still truly holds up real well today.8/10

errol flynn is "gentleman jim" in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett, known as the man who beat john l. sullivan. directed with a light hand by flynn's good friend, raoul walsh, the film also stars alexis smith, jack carson, alan hale sr., william frawley and ward bond. flynn plays an ambitious, egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s. though good-natured, the fact that he is a "shanty irishman" and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members; most of them can't wait to see him lose a fight, and they bet against him. despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor. finally he gets the chance he's been waiting for, a match with the world champion, john l. sullivan (ward bond). sullivan demands a $10,000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the $25,000 purse. corbett and his manager (frawley) despair of getting the money. however, help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual.this is a very entertaining film, and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. he has the requisite charm, good looks and athleticism for the role. alexis smith plays victoria ware, his romantic interest who insists that she hates him. in real life, she doesn't seem to have existed; corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895.the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing. corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form. in the film, corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents; it is believed that he wore down john l. sullivan this way.good film to catch flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar.

in late 1800s san francisco, poor well-dressed errol flynn (as james j. corbett) works at a bank, and enjoys attending local "fights" (boxing) with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson (as walter lowrie). one day, pretty alexis smith (as victoria ware) walks into the "comstock bank", where mr. flynn works. flynn is so taken with ms. smith's elegant beauty, he offers to carry her withdrawal purse. smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn, but is put off by his brashness.flynn's good deed (actually, pick-up attempt) gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty "olympic club", which conveniently includes a gymnasium (with boxing equipment). however, flynn's presumptuous manner, and practical joking (he tickles men on the parallel bars) irritates "club" members. when an english boxing champ visits the club, members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man. they are hopeful flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, flynn wins! first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers, and director raoul walsh. mr. buckner was, certainly, basking in the success of his contribution (screenplay) to the studio's brilliant "yankee doodle dandy". unfortunately, this story is positively ludicrous. there was a "gentleman jim" - this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j. corbett's autobiography "the roar of the crowd" - but, this movie must be significantly fictionalized.flynn is a very appealing leading man; he maneuvers the script lightly, and should have been recognized, by the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. many of flynn's characterizations were (are?) overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. smith does well as his feminine interest, deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer. director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant. the supporting cast is a treasure trove, from boisterous alan hale (as pat corbett) to walk-on lon mccallister ("paging mr. corbett").******** gentleman jim (1942) raoul walsh ~ errol flynn, alexis smith, alan hale

excellent warner bros effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performances. it's often cited as his best, and i can't really judge fully until i have seen his "dawn patrol". however, his work in "they died with their boots on" takes some beating. i'm a big flynn fan (he's my favourite actor after james mason--it also helps that he's an aussie) and i think he's just marvellous, a great screen presence and also a great actor. he is the centrepiece of "gentleman jim" as the legendary boxer with the fancy footwork, but he is also backed up by a literate, warm and funny script, and raoul walsh's direction. every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it's pace, he truly was a born film-maker. walsh directs the ring scenes beautifully, as he does with the lighter moments and that poignant, great final scene between ward bord and flynn. add to that great production values (the "gay nineties" never looked better!) and a lovely supporting cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. alan hale usually played flynn's sidekick, but here is his father, and it still all works. alexis smith is flynn's love interest. the pair are head over heels in love with fighting with each other.

just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim. i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol flynn's greatest outings in a career of great outings. i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as. flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life. the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages, transitions, and still inserts that punctuate the film. although the director was raoul walsh, a frequent collaborator with flynn, with cinematographer sid hickox, the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel. i never knew siegel went that far back but he's listed right in the credits. he would go on to a great career as action director himself.

errol flynn's greatest movie, not just a sports movie with a wonder last 5 minutes where ward bond shines. don't miss it just because you think its an old movie. its a classic that could be easily missed. do yourself a favour and don't.

james j. corbett, heavyweight champion of the world from 1892 to 1897, turned out to be errol flynn's favorite role. possibly because he didn't have to wield a sword or be in a western. he grew tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography that he felt he was miscast in westerns and couldn't understand why people liked him in them. it is an enjoyable film, but hardly does tell the real story of james j. corbett.as portrayed corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a man who used brains and speed more than brute strength to win. he defeated john l. sullivan and lost to bob fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. he was also a compulsive womanizer and in that was a lot like the man portraying him. of course that was not shown on the screen. the character that alexis smith plays, the banker's daughter who falls for him, has no basis in reality. corbett was in fact married twice and was flagrantly unfaithful with both of his wives.also though after he lost his title and after the events of this film are concluded he suffered a great personal tragedy. his father in a moment of depression, probably over finances because he lost heavily betting on his son to beat bob fitzsimmons, shot his mother and then turned the gun on himself. the murder/suicide hardly squares with the happy clan that alan hale presided over.one thing though that i did like about gentleman jim. ward bond got the career role of his life in playing john l. sullivan. director raoul walsh got a great performance out of bond as the blustering, but lovable sullivan. even given some of sullivan's bad points that don't make it to the screen like rabid racism, bond's portrayal is the quintessential john l. and the best thing about gentleman jim.speaking of racism, one thing that should have been told was the fact that sullivan while champion refused on grounds of race to meet peter jackson who was black and from australia and probably the best heavyweight of his time. i say probably because as a challenger corbett met him and fought him for 61 rounds to a draw. that fight more than any other created a demand for a sullivan-corbett title match. of course when corbett was champion he refused to give jackson a title shot. maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who may have been better on that particular day.gentleman jim is not jim corbett's story, it is a movie of errol flynn playing at being james j. corbett. but corbett had he been alive in 1942 no doubt would have loved the movie and loved flynn's portrayal of his life. it's as he would have liked to have been remembered.

if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett, then this is probably not the film for you. the famed boxer receives a 1940s "hollywood-ization" of his life--making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life. however, because the performances were so good (particularly by errol flynn) and the script so likable, the film's embellishments can be forgiven.errol flynn plays gay nineties-era boxer james "gentleman jim" corbett--a man who became world boxing champ in 1892. the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l. sullivan. however, while it could have focused mostly on the matches, most are rather brief in the film (except for the final title match) and the emphasis is on corbett's brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith. throughout the film, there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors (such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films, alan hale) and the writing really helped bring these people alive.what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer. while a few of the shots are of doubles, almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist. this was a nice departure for flynn, who generally played "pretty boy" roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was. to find out more about this, try reading a biography of him--he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood.now as for the real james corbett, read on if you aren't afraid of finding out how the movie isn't accurate. first, corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family, but was college educated and bright. second, while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film, they also divorced a few years later. third, the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film, sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened--in reality, sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat-headed guy they portrayed in the film--though it made for a lovely film.

interesting characters, lots of tension. as close to black and white without being black and white. i was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, near deaf secretary, was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues, rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist, and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. i'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. in this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with, or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. too bad, the film could have been great.

this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood. what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history. what makes the story of james j. corbett especially interesting is that mr. corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. in that respect james j. corbett was truly innovated. but getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. alexis smith was beautiful. indeed, she looked like nicole kidman. and although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. ward bond's portrayal of john l. sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective. that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must.

i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "gentleman jim" the best boxing movie ever made. that is the robert wise/paul newman flick "somebody up there likes me." that movie might be number 1, but "gentleman jim" is a close number 2.the movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of james j. corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more "gentlemanly" days of the gloved, marquis of queensbury rules. and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability."gentleman jim" is not a realistic look at those days. it is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. but always delightfully so. errol flynn is perfect as the "gentleman" jim who really isn't a "gentleman" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).at the end of "gentleman jim" the great john l sullivan (whose famous line was not "i can lick any man in the world" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to corbett. this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. realistic? no. but wonderful. hey, if you want realism watch "raging bull" instead. that is a much more realistic boxing movie. but "gentleman jim" is a lot more fun.

loosely based on the james j corbett biography "the roar of the crowd", gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett, but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s.the story follows corbett {a perfectly casted errol flynn} from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico, thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world, john l sullivan {beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond}. not all the fights are in the ring tho, and it's all the spin off vignettes in corbett's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture. there are class issues to overcome here {perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two}, and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers, but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does. along with the quite wonderful corbett family, and all their stoic humorous support, corbett's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous, yet as brash and as bold as he is, he is a very likable character, and it's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim.the film never sags for one moment, and it's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight, the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained, not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture {thank you alexis smith}. the fight sequences stand up really well, and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was, his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history. as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context, and it's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner, and as far as this viewer goes..............it will do for me to be sure to be sure, 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture.

gentleman jim not really a boxing film. it is a vehicle for errol flynn as jim corbett. but having said that, the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener to the modern viewer. there are no 12 round, points decisions here.errol flynn plays the irish bank clerk who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett. his opponent john sullivan is still better however, a bruiser of the old school played by ward bond.the theme of the film is a man pushing for his big chance. corbett leaves his mundane life behind and builds a new persona as gentleman jim. jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. he is a liar and an egotist. sullivan the heavyweight boxing champion is portrayed as a simple brute but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all. and errol flynn gets the girl.

flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. playing real-life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan (bond.) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager. the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. some of it (like the character traits shown by flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) one line is particularly memorable: "i believe you like me more than i like you, but it's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me." it's classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.)

some saying about 'the play is the most important thing', or something like that, is attributed to that old bard of avon, himself, william shakewspeare. if it wasn't old will, it may well have been our own, super-veteran film director, mr. raoul walsh. there are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis. none are more appropriate than gentleman jim(warner brothers, 1942).the film also racks up another award, being named as errol flynn's favourite of his own starring vehicles. it clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the darkened theatre, or viewing it on their home tv or dvd, to conclude same.to be sure, the story is a semi-serious biopic, which takes a portion of factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying, albeit somewhat fictionalized(what biopic isn't?)occurrences.the casting is excellent, as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead, mr. errol flynn. though not a swashbuckler, a western or a war picture, this gentleman jim is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged australian.errol was a member of the australian olympic boxing team in either 1928 or 1932. his training and skills in the 'sweet science'are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the "big fight" for the world's heavyweight boxing championship with the great john l.sullivan,himself.(played in expert fashion by ward bond) the cast reads like a duty roster of warner brothers' resident supporting players. it features alan hale as jim corbet's father, a livery wagon operator*. his two brothers are harry and george (pat flaherty and james flavin), the two 'blue collar' men of the family, their occupations being stated as being 'longshormen'.the great jack carson does his usual masterful serio-comic performance in support as jim corbett's friend and fellow bank teller. the rest of those we can both recognize and remember are:john loder, william frawley,madeleine lebeau, minor watson, rhys williams,arthur shields,dorothy vaughn to name but a few.director walsh also used a number of pro wrestlers in roles of various boxers. hence we have ed "strangler" lewis and an unknown grappler* are featured as the 2 waterfront pugs in the opening scenes. others were sammy stein, mike mazurki(ever hear of him?)and "wee willie" davis. these guys had a powerful,yet unpolished look about them that the old pier 9 brawlers would have possessed.we haven't forgotten leading lady, alexis smith. she is powerful in her characterization of an "independent" woman, yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes. she displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl, victoria lodge.with all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the 'just right' blend. well, director walsh does so with a reckless abandon. because he is looking for, above all, a great film. his treatment shows all of the skills he had honed to a fine tuning starting with his days as a player with d.w. griffith. mr. walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period, the 1890's.*** mr. walsh's direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip, breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch-line, "the corbetts are at it again!" hence, he is able to maintain a light, even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious.furthermore, in an almost unnoticed element, brother walsh gives us an authentic look of a san francisco of the 1890's. and as a further example of his fondness for that period, he creates wide, dynamic images of the historic prize fights. there is a vibrant, joyful mood conveyed in those boxing scenes. as a crowning glory to this great, perhaps underrated film, director walsh gave the image a look as if it were an illustration from the police gazette, which covered such events in those "old days".but there's just one thing to remember before viewing. if it is for the first time, or if your seeing it once more:"the corbets are at it again!!"* in my humble opinion as a historian of both film and pro wrestling, it looks like tor johnson, who years later was a favourite of director ed wood's.** a 'livery' is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle for hire for local city transportation.*** it's true. mr. raoul walsh was a griffith veteran player. he was the actor to portray john wilkes booth in the birth of a nation(1915).**** being born in 1887, raoul walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890's and of the sullivan-corbett championship bout and what it meant to the sporting life in the america of those days.

james j. corbett's autobiography "the roar of the crowd" was the starting point of this lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography. the author was heavyweight champion of the world, succeeding john l. sullivan, before the turn of the century. the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time, when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants, a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone. it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen-time to prove his compeers were wrong. he is an bank teller when the film opens, but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well-to-do. he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl, with whom he always seems to be quarreling, and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others. when he defeats the club's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him, he finally decides to become famous by fighting. he sets out on the road with his friend, who acts as manager and trainer, and despite a few near setbacks, he wins all his bouts and attracts attention. coming home to pursue his girl again, he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy, mighty john l. sullivan, who enters bars and claims he can "lick any man in the world". few believe he can win a bout against sullivan, but corbett, dubbed "gentleman jim" for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving, dancing out of range, and negating the furious sullivan's power. the film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett. the new champion rises to the moment, tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different, and shows him nothing but admiration and respect. he gets his girl as a result of his two performances, but by the end of the film, as they visit his s parents, his manager is able to tell the world, "the corbetts are at it again". the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy. the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel. sidney hickox did the cinematography, with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith. heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns. the film was ably directed by action-film specialist raoul walsh. flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often, michael curtiz. among the cast,were ward bond as john l. sullivan, in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett, a young man he seemed to relish playing--he later said it was his favorite role from the period...jack carson was his manager, alan hale his charismatic father, john loder a rich foe, with william frawley, minor watson, madeleine lebeau, rhys williams, arthur shields, dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings. it is hard to say enough about the logic and light-hearted fun this movie's makers have generated; it is one of the best-liked of all sports biography films, and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well.

this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn. while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' european terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. the supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their roles.the story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. from what i know of jim corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful to history. i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco. all in all, there's little not to like about this film...very well worth the time to watch it.

well, i am delighted to hear a rumor that this may finally be issued on dvd. when that will happen, i don't know, but i will grab it when it's released.in my humble opinion, this is errol flynn's most entertaining film, especially when "gentleman jim" corbett's ring career begins in the film. then it goes from a good film to a great one.few people could play arrogant men and still come off as a likable good guy as well as flynn could and this film is a perfect example of that. reportedly, this was flynn's favorite role and i believe that. you can just sense how much fun he was having here. ward bond also looks like he was really enjoying his role playing the famous john l. sullivan. bond, too, was never better.there is just the right amount of action boxing scenes in here and they are pretty well done, too. corbett's family is fun to watch, too, as they carry on in the stands during jim's matches. out of the arena, corbett's family's constant arguments and yelling can get a little too loud and annoying but they set the stage for a fitting conclusion.and speaking of the conclusion, sullivan's speech to corbett after the big fight is very touching and the highlight of the film. some mean-spirited critics (variety, for example) didn't like that ending nor the fact that much of the film is fictionalized but - duh - most films are fictionalized, like it or not. and, in this case, it made for a nice story and nice ending. (in real life, corbett was a very soft-spoken true gentleman, not anything like flynn's portrayal, but flynn still make him a good guy.)this is one of the more entertaining classic films i have ever watched and i eagerly wait for the dvd.

after erasing my thoughts nearly twenty-seven times, there is a feeling that i can now conquer this review for the complex french drama, "read my lips". having written over five hundred reviews, i have never found myself at such a loss of words as i did with director jacques audiard's subtle, yet inspirational love story. thought was poured over what was loved and hated about this film, and while the "loves" overpowered, it was the elements that were hated that sparked further debate within my mind. "read my lips" is a drama. to be more precise, is a character driven drama which fuses social uncertainty with crime lords with the doldrums of everyday office work. here is where this review begins to crumble, it is all of these items  but it is moremuch, much more. as a viewer, you are pulled in instantly by emmanuelle devos' portrayal of this fragile woman named carla, whose strength is lost to the males in her office as well as her hearing difficulty. audiard introduces us harshly to her world by removing sound from the screen whenever she is not wearing her aid, causing an immediate unrest, not only from the characters within the film, but to those watching. without sound, the world is left open to any possibility, and that is frightening.as we watch this difficult and unsettling woman setting into her life, we are then uprooted and given the opportunity to meet paul (played exquisitely by vincent cassel), a slicked-back hair, mustache-wearing lanky man who was just released from prison, homeless, jobless, and forced by his parole officer to get a job. this is how carla and paul meet. there is that moment of instant, unsettling attraction. the one where we think she loves him, but he is dark (and here is where it gets even more fun)  and where we think he loves her, but she is dark. the constant role reversal creates the tone of the unknown. who, as viewers, are we to feel the most sympathy for? paul sleeps in the office, carla helps him; carla looses a contract to a rival co-worker, paul helps her; carla's ability to read people's lips comes in handy for a make-shift idea for paul. the continual jumps back and forth keep you on your chair, waiting for the possibility of some light to shine through this dark cave. it never does. audiard cannot just allow this story to take place, he continually introduces us to more characters; one just as seedy as the next. even our rock, our solid foundation with the parole officer is in question when his wife goes missing  a subplot to this film that at first angered me, but upon further debate was a staple finale for this film. yet none of this could have happened if it weren't for our characters. devos' solemn and homely look is breathtaking, as she changes her image for paul; the truth of her beauty is discovered. paul, the wildcard in the film, continues to seemingly use and abuse the friendship for his final endgame. then, just as we assume one, carla takes on one last shape.audiard knows he has amazing actors capturing his characters. cassel and devos could just play cards the entire time and i would still be sitting at the end of my chair. the story, probably the weakest part of this film, is at first random. the interwoven stories seem unconnected at first, but audiard lets them connect bit by bit. again, the entire parole officer segment was tangent, but that final scene just solidified the ends to the means. not attempting to sound vague, but this complex (yet utterly simple) story is difficult to explain. there is plenty happening, but it is up to you to connect the pieces. a favorite scene is when carla is attempting to discover where some money is being held. that use of sound and scene was brilliant. it was tense, it was dramatic, and it was like watching a who-dun-it mystery unfold before your eyes.overall, i initially though this was a mediocre french film that i could easily forget about when it was over  i was proved wrong. "read my lips" opens the floor for discussion, not just with the characters, but the situations. one will find themselves rooting for carla in one scene, and paul in the next. when a discovery is made in paul's apartment by carla, i found myself deeply angry. audiard brought true emotion to the screen with his characters and development, and what he was lacking in plot  the actors were able to carry. i can easily suggest this film to anyone, but be prepared; this isn't a one time viewing film. repeat. repeat. repeat.grade: **** out of *****

probably the best film of the year for me. this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla (emmanuelle devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips. a change is set in motion when she hires newly paroled con paul (vincent cassel) as her assistant. the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film. mutual dependency, for vastly different reasons, bonds them. carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for,what seems like,the first time. paul does nothing to dispel her feelings because he needs her help. he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve carlas' skill of reading lips. i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense/drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars. throughout the whole film, no matter what other characters are on screen, you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul. i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors. emmanuell devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the french cesar for best actress). you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting, this really is carla. the chameleon like vincent cassel is also wonderful. he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive. i loved this film because of these two people, and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again.

"read my lips" tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (casel). as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation. (b+)

i picked this one up on a whim from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. lots of tight, expressionistic camera work, an equally tight script, and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film. not for the reptilian multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of cinema. if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it, i'm sure it will ruin it. a choice treat all the way around. other posters here have more than amply sung its praises, so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans; just take their advice, and mine, and don't miss this gem. call it what you like; i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent. read my lips: don't miss it.

i settled back to watch "read my lips," a plate of freedom fries before me. the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co-writer jacques audiard's original and superb thriller.carla (emmanuelle devos) is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects. she actually has some significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she's capable and ambitious. and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her.work piling up faster than she can handle it, carla is told to hire a secretary. enter ex-con and general layabout paul (vincent cassel). he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require. after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla's interest in him, the two become allies. a quirky friendship starts. in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on "the apprentice," she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul's connivance. exit the rival.carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. with it she hears almost normally. she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people. she's also very lonely. a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful. she hasn't a boyfriend. she babysits so a friend can have a liaison (it is a french movie) worse and humiliatingly, she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla's bed. not nice.as carla and paul get to know each other better, the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges. there's a side story, by the way, of paul's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending."read my lips?" ingenious paul recognizes that carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be.from there a caper develops. enough said.paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple. she wants love but will also accept money. he wants her, sort of, but business must come before possible erotic satiation. together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly.rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for "read my lips." and you may well want to watch it several times: i do.9/10

re: pro juryalthough the lead actress is strikingly beautiful, the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know, but i doubt it."easily give away virginity"? what a shrewd remark about this film. truly.one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, more often than not, teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.you just aren't at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes? that's sad.one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake, but i think not. and another "expert" opinion drawn from experience. dandy.one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into, and hang around inside, a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble, but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up.one final nit, throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome. there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene.of course there's probably an explanation. good job figuring that out! now i'll be generous and will help you out of your misery: although it was translated as a general "foursome", the word "&#269;etvorka" has another meaning: it's a sports term used to designate a 4m or 4w setup - a rowing crew consisting of 5 persons: 4 rowers and a coxswain.this movie did not ring true for me.we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion. dude.

"hey babu riba" is a film about a young woman, mariana (nicknamed "esther" after a famous american movie star), and four young men, glenn, sacha, kicha, and pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 belgrade, yugoslavia. the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything american it seems.the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. in the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).i enjoyed the film with some reservations. the subtitles for one thing were difficult. especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. perhaps the conversational pace required it, but i couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. i watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. there is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.i would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, jovan acin (1941-1991).

i was intrigued by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity...), i stayed up and watched it. i then checked my tv listings and watched it again! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are virtually the same. the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to, let's say, somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period, and language differences aside, would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era. they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music... as a matter of fact, much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970's southern california.this was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. the characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable also. i won't say this was the yugoslav "american graffiti", but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's-themed movies.

a very well made film set in early '60s communist yugoslavia. the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. a clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. highly recommended.

a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is. the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. it isn't supposed to but it does. this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer. it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema. obviously, 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed. one can listen to rock and roll music, one of the songs played is the song "hey babu riba" ala the title of the movie. but jeans cannot be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess. unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four. the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him, the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys, the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it. the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands. these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away, as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire. a great movie worth seeing again and again. "repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody's friend."

one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex yu.story is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same way.people in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people.the plot is in the 50",when josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence.but,in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything.the friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from yu is still alive.they get together after all this years on ester"s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood,before their went to the emigration and become successful people.

my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many (american) reviewers tend to do. this is not about growing up on main street, usa. it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west. just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else, and esther is torn between the "tovarish joe" and the guys. there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito. i feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director. movies like this make freedom feel more important. it is not just "another eastern european coming of age film"...it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom.

if you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to, here is your answer -they just don't make 'em in hollywood anymore. we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be. read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard, featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent cassel.the basic plot could have been written in the 40's: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing, manipulate each other to meet their own ends, develop complex love/hate relationship, cook up criminal scheme involving heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money. all action takes place in depressing, seedy and/or poorly lit locations. audiard has fashioned some modern twists, of course. the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her. and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature. add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film, but make no mistake - this is old school film noir. it's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i've seen all year.

i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it. the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie. i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself, but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time. in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers, but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie. normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income. but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman. that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did."sur mes lèvres" or "read my lips" as it is called in english, tells the story of a young secretary named carla. she is a hardworking and loyal employee, but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues. that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency, which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company. but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her, all this is about to change. paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict. the man is a thief, but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed. she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like, but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life...since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard's directing. fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie. i hadn't heard of him before, but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end. that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course. i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role, instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband (you know, the typical tv-movie story).also worth noticing is the acting in this movie. vincent cassel is quite famous, but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me. there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles, but they both did an excellent job with their characters, making them feel very believable and realistic. paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting. despite the fact that i had my doubts about it, i've soon become one of its greatest admirers. i give this movie an 8/10. don't hesitate to give it a try.

this was one of the dvd's i recently bought in a set of six called "frenchfilm" to brush up our french before our planned holiday in beautiful provence this year. so far, as well as improving our french we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of french cinema.what a breath of fresh air to the stale, predictable, unimaginative, crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by hollywood. what a good example for screenplay writers, actors, directors and cinematographers to follow. it was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures. the other thing i liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end. is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display? will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her? the viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other.once you have seen this film, like me you may want to see it again. i still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look. the plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office. you must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place. but if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of french cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied. four stars out of five for me.

i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched. it has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. singleton shows how life in university can be. there are 3 main story lines, the skinheads, the african-americans, and the homosexuals. i was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl. the end was great. after seeing the movie 25 times plus, i still cry. i would have given this movie an 11, but i have to settlefor 10/10.

in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot. it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships. this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for. in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap. definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.

french film directors continue to amaze with their extraordinary ability to simulate the sights and sounds of ordinary, everyday suburban life. this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of l'emploi du temps ( time out ) , a brilliant character study of of a white collar worker's descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job. as is the penchant of french filmmakers , many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places, giving a cinema verite feel to the story , yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage ( most notably a swiss mountain retreat ). running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production, jacques audiard's gritty crime caper, sur mes levres ( read my lips ). actually, to tag this film a crime caper does it a disservice because it is so much more than that. as with the earlier french release, it is an incisive character study of marginal people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them. in a paris construction firm carla, a shy, diminutive young woman sits at her desk, sequestered to an area of the office that is a major pathway to the xerox machines and restrooms.obnoxious coworkers use the front of carla's desk to chat and drop off their half-finished styrofoam cups of coffee. partially deaf, carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes bothersome, be it the drone of the paper copiers or the shrill crying of a friend's baby. when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a secretarial assistant to help her with the work load, carla fears she may lose her job. at the employment office carla lists the specifications she wants for her assistant (preferably male) as if she were at a personals agency. he should be 25 years old and clean -cut , with extensive computer and filing skills. when the agency sends over an unkempt , menacing looking young man, carla is both shocked and intrigued. they leave the office and have lunch at a local eatery, where carla interviews her prospective assistant. when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison , carla initially wants nothing to do with paul, but has a change of heart and hires him on. although she is basically kind toward her helper, carla now finds herself in a position of authority and possessing a newfound sense of power. paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker. carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his parole officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his appointment. during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing deficiency and reveals her ability to read lips. later, when an avaricious coworker blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on, a furious carla asks paul's help in seeking revenge on the man. from here on in sur mes levres becomes an increasingly intense crime drama escalating into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years. the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock, most notably rear window, where carla's lip-reading talent comes into full play using a pair of binoculars. there is a teasing, on-again, off-again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that culminates in a rather strange homage to north by northwest, but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars. that being said, what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers, although those elements are definitely there, but the pervasive view a of a modern day city (in this case paris) where life runs the gamut from mundane workdays to a boozy, garish nightlife where sex, drugs and laundered money infiltrate the lives of several characters. unlike hollywood productions, this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street, where a punch in the face or groin sounds like a sickening thud and where the office is a place to be feared. it's hitchcock with the gloves off.

when john singleton is on, he's *on*!! and this is one of his better films. not quite as tight as boyz-n-the-hood, but close to it (and with much of the same stellar cast). this film was very well written, very well put together, and very well shot. there's very little to criticize, and most of my complaints are superficial (eg: where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff? no mention of a rich background... and why doesn't professor phibbs have an office? a professor of his stature *should* have one... and while we're at it, for an engineering student, hick or not, remy's a pretty dumb character - i'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon).but that aside, the film was very sharp. a good array of characters and points of view; and singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic, and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides.much of the cinematography was excellent; i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well. also the malik/deja scenes were really well shot as well.the dialogue was a bit much at times; this film had a tendency to get *really* preachy at times, and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness (we really didn't need the us flag with 'unlearn' typed onto it, give some credit, we're not morons...). and to top it off, although *most* of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well, sometimes it gets *way* too cheezy (like deja's death, which is fine until she screams out 'why!!!' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene).but the acting, in general, was top of the line. fabulous performances by omar epps (perhaps the best i've ever seen), kirsty swanson (who knew buffy could act??), michael rapaport (surprised the hell out of me...after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one-role actor), and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are *always* outstanding.downside? jennifer connelly was flat; though it's not completely her fault: her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional. generic to the highest degree. and tyra banks, who had the role, was nothing short of horrid. she whined and whined and whined. yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably (though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule).finally, the soundtrack! wow! an amazing soundtrack (which is definitely worth buying!) which fits the film like a glove. each scene has a twin song (although the tori amos songs started to *really* annoy me by the end...not her best work). liz phair, rage against the machine, ice cube...how can one go wrong??all in all: a really good watch, a really strong cast, great script, great film. 8/10.

this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues. it dealt with issues of rascism and class. but, it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. what others think of you is not important. i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully. i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is, but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie.

this is the first movie i've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director. the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them. omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work. he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks. kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly, who is a lesbian, and isn't sure about which way to go. michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo-nazis and their leader is cole hauser. those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them. it's a great film and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie.

this movie came and went in the theaters. due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received. it was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself. higher learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in america: racism.plot/story: higher learning is mostly centered around malik(played by omar epps), a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough, and a stern professor(played by laurence fishburne). he befriends fudge(ice cube) as well as a gorgeous lady named deja(tyra banks). later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus. remy(play by michael rapaport) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus. once they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are.opinion: higher learning is not without its flaws: character development is scarce, okay performances by omar epps, tyra banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name i forgot), busta rhymes doesn't fit in this movie at all. plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché' before this film so you know i didn't like that part of the film with kristy swanson. other than that, this movie wasn't half bad. laurence fishburne was good as professor phipps(even though i could do without the accent), fudge was ice cube's best performance and michael rapaport was good as the confused remy. all in all it was one of john singleton's best movies and is one is one of the reasons i frown on the rubbish he puts out now. cinema needs more movies like higher learning, mississippi burning and american history x and less movies like baby boy, 2 fast 2 furious and a very pointless remake of shaft.

higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background. it's a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we have to be able embrace and understand diversity.some have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is, ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our society.everyone involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher learning.sure it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps.

i enjoyed this movie very much. kristy swanson omar epps, and ice cube were all great in it. the movie dealt with many issues, and i didn't know if i was going to like it, but singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about.

omar epps is an outstanding actor. i really think he gets into his character alot. when deja gets shot he shows true emotion. he also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. omar is a very talented actor!!

this story was probably one of the most powerful i have ever taken in. john singleton certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece. brilliant performances by the whole cast, but epps and rapaport turned in the best and most convincing of either young star's career.however, as a college student myself, many of the issues that singleton touched on were taken to the extreme. in a sense that, while they are issues faced on many college campuses, they aren't presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe. in some instances, it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur. however, aside from the fact that it was a little over dramatic, the film was brilliant and left me stunned, unable to talk, just think. one of the things from this picture i will remember forever, was a quote from lawrence fishburn's character, "knowledge is power, without knowledge, you cannot see your power." brilliant, just brilliant.

this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues. it's full of emotion and the direction is done well. the storyline progresses very quickly, but i guess that's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie. this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy.

*** spoilers *** this movie always seems very exaggerated, until i remember that my college campus had a former-student-turned-nazi-racist-killer-who-then-committed-suicide, too: his name was benjamin nathaniel smith.look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him.it's hard to believe, but this stuff really does happen.i'm not a big fan of omar epps or ice cube, but larry fishburne, kristy swanson, jennifer connelly & mike rappaport were good.

one of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews. the movie starts out well enough, with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier (which is rarer than you'd think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequences passable (for a kung fu movie, this is a great compliment). unlike other chinese action movies, which were always period pieces or (in the wake of jackie chan's police story i) cop dramas, pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china. unfortunately, in the latter 1/3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary.the action is overall good, featuring a duel between sammo and 1/2 of the shaw brothers' only 2 stars, kar-leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy. there's only 20 minutes of combat here, which is standard, but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames. i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other, but there are smooth edits and then there's this. it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with.that said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion here won't dissuade you, and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this.

of life in (some) colleges. of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges.i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own. it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. and i can honestly say, that it's there. but the thing is when class lets out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity. is that bad? not really. everyone needs a feeling of belonging. but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that, "we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them." otherwise you're creating your own segregation.racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended. one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen.so is "higher learning" overly dramatic? exaggerated? maybe. is it way "off mark?" it depends on where you went to or go to school. the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen. minus the hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.

first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in. 1995. rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it.remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by nazis. they took him in. nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. michael rappaport played the part perfectly.omar epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. she then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically.this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play.i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (nazis). so what? remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. he was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. he even says right before he kills himself, i didn't mean it, i wanted to be an engineer.ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men, ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness. sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the nazis? no.people say it shows white=-bad black=good. not true, the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even remy was a good guy, he was just misguided.omar epps, ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well.good movie, well done. like all movies that deal with racism, its a great piece to get a discussion going.i don't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though.

john singleton's finest film, before blockbuster wannabees like the shaft remake, this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the stories 3 main characters, each with identifiable youngster problems.what i liked about it most is that it also covers the problem of selfpity among young blacks, a problem mostly ignored by the media and other films who mostly focus on social-economical problems and racism by whites. this movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist.the masterful thing about this film is that it deals with so many topics without getting shallow. it's not just about racism, but about how hard it can be to adopt to a new world (college), date rape, discovering sexuality and isolation. omar epps, michael rapaport and kristy swanson each deliver fine performances, and the supporting cast is equally interesting with jennifer connelly as a lez (yay) and with ice cube and busta rhymes as college bums causing little riots.the only negative is the caricature of a professor by laurence fishburne ("peppermint?"). surely, plenty of professors are nutty. but they're not as flat. the skinheads are also a bit of a caricature, but i guess they are like that too in real life.overall a great underrated piece of filmwork, if you liked american history x you'll love this one.8,5 out of 10

the film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (u.s.). we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. it did not attempt to show how either was right, although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). the film also discusses sex and rape. it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps. he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. other stars that make this film are omar epps, ice cube, and jennifer connelly. michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. in fact, i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. it is a life-learning process, not a textual one. i think you'll find "higher learning" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10

this is one of the best hong kong (action) films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes. this sammo film has it all, romance, drama, excitement and a great hero as well. it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights. sammo fans- this is a must see (see also eastern condors, shanghai express (yuen biao is ace!), dragons forever and enter the fat dragon.

this is one excellent sammo hung movie. actually, this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema. the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up w/ a vicious pimp. the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined. the story is involving and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes. sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business. the action is simply amazing, esp. the fight w/ lau kar leung and the finale. billy chow and sammo hung are amazing. a must see for any fan of action.

what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said. this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed!! there are moments of genius throughout this movie, if you can, see it now! thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago!

sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos.this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat. sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in.some great and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted.the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the best end fights i've seen. sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow.

sammo hung's 1989 film pedicab driver is considered by many to be his masterpiece. i have to agree to some extent as the film in its greatest parts really gets as incredible and fantastic as any hong kong film ever has. it is a combination of pretty good and well written drama, interesting and sympathetic (and also non-sympathetic) characters, some genuinely funny humor and truly over-the-top hyper kung fu that is guaranteed to make many jaws drop when someone not familiar with hong kong cinema watches the film as well as it does to the experienced enthusiasts of the unique industry.sammo and max mok siu chung play two pedicab drivers who live in hong kong in the middle part of the last century, i think. they drive their cabs and are also desperate for love. sammo is interested in local baker girl ping (nina li chi) while max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful fennie yuen kit-ying he falls madly in love with. many other characters get introduced, too, and they remain pretty clear all the time if the viewer really concentrates on the film and its plot so i cannot say the film is confusing as it could be much worse especially in hong kong! soon we get to know, for instance, that a ruthless gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent acts affect our protagonists, too, and so the premise for some of the most incredibly choreographed kung fu fight sequences has been created. as well as some nice drama.the film has a great cast. the leads are all very good and restrained (not as painfully awful over-acting and "humor" as in sammo's otherwise great eastern condors (1987), for example) and they are also, thanks to the carefully written screenplay, pretty likable and easy to identify with. the cast includes many familiar hk cinema faces and directors in small roles like corey yuen kwai (the legendary action director and director of films like saviour of the soul 1 and 2, ninja in the dragon's den and fong sai yuk 1 and 2), the masterful composer lowell lo koon-ting (john woo's the killer and ringo lam's school on fire and prison on fire among many others, pedicab driver included!), the shaw veteran liu chia liang (whom with sammo has a furious fight with sticks), alfred cheung kin-ting (the director of dark hk noir classic on the run from 1988), the late great lam ching ying (best known for his friendly face in various hk vampire horror/kung fu/comedies) to name just a few. in fact, the cast in pedicab driver is one of the most interesting i've seen in any other hk production.the film has some interesting peaceful moments most notably about the love affair between max mok and fennie yuen and one crisis they confront thanks to lowell lo's character. they really could have done this a completely serious piece if they had wanted as the discussions about human values and meaning of love, no matter what's your past or what you've done for living, get so serious and genuinely effective at the middle part that the film immediately gets much more noteworthy than our average kung fu spectacle actioner. also the other characters' efforts to cure things is very touching and tells delightfully much about right human relations and friendship, and of course love. still i think what fennie says to max (about the future "bad cooking") is very unnecessary and tones the potential of the whole segment and its themes down pretty effectively, unfortunately.but then we get to the thing the film makers were interested the most in. which is the action, the outrageous and over-the-top action. the fight scenes include traditional kung fu, some sticks, meat cleavers and the like and they're used here as hysterically as in the most mind blowing kung fu scene i've seen in any film ever, jackie chan's drunken master ii (1994), they really are that great! there are wires and they're used very cleverly and people literally fly to the opposite corner of the room when they get kicked or punched. simply amazing and again something only hong kong cinema can deliver. also the dangerous stunts make the viewer hold his/her breath as the film has one fast car vs. pedicab chase sequence and various dangerous looking jumps and twisting bodies flying through the air and crushing with force to the hard destination. still the film makers seem not to "accept" the violence of the film as sammo is, like the late bruce lee, willing to give himself up after the final murderous mayhem at the gangster villa, and i think this kind of morale, no matter how obvious or shallow it may be, is a good thing even in a harmless film like this, as cinema is meant to be much more than just brainless entertainment.the film has also some very witty bits of humor that i'm not sure everyone in hollywood or america (for example) would understand or like at all. the hilarious star wars gag at the beginning is definitely among these and it literally forced me to laugh when i realized what i was seeing. also some funny scenes are created out of sammo's passion for ping. still, the greatest amazement-filled laugh came during the scenes depicted in the former pharagraph as the imagery of big and tall men flying with great force over the screen to the walls or furniture is simply insane and so breathtaking i just cannot hide my feelings and thoughts about these eastern film makers when i witness something like this, and this is nothing but positive and appreciating reaction, of course.pedicab driver is among the most incredible hong kong action films that i have ever seen and easily among sammo's greatest achievements. if the few minor flaws were not there, this could rate even brighter and higher. 8/10

this, "prodigal son" and "eastern condors" are my favourite sammo hung films. the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in "condors", but he's no less sure-footed as director or actor. he is, in fact, at the top of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story also. love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.the opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone. a sequence in which sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, comic tone. the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its type. the film's violence escalates slowly until, finally, when the climactic showdown comes, we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production. the director/actor's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry, menacing opponents is a bone-cracking, physically punishing delight.terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made.great score, too.

a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak. she was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. i think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. we can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. the scene where she stares at him across the cat's head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. it's a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building, and we see the age difference very sharply. as he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee.

the 1960's tv series bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. this is the movie that jimmy stewart & kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock. this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as captivating.this was jack lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs. the movie has a lot of good things about it. hermine gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in the music man. the cast is very solid.this movie has a late 1950's new york city feel & a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie. it is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & a little magic too boot.it is not vertigo but i think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that william asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. i am not so glad about what will ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.

bell book and candle was released in december 1958 and features james stewart, kim novak, jack lemmon. and ernie kovaks. this film had james stewart and kim novak in their second on-screen pairing (after the alfred hitchcock classic vertigo, released earlier the same year). this was stewart's last film as a romantic lead as he was deemed too old at age 50 to play that sort of part anymore. the movie is about a witch played by kim novak who is attracted to a mortal played by james stewart. she puts a spell on him and he falls head over heels in love with her. i enjoyed the movie and its cast. this movie at the time was a moderate success which was nominated for a golden globe for best movie comedy. gimmeclassics

this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story. the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series "bewitched," this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. the comparisons are obvious. jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid "straight." kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell. but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch, she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket (her feline familiar) is being cared for by her beloved aunt. you'll recognize the aunt from "murder by death." this movie is fun and touchingly sweet, bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel. worth a look.

this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man, in a mortal world. her "community" is open among it's members, but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals. hmmmm...this is starting to sound familiar. lol. it's not your typical movie. very "campy" performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull. kim novak is always a pleasure on screen, but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual (but not fatal to the story).with re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark, this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences...... it's still a hoot !

kim novak's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover, and james stewart's her choice. scintillating comedy of manners, from the broadway stage; shot by james wong howe in witch color, and performed by a sterling cast. ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch. i love this movie, though few others seem to. kim alone makes it a winner in my book. ha! my #5 film of 1958.

this is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star sandra bullock and hugh grant; actually, now that i think about it, this one is quite liable to be remade one day. it's pleasant, but with no depth whatsoever. it suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of james stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful kim novak. ernie kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call "wit". (**1/2)

vertigo co-stars stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and novak elevate this, stewart's other "christmas movie," movie to above mid-level entertainment. the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people's relationships. all in all, a nice diversion with legendary stars, 7/10.

for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart, this is one of his "lesser" films from later in his career. and, while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures, it isn't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more.kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her. over time, the cold and detached ms. novak also begins to fall in love with stewart--and apparently in the witch's rule book, this is a definite no, no!! the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches. they are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety. most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps). and, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. considering what i think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world!anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something i would rush out to watch. the acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact, i almost scored the film a 6--it was really close.

it's a gentle, easy-going 1950s comedy. kim novak belongs to a coven of witches in manhattan. she puts a spell on neighbor jimmy stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him, losing her powers. see, witches are permitted to have "hot blood" but not love. elsa lanchester is novak's aunt, also a witch. jack lemmon is her brother, ditto. hermione gingold is the chief witch, and ernie kovacks is sidney redlich, an author who specializes in writing about witches.i described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else. everything is so smooth and polished, from the set decoration, through wardrobe and plot, to the performances and direction. take the character of ernie kovacks. he's referred to as "a drunk and a nut." and here's how the movie demonstrates these traits. he asks for a second drink, and, though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen, his hair is a bit long and tousled. that's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut. nothing is out of place; everything is tidy and free of dust. the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely scuffed.and the zodiac club, where the witches hang out. it's called "a low dive." yet it's a clean, dark place with polite waiters, a quintet of musicians, neatly dressed clientèle, and potted plants against bare brick walls. that is not my idea or yours of a "low dive" -- not even for greenwich village in 1958. my idea of a dive in greenwich village is julius's or the white horse tavern or the san remo or the swing rendezvous, a now defunct lesbian hangout. the zodiac club is a high dive compared to these.the kookiness we always hear about is muted by today's standards. i mean, kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet. and she wears a lot of black clothes like the beatniks of the period did.but never mind all that. it's an enjoyable romantic comedy. kim novak is effective as gillian, who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden. she has a strange beauty, bulky and ethereal at the same time. she glides rather than walks, a wispy presence. her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic french curves. and jimmy stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim. in the 1930s he usually played in light roles. in the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist, but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use. who could resist laughing when hermione gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of novak's spell? it's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming. richard quine directs the movie quietly, without fireworks or special effects, and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had. note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart, when the siamese cat's face and ears seem to merge with novak's startling eyes.ernie kovacks in the 1950s was a well-known television personality. there was never anything quite like the ernie kovacks show before -- or after. it brings the word "surrealism" to mind. he could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only bartok's concerto for orchestra as background. and he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of percy dovetail, an effete poet. the credits kind of skip over the condoli brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys -- pete and conte -- were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles. conte was later a member of doc severison's band on johnny carson's late show.the third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more "romantic" than "comedy". but it's never dull. the whole film rolls along as neatly as van druten's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too.

gillian holroyd (kim novak) is a witch. secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson (james stewart). she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. she decides to tell him her secret. but how will shep react when he finds out that he was "tricked" into falling in love with gillian? as far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, bell book and candle is good, but nothing spectacular. it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. the movie's cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. the supporting cast with jack lemmon, hermione gingold, and elsa lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart. the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. is it a screwball comedy? is it a romantic comedy? is it a supernatural comedy? had director richard quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.

i can watch b,b&c and feel all the emotions i felt when i first saw it at aged 18 well,maybe all but one.certainly miss k.novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century.she was a thinking youth's diana dors.all those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching,collar - tightening,blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good. now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the video shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal. this movie is miss novak's golden moment.she seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence. she completely dominates the amiable mr j.stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie.misses e.lanchester and h.gingold offer comic relief along with mr e. kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed.mr j.lemmon plays miss novak's brother.he is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream.some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later.certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and mr lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one. but all else is mere frippery,miss novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for "bell,book and candle".it survives,its reputation enhanced,as the ultimate showcase for one of hollywood's most beautiful women. loved by moviegoers,ignored by critics,miss novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the "play" buttons on their dvds.one day,probably after we are all gone,she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time.

john van druten's "bell, book and candle" is a delightful and unexpected fantasy about a coven of modern-day witches living in new york city; it was obviously an attractive movie property. it had a stellar part for gillian holroyd, for her erstwhile book publisher enforced-sweetheart, shepherd henderson and her madcap family and circle, including shep's bewildered fiancée, the hateful merle kittredge, against whose chances with shep gillian begins her magical spell-casting. it even had pyewacket, a siamese cat-familiar with well-timed miaows, sidney redlitch, a fake witch expert with atrocious pretensions and bad manners. in short, it seemed to its producer, perhaps, box-office magic. and so it proved to be. so many things were right about its production, it only had one element not perfect; but i found the rest to be amusing, charming and very consistently-entertaining. to begin with, the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best qualities of the fine theatrical play but opened out its scenes to include greenwich village and other areas of new york's scene. the technical production was beautiful, with cinematography by the legendary james wong howe, a fine score by george duning, more-than-clever sets by louis diage and gowns by jean louis. in the attractive cast were wolfe barzell, howard mcnear, janice rule as merle, ernie kovacs as redlitch, jack lemmon as gillia's mischievous brother, wonderful comediennes elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witches and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching parts as gillian. jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment; he did well with the comedic portions of his part, but he was never convincing as a new york book publisher, and a bit too-old for the part of henderson anyhow. but director richard quine used subtle lighting, pace changes, and unusually-composed shots to indicate the oddness of the witch portions of the film, keeping the other portions very luminous but straightforward in their presentation. the plot's main crisis in the film comes to pass when in reality gillian falls for henderson, who does not believe in witches at all. she started out merely to alienate him from his fiancée, her stuck-up college rival. later, when henderson tries to walk out, he keeps coming back to her--and realizes he is under a spell, as she has apologetically tried to explain to him. ..meanwhile, sidney redlich has been summoned by witching spell to come to new york to sell his book to henderson. of course he knows nothing at all of magic, but is quite puzzled and interested to find out why he had come anywhere at all; but gillian's brother enlightens him. all comes out right in the end in this romantic satire as gillian proves her love to henderson by losing her powers--which is what happens to witches when they truly love a mortal. of course, he never really wanted to resist her anyhow. the film has sprightly dialogue, charm, and a little "magic" of its own in the fey charm of the witches and the torments gillian must undergo in her battle with herself, and to win the man she loves. a lovely ending to this beautifully-photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism, though a fantasy, just about complete in my view. memorably delightful.

"bell book and candle" was shown recently on cable. not having seen it for a while, we decided to take another look at this comedy. based on the james van druten's broadway hit, which was a vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties, the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash. the film was directed by richard quine, who turned the play into a delightful comedy.evidently, judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb, the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars, who had collaborated on "vertigo", released the same year. movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released. in fact, most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women.the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers. kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing. as the witch that becomes human, her gillian is charming. james stewart, who plays the publisher shep' henderson, is also seen at his best. mr. stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top.in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester, playing queenie, is a welcome addition to any movie, as she proves here. jack lemmon's nicky holroyd, the brother of gillian, is also good. ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch.this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching "bell book and candle".

i watched this movie after watching practical magic, and the older film was far superior. i liked the way the lighting, makeup, and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story. jimmy stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film, but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian's character. i was also struck by nicky's and gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine. the gestures nicky makes when he's showing redlich his powers especially struck me. i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate, so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters.

have not seen this 1958 film in a very long time and greatly enjoyed kim novak playing the role as gil holroyd who is an actual witch and has an aunt named queenie holroyd who is also a witch and gillian also has a brother warlock named nick played by jack lemmon. when gillian sets her eyes on shep henderson,(james stewart) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry; gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with gillian. the story tells that a real witch cannot fall in love, blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between shep and gillian, so nick and aunt queenie decided they have to do something about this situation. great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958.

after you see vertigo, then watch bell, book and candle, made within months of each other.my second favorite kim novak film, with picnic, coming in as third.all three performances are great, vertigo, being the best, of all.they came to my nowhere kansas prairie town, near by, at salina, kansas in the 50s, to film, picnic. bell, book and candle's musical score, i believe is one of alex north's. perfect for this bit of comedy.after vertigo, stewart and novak, did this comedy, how amusing to note the dramatic contrast.worth your time, if you like kim novak. the greta garbo of my youth.

although i agree that it's a good but not great movie, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, i still enjoy it. one reason is the music: i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers -- conte and pete -- in a well-staged scene in the nightclub. these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day, and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of stewart's ears. the candolis really did play that well, too, though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them. i don't know much about george duning, who gets the credit for the music (other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch.

this may not be war & peace, but the two academy noms wouldn't have been forthcoming if it weren't for the genius of james wong howe...this is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction. whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not, bb&c is a visual feast.i'm not saying it's his best work, i'm no expert there for sure. but the look of this movie is amazing. i love everything about it; elsa lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown-ness; but the way it was put on film is breathtaking.i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above, and the "special effects" that seem backward now. it all creates a really consistent world.

bell, book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). it made novak a huge star, put a nice item on jack lemon's resume, cast new light on jimmy stewart, and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious "old bats", in film and television).along with the 40s movie i married a witch (which helped to make veronica lake an icon), bell, book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic, worst witch and harry potter.what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie. the story takes place over the christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).i will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. it has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. and like adam's rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times.

as a pagan, i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance. it's a "fun" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all, and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way. that's a lesson everyone needs to learn, not just pagans.that having been said, this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart.hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca, elsa lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as ms. jane marbles of "murder by death") was wonderful as ms. novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie. also starring jack lemmon (wonderful performance) and jim kovacs (brilliantly witty)."witches can't cry. why, they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick. they don't have time for silly things such as love." queenie.gillian holroyd (novak) and her brother nicky (jack lemmon) are manhattan witches. cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft, they live among other new yorkers as one of them, without so much as causing a raised eyebrow. but then, along comes shepherd "shep" henderson (stewart), a steadfast, no-nonsense, dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillian's old college rival. by a quirky mishap of chance, he finds himself moving into gillian's building and is instantly "bewitched" by her charm and grace. by the use of magick, with a little help from pyewacket (gillian's familiar, trained by robert e. blair) and queenie, gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy.but magick should never be used to control, nor to hurt, and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way. not only does she have to face what she's done, but she has to face shep in her guilt. from the critical perspective; however, the movie takes a serious turn: the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp. some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home, but at least the characters were quirky and fun.on a personal note, pyewacket steals the show. great cat! great training by robert e. blair. as a note of trivia, this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom. this introduces the original samantha and darrin. all the characters of note are present and accounted for. you have but to look, to see it for yourself.this is one of my favorites, and i watch it often.this movie gets a 9.1/10 from...the fiend :.

the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher. james stewart may get top billing, but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. the lead pairing is, in fact, one of the movie's few weaknesses: the gray-haired stewart seems a bit old for the role, and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook. (it is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians.) curiously, the stewart-novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in "vertigo", released the same year as this film, but then "vertigo" had a compelling suspense story, and the benefit of alfred hitchcock's direction.the film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast, including a young jack lemmon (as kim's warlock brother), elsa lanchester (their ditzy aunt), and ernie kovacs (!) as a befuddled writer. hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch. there's lots to like in this movie--wit, romance, and a great cast--that is, if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak. i have seen the movie a half a dozen times, and i never can.

by some happy coincidence the same year that jimmy stewart and kim novak made alfred hitchcock's haunting masterpiece "vertigo", they also made this light comedy. perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the hitchcock film . at any rate this a great companion piece to "vertigo" as it again explores a very un-likely but powerful romance. in fact the film can be seen as the flip side of "vertigo" with it's happy ending. here again novak undergoes a transformation, in vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal. stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her. unlike vertigo the two come together in "bell book and candle" , a perfect antidote for the hitcock movie. again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein. the cast is terrific. lemmon hilarious as novak's warlock brother and elsa lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt. ernie kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course hermoine gingold playing novak's competitor are all great. the scene with stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it's best. anyone who has seen vertigo or even if you haven't should see this memorable light comedy.

made in the same year as "vertigo," this is an equally bewitching movie, though in a much lighter vein. it's set in an enchanted new york during the winter: kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart, but gets caught in it instead. the interesting sidelight is that novak's rival is played by janice rule, who originated the part of madge in "picnic" on broadway (the part that novak would make famous on film).

this is a wonderful film, makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish. kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern-day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in infinity. all the supporting performances are terrific, from jack lemmon as her bother nicky to ernie kovacs as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in manghattan, to elsa lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy aunt queenie. and then there is the cat- i have no idea how many witches (besides me) have named a cat pyewacket but suggest a zillion. jmes stewart looks out of place, but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub-world of magic and witchcraft. perfect. and it has the perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings. gillian and shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie allnut in the african queen (another great film)

the play bell, book, and candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road. one famous story, told by director harold j. kennedy, has ginger rogers insisting that her then husband, william marshall, who was not an actor, costar with her. marshall wore a toupee, and when he walked through a doorway, his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind, dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage.the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak, james stewart, jack lemmon, elsa lanchester, hermoine gingold, ernie kovacs, and janice rule. it's light entertainment, about a normal-appearing family of witches (novak, lemmon, and lanchester) and the publisher (stewart) who lives in their building. the most expert of them is the sultry, soft-voiced gillian, who would love to be normal. one night, with stewart in her apartment, she puts a spell on him using her siamese cat, pyewacket, and he falls in love with her."bell book and candle" was filmed on a charming set that replicates new york. the movie is loads of fun. jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as gillian's brother, a musician in the witch and warlock-laden zodiac club. he uses his powers to turn streetlights on and off and to turn on the occasional woman. janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of gillian, now dating stewart, and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches. lanchester and gingold, of course, are always wonderful, lanchester gillian's daft aunt and gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft.kim novak is a good fit for gillian, giving the character a detachment befitting a witch, showing emotion when it becomes appropriate, and with that voice, fabulous face, and magnificent wardrobe, she certainly is magical. stewart, in his last foray as a romantic lead, costars with novak as he did in vertigo, and they make an effective team. he supplies the warmth, she supplies the coolness, and somehow, together they spark. in this, of course, he's much more elegant than in "vertigo." a charming film, good for a sunday afternoon, good around christmas (as part of it takes place at christmastime), and great if you feel like smiling.

this movie was like any jimmy stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.kim novak's performance as gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad!

stewart is a distinguished bachelor and a successful executive who is about to marry his fiancée janice rule but instead gets involved with a capricious, sensual art dealer (kim novak) who turns out to be a greenwich village witch novak desires earnestly and intensely to love, but is unable to feel it...stewart slowly falls in love with her, and looks for a way to free her from her witch-spell... novak resents his well-intentioned concern, as does her siamese cat, pyewacket... still, stewart continues in his attempts to change her into a loving, feeling woman as he aspires to marry her...also blocking his way are such talented supporting actors as novak's brother (jack lemmon), a silly, charming sorcerer who can walk nonchalantly through walls; a terrible author who is writing a book about witchcraft; and the head of the association of manhattan witches, none other than the incredible hermione gingold...novak's aunt queenie (elsa lanchester), unlike her other relatives, is a tender witch who accepts that nothing should prevent the course of true love... she aids and stimulates them in turning novak into the woman of stewart's dreams, for a happy ending...if you like to see a lightweight comedy about magic, fantasy and love; beautiful cinematography; stunning use of color; and with an exceptional cast; don't miss this enjoyable and amusing movie

i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians. with the exception of stewart and novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village. i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell, book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. it was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and i planned on being bored. but, i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. as the glorious george duning love theme soared, i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. the first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater. i am sure i'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak's startling, direct gaze. it's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. i am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .

at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama.but after buying it and seeing it, it wasn't that bad. i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing. now i understand. the radio show was a super propaganda radio program. ilse , johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories. the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels,in berlin and hamburg, and record sales only. this is why ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture. this would be made up by medium budget musical ,were making music, 1942, in which she would demonstrate her whistling.but this is an excellent example propaganda.inge and her aunt eichhorn,played by ida wust, goes to the 1936 olympics. the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets. she meets carle radditz, who plays herbert, who has an extra ticket. she goes with him and it's love at first sight. they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side.carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain. when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking.you see the nazi soldiers acting normal,like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs. this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism. the character was a butcher now soldier . this was a subtle put down against meat eating.late on in world war 11, herbert is flying in a german airplane. we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over. we shoot his plane. they crash. unfortunately for us they survive.another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church ,now it's putting the catholics down, and hubert's best friend helmet,played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ, beethtoven, .more bombs come in from us. the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave. we end up injuring him. propaganda message? the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it.it injured him. see? by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma, played hedwig bleibteu, the same german grandame actress who played maria holst's aunt in weiner blut.well ,later it comes to the short view of the radio show. this was not intended to be a musical revue, such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol, the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop. it was mainly a war romantic movie.it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause, cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive. after the war many of them who survive would regret it. this is a good swastika classic. the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads, who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their. they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity . be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics. if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it ,then its a nazi website skip it .go to ihf or german wartime films dot com, amazon dot dee or german video dot net. they are legitimate. 01/23/10 mada a mistake it wasn't herbert's friend that got killed at the church . it was malte yager's character's friend schartzscop.

working-class romantic drama from director martin ritt is as unbelievable as they come, yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars jane fonda and robert de niro (both terrific). she's a widow who can't move on, he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. adaptation of pat barker's novel "union street" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland, and the film's editing is a mess, but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. there are no overtures to serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story) and no real fireworks, though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. the finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way. *** from ****

i thought this movie was really really great! helena did an amazing job in it! i thought she played her character very well! she's an awesome actress!! :)the movie was also really funny too! the jokes were great! i couldnt stop laughing! :)i think everyone should see it... :)

 i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same. mainly because of my feelings at the end. i and all the people around me were simply touched. this is something you don't often feel . we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films. the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard, a man on the verge of a breakdown. this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous, humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie. the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role. the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie. the title comes from richards masterpiece, a plane made of junk and his old paintings. flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end. a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone. don't let the subject matter put you off.

i had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication. and it's still not at the top of my list. but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, and rescue this from being just another tear-jerker. carter's depiction of an als victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings). but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance.

this was one of those times when i had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me. the theory of flight grabbed me and held my interest. i found it both touching and amusing, a nice combination of feelings. i recommend it!

helena bonham carter is the center of this movie. she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity. kenneth branagh was tolerable. the movie itself was good not exceptional. if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing.

this is the best movie i've seen since white and the best romantic comedy i've seen since the hairdresser's husband. an emotive, beautiful masterwork from kenneth branagh and helena bonham carter. it is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more recognition.

i saw this film without to know what about were... i'm a fan of branagh, even more his shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, i saw it only for this... and i finished with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about life of helena's girl. recommended to people who are bored with tv programming (in spain, at least).

this movie truly captures the feeling of freedom.......and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth....in the most delightful, light-hearted way. not a serious, but hilarious adventure.the story mirrors life. we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we wanted....which results in us getting more than we thought we would get! you will get this once you see the movie. and this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one's life.it is one of my all time favorites......not easy to find but worth the hunt.........i guarantee you will watch it more than once!

a bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. a wheelchair-bound young woman jane hatchard(helena bonham carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver, richard(kenneth branagh). richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. he builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. he wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. she offers herself to richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. i found this flick ambitious and humorous. even in this role, carter has a certain charisma and likability.

i found this movie quite by accident, but am happy that i did. kenneth branagh's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter, but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie. this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson. carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time. portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off, but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life, she made it so believable. if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women "uglying" themselves up for roles (charlize theron, halle berry), i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar. if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did, trust me, it is worth the lost sleep.

imagine the plight of richard, a painter, whose real passion is flying. when we first meet him, he is seen atop a building in london wearing his home made wings. he has ripped his canvases and other works, at the height of his despair, and fashions a flying device for his jump. when he falls into the protective police contraption, he doesn't suffer a scratch, but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. richard, whose relationship with anne apparently ended badly, decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane.richard ends up trying to help jane harchard reluctantly. she is a young woman suffering from a.l.s., or lou gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair. jane is extremely intelligent, but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary. she uses a hand held device to speak sometimes, as her speech is not clear. what jane loves to do is to lose her virginity, at any cost. jane and richard clash as they meet, but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another.jane, who watches porn on her computer, has a notion for finding someone like richard gere in "american gigolo", who will, for a fee, have sex with her. when richard takes her to london, they find the right man for the job. his fee is exorbitant, but they agree. since they have no money, richard decides to rob a big bank. unfortunately, things don't go according to plan when jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted. at the end, richard takes jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life, something that brings them closer, as they find an affinity with one another.peter greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation. jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films, and yet, she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish. mr. greengrass shows an affinity richar hawkins' material he wrote for the film. the movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease.helena bonham carter is the main reason for watching the film. she makes a wonderful jane. on the other hand, kenneth branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy. somehow, he has problems of his own in the way he interprets richard. gemma jones has some good moments as anne, richard's former love."the theory of flight" shows a good director. no doubt peter greengrass will go to bigger and better things.

although this movie has some weaknesses, it is worth seeing. i chose it because of the cast, and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past. both portray very troubled people, complete with warts, but make them likeable because of their humanity. the story is touching, but it is the performances that soar. bonham carter's "jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before, but was interesting as well for other reasons. i felt the movie ended too abruptly, but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending (see "stepmom.") the very real english setting added to my enjoyment - it was england in the 90's, both urban and rural, without being depressing.

shamefully, before i saw this film, i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter.i had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. she pulled it of flawlessly.who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? well, they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did in this wonderful movie. i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie. i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did. thank you for letting me express my opinion.

at the start, this one is from england, so, of course, i had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema. i never heard of this film before. from the minute i saw helena bonham-carter, i said to myself : oh! here's comes the feminine version of my left foot. i was right, but i was also wrong. wrong because the two movies are very differents. my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie (not because this is funny, but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day-lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. here, very beautiful bonham-carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. the story is well written and it's very intelligent. for me, miss bonham-carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's, with emily lloyd in breaking the waves. gee! and look at her eyes! she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston, louise brooks, michele morgan and ava gardner! she's also a true talent, as seen on many other movies. see this one, you won't regret it! and a very fine job by branagh too!

loved this film. real people, great acting, humour, unpredictable. the characters were believable and you really connected with them. if you're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other, this would be a good choice.

this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als (lou gehrig's disease)sufferer. the subject is done with compassion as well as humor. helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting. kenneth branagh, a superb actor, lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison time. watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end. tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances. one comes to care deeply for the two of them.

despite its low-key release in this country, and its apparent disregard in other countries (the 'r' rating in the states can't have helped - honestly, just because hbc uses the c-word!), this is actually a fine piece of work. the sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it, but it's overcome by the playing of the two leads.it's easy to win plaudits just because you're playing a physical or mental cripple (daniel day-lewis, geoffrey rush, dustin hoffman, etc.), and helena bonham-carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of mnd, but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely. in fact, almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes (and what eyes!). this is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her english rose reputation, and emerging as a figure of some stature. awards must surely follow, though not, alas, for this fine performance.branagh, one feels, has never quite given his best on film (except possibly 'hamlet', and there his playing was diluted by the large cast). here, though, he tops his other appearances, playing to the hilt a self-loathing, unstable, ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he hasn't always displayed, and exhibiting both intelligence and depth. in short, we believe him, just as much as we could not believe him as frankenstein, as the priest in 'the proposition', as the lawyer in 'the gingerbread man', even as andrew in 'peter's friends'. this is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier?as a film, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars it probably wouldn't amount to very much. but it's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this, and i eagerly await more from them (though not 'love's labour's lost'...). 8 out of 10, but branagh and hbc get 10 out of 10.

not wishing to give *anything* away here, i would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment: it will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. most definitely recommended.a previous user's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham-carter's outstanding performances - i agree entirely....

the theory of flight is an engaging character study of an artist (branagh) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (bonham-carter) in the last stages of asl, confined to a wheelchair, who desires to make love to a man before dying.helena bonham-carter exudes wit, defiance, and independence as an asl patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her.kenneth branagh, sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her, complements helena's charm with woeful melancholy, creating a sentimental, compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness, before time runs out.

the show is really funny. nice theme. jokes and one liners are really good. with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show. but the only major negative point of this show is the cast. david spade does a great job as russell, megyn price does a good job. but who the hell did cast patrick warburton, oliver hudson and bianca kajlich.technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show, which make viewers wanna watch the show. russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man, the relationship wiz... with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship.patrick warburton - does a horrible job as jeff, he is not at all suited for the role. he is like a robot, literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery. cast is really very important for viewers to like it. the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill...

i missed almost all of the first season, but when the other shows went to reruns, i started watching. i ended up buying the entire first season off itunes. this is now one of my favorite comedy shows. patrick warburton is the key. his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time. david spade is funny, but sometimes a little russell goes a long way. i enjoy the other cast members more (but not saying he doesn't add to the show).do yourself a favor. if you haven't checked this one out, give it a try. if you can catch the episode where "jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you will see how good this show is.i hope this series has a long run.

this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of "everybody loves raymond". warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. after having raved over the british series, "coupling" i can see from just where the creators of "rules of engagement" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia, i can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously "canned" laughter. surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.

i really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as i hoped it would be, if not better. patrick warburton was a riot, although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character. him and megyn price had little chemistry at all, but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other. it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show ["grounded for life"] to being a co-star. bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene, but i think in time they'll get better. david spade's character, to my surprise, wasn't the whole focus of this pilot. the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv, but i think that it is just his style. it works for him.i think that couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions, that this show is about. all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life, not sugar-coated like most shows.i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance. this show has the potential to be one of the best series, if just given the chance and time.

generally speaking, the plot was much better than i was expecting. the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way; however, there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it. my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers. spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions, but his character comes across quite well in the pilot. there is is enough eye-candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them. now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun.

this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. as a man married for 26 years, i empathize with patrick warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that. i also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. a nice ensemble of characters. this will be a nice addition to the monday night line-up.i don't know how david spade will be in his role. he is best enjoyed in small doses. he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops.

saxophonist ronnie bowers (dick powell) wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood. he stays at hollywwod hotel (of course). at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall (lola lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture. in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia (rosemary lane) to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall. naturally they fall in love. you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself.the plot is old (to put it nicely) but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices. the score is good (highlighted by "hooray for hollywood") and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence (with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn). also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie.still the movie isn't that good. the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny. lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy. also there is racism--a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist "humor" at one point. that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time. i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today.all in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. i give it a 7.

when we talk hollywood hotel we could be talking about one of three things, the actual hotel, the radio program, and this film which was partially inspired by the first two. dick powell was the host of the hollywood hotel program on cbs radio network in which louella parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars.powell and parsons debuted the hollywood hotel program in 1934 so by 1937 it had its fair share of the radio audience. powell hosted, sang, and kibitzed with louella and her movie star guests. with the power she had with her column, she was able to get the various stars to go on and plug their latest films for nothing.then the american federation of radio artists stepped in and demanded she pay wages accordingly and they won the case. that ended the hollywood hotel program in 1938. of course both powell and louella went on to other radio venues. the whole story is covered in the tony thomas book, the films of dick powell.but before the plug was pulled this film came out from powell's home studio of warner brothers inspired by the radio program. powell plays a singer/saxophonist with the benny goodman band who gets signed to a hollywood contract. but when he gets out to hollywood he gets himself tangled up with an egotistical film star lola lane, her lookalike double real life sister rosemary lane, and a ham actor in alan mowbray.when mowbray is called upon to sing in a civil war epic he's making with lola lane, it's powell's voice they use. then mowbray develops a lina lamont problem when he's asked to go on the hollywood hotel radio program, broadcast from the hollywood hotel. that's got the studio in a tizzy. let's say the problem isn't solved the way it is singing in the rain, but powell's manager ted healy proves to be resourceful.richard whiting and johnny mercer provide a really nice score for the film. the big hit song comes right at the beginning as the benny goodman band with scat singing johnnie davis sing hollywood's anthem, hooray for hollywood. my favorite however is powell and rosemary lane singing, i'm like a fish out of water. just listening to johnny mercer's lyrics about ginger rogers running the brooklyn dodgers or sally rand without her fan, it's a compendium of american popular culture in the thirties.busby berkeley does the choreography here and while the film doesn't have the soaring imaginary stuff that his earlier work with warner brothers has, the numbers are well staged. berkeley's big moment is in a drive-in eatery where powell and healy have been forced to take jobs. the number starts with benny goodman broadcasting from the hollywood hotel doing let that be a lesson to you and then at the drive-in powell, lane and the entire place start joining in song to the exasperation of owner edgar kennedy. and you know what you can expect from edgar kennedy exasperation.benny goodman gets to show why he was named the king of swing when the band with drummer gene krupa and xylophonist lionel hampton as part of his ensemble. that together with frances langford singing as well. and possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a fellow who had a small bit as a radio announcer. he died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th president of the united states. ronald reagan always credited dick powell and pat o'brien as being the two guys on warner brothers who were the most helpful to an eager young player looking to make his mark.hollywood hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture, dated, but charmingly so.

"hollywood hotel" has relationships to many films like "ella cinders" and "merton of the movies" about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood, only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non-existent. in fact, as i was watching it tonight, on turner classic movies, i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic "singing in the rain" may have taken some of their ideas from "hollywood hotel", most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen."hollywood hotel" is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s. among the supporting players is louella parsons, playing herself (and, despite some negative comments i've seen, she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines). she is not the only real person in the script. make-up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another.this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr. ronald reagan, playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere. reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people.dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest, and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman's band. the beginning of this film, by the way, is quite impressive, as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell. they end up singing "hooray for hollywood". the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose. throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make-up king, rin tin tin, and even a hint of tarzan. but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power. obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox, and the name donald duck was substituted. in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman's orchestra at their best. so did a later five minute section of the film, where the band is rehearsing.powell leaves the band and his girl friend (frances langford) and goes to hollywood, only to find he is a contract player (most likely for musicals involving saxophonists). he is met by allen joslyn, the publicist of the studio (the owner is grant mitchell). joslyn is not a bad fellow, but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them. he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel, which is also where the studio's temperamental star (lola lane) lives with her father (hugh herbert), her sister (mabel todd), and her sensible if cynical assistant (glenda farrell). lane is like jean hagen in "singing in the rain", except her speaking voice is good. her version of "dan lockwood" is one "alexander dupre" (alan mowbray, scene stealing with ease several times). the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was, and lane (when not wrapped up in her ego) is fully aware of it. having a fit on being by-passed for an out-of-the ordinary role she wanted, she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film. joslyn finds a double for her (lola's real life sister rosemary lane), and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow-up party. but she attends with powell (joslyn wanting someone who doesn't know the real lola). this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself. but otherwise the evening is a success, and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive.the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face, after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell ("and his gang of hoodlums"). powell's contract is bought out. working with photographer turned agent ted healey (actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point), the two try to find work, ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy (the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto). eventually powell gets a "break" by being hired to be dupre's singing voice in a rip-off of "gone with the wind". this leads to the final section of the film, when rosemary lane, herbert, and healey help give powell his chance to show it's his voice, not mowbrays.it's quite a cute and appealing film even now. the worst aspects are due to it's time. several jokes concerning african-americans are no longer tolerable (while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood, healey accidentally photographs a porter, and mentions to joslyn to watch out, powell photographs too darkly - get the point?). also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane, who is (shall we say) too high strung is not very tolerable either. herbert's "hoo-hoo"ing is a bit much (too much of the time) but it was really popular in 1937. and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere (this was one of his last films) reminds people of the tragic, still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937. but most of the film is quite good, and won't disappoint the viewer in 2008.

"hollywood hotel" is a fast-moving, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked. it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown -- "hooray for hollywood." the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems, however, including the charming "i'm like a fish out of water," and "silhouetted in the moonlight." the best musical number is "let that be a lesson to you," in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves "behind the eight-ball," a fate which literally befalls slow-burning edgar kennedy at the number's end. the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once, as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives. the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians--allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent, ted healy as dick powell's would-be manager, fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron, glenda farrell as mona marshall's sarcastic gal friday, edgar kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager, mabel todd as mona's goofy sister, and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad. the "racist" element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo-"gone with the wind" sequence. it's in questionable taste, but it shouldn't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film, notably the benny goodman quartet (including teddy wilson and lionel hampton!) in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo. the "dark eyes" sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late, but otherwise "hollywood hotel" is a gem, well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release.

jane eyre has always been my favorite novel! when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's i was ecstatic! this is the best and most complete version of the book on film! this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. timothy dalton is amazing as rochester. i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (zelah clark) as jane and not a glamorous person. i love the sets and the location. for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan, this is the version to watch!!! for those of you who are interested, i just found this version on dvd. i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd.

last night i finished re-watching "jane eyre" (1983), the bbc mini-series adapted from charlotte bronte's gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton (my favorite james bond) as mr. edward rochester and zelah clarke, as jane eyre, a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl, a governess at mr. rochester's estate, thornfield. "jane eyre" has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, "this book is amazing" and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it. its beautiful language, refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh, the dialogs, and above all, two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. "jane eyre" has been adapted to tv and big screen many times, 18 according to imdb. the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles, william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg, george c. scott and susannah york, ciarán hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years. of all these films i've only seen one, 300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark, brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class, he was mr. rochester - sardonic, vibrant, the force of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of thornfield. zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning, and quiet but firm willpower.added on september 17, 2007: during the last two weeks, i've seen five "jane eyre" movies and it was a wonderful experience. there is something to admire in every adaptation of "jane eyre" even if not all of them are completely successful. this version is still my favorite "jane eyre" film.

playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor, paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors who've besieged the castle before. fortunately for the fantasists, this version  with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it. it's the right length to do the story full justice, and makes considerable use of bronte's cracking dialogue; none of that modern meddling away, cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes.the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters, and the lives circumstances create for them to lead. jane  "poor, plain and little"  grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt, her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school. she arrives as a governess in the household of mr rochester, utterly friendless and alone. she represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience, but her passionate nature soon finds its touch-paper in her stern, keenly intelligent, enigmatic master, to whom she is drawn, as he is to her, by forces beyond their control. rochester is the caged tiger, busy "paving hell with energy"; potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but "pervious, through a chink or two". his character is extraordinary: he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate; but then jane is no ordinary employee, as he sees. but a dark secret, and severe trials, lie before them both.it's a pleasure to hear bronte's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a brontean scale. if you've only ever seen him as a not-so-memorable bond, you've missed the thing he's best at. those who've commented that his rochester is too handsome, miss the point of these dramatisations: his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention. timothy dalton is just right, not always or consistently handsome, but often glancingly, strikingly so, just as it should be. and zelah clarke's jane is no wallflower; she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully, allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect.not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent dramatisation of jean rhys' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to bronte, "wide sargasso sea", imagining the back-story of the first mrs rochester. do check it out  you'll never see the 'hero' of "jane eyre" in quite the same way again.

in all the comments praising or damning dalton's performance, i thought he was excellent. he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy, but as a roguish, powerful man. i liked this version, although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting, and the scenes with jane and st. john never quite gelled. i give this an 8.

the 1983 bbc production of "jane eyre" starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton (love him) has always been and will always be my favorite jane eyre. if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book, it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day. but watching this one almost equals to reading the book. i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little, and they inspired me to read the book. at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book. recently, i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed. it was only 2 hours long and didn't have many important scenes from the book (such as my favorite gypsy scene). after that i fell in love with this "jane eyre" even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story( the other versions don't, if you haven't read the book). the cast of 1983 jane eyre is excellent. it's true that timothy dalton is a very handsome actor (handsome enough to play butler in "scarlet", and julius caesar), but he is so great as rochester that i can't imagine anybody else playing this role. and zelah clarke is, without a doubt, the only jane that follows the description of the book. the other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors. jane looks so modest and naive, just as bronte describes her (although she doesn't look 18, but do you actually pay attention to that?...) some people say that this "jane eyre" is too long, but i would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version. some say the movie is dull and boring because jane is not passionate enough, or because there are not enough "kissing scenes". i hate when they make jane eyre some "hollywood movie" with inappropriate kissing scenes. you don't have to include "crazy, madly in love" scenes to show the love between jane and rochester. and both zelah and timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed!! i am 19 years old, and many girls of my age refer to this film as "boring and old-fashioned". but i can only feel sorry for them because they don't appreciate the purity and beauty of it. after all, the novel is set in 19th century, and that old-fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book. i don't think there will ever be any other version of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one. no matter who plays jane and rochester in other movies, the real jane and rochester (for me at least) will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton!

though i did not begin to read the "classics" in literature until i was 47, it's never too late. jane eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there isn't a part of the book i liked less, only parts i enjoyed more. the 1983 tv mini-series with zelah clarke and timothy dalton was everything i hoped it would be. i saw it as a full length movie in 2006. dalton's 'mr. rochester' was very good but i absolutely loved zelah's 'jane eyre'. relecting on another 'classics' movie i saw recently, i was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue. it was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of hollywood. artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism. using the title after such license is fraud. leave it to the brits to get this one right (among others). you won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it's proper context and spirit. well done bbc.

when my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on a&e from 8-9 each morning. my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. good choice.i'd forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently. timothy dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as rochester. the dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. although dalton eats a little scenery, i couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds. the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance.i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke. she is dead on as jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. criticism of her performance as "wooden" is misplaced. a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. unlike many other screen janes, she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester's attraction to her.bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity. although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery rochester. the two leads play off each other beautifully. this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever.

i have recently seen this production on dvd. it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as i remembered. at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then. (i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then) but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. i am a bit of a "jane eyre" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. i have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly. all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way, some even leave out the "rivers" family and their connection to jane altogether. i also think this is the only production to include the "gypsy" scene done correctly.the casting is perfect, zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book "small plain and dark" and i disagree that she looked too old. timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester, portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time, like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted, his expression is fantastically frightening. but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. oh to be loved by a man like that! there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things (i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).finally if you never see another production of jane eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!

this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book.what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors.the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic,while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength,courage,shyness and gentleness as jane. the story(as i'm sure most people know)is this,the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers.she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester. as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her.however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it's effects are devastating.this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy.

if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed, you need not look for it; you will find all and more in this near-perfect presentation of charlotte brontë's masterpiece.rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based, but i admit to that here. although i have not read jane eyre, i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion. i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me.i need not divulge anything in the way of plot here. let me just say this: if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre, i implore you to doubt no more! every atom of might and magic that has reared jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this film.what brontë did not bring herself, clarke and dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity. the movie's success is, no doubt, due in no small part to their acting prowess.love jane eyre or hate her, but appreciate the richness, the vitality, the truth of the story; love the characters; love the actors; all just as you would love what is great in cinema.

this is, in my opinion, much better than either of the 2 1990's versions, but is still not all that good. it feels dated, probably because it is, but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980's period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey.the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions, and st john rivers is at least covered, although not very well. timothy dalton is very good as rochester, but the actress playing jane is much too old. there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.

this was a fabulous adaptation of jane eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like zelah clarke. i thought she was too old and made jane seem much to timid. in the book jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but dalton was absolutely wonderful as rochester. he makes this version of jane eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for tv. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint however, is that zelah clarke was definitely too old.

i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r. but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short. this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed. i have seen 4 versions, orson welles is still my favorite mr r , though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york, although they were both a bit too old for the role. i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox. i would love to see those two do jane eyre.by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version, i think i was jane eyred out, but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw. i always want to go back and read the book again.

*spoiler alert: i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points, but i can't. sorry.*i was looking for an imdb review of the george c. scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version. it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though: (a)while truncated and rushed, i thought george c. scott embodied the tortured nature (and physical appearance) of the book's rochester to a t; and (b)even while looking at the dvd's cover, i was thinking "isn't timothy dalton too good-looking for the role?" the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to re-read the book while the dvd was on backorder. that said, the minute i started watching this, i was captivated. at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840's dialog spoken as written--with little or no attempts at modernization--but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly, that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech. to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus. i know someone who won't watch any versions of jane eyre because "who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic?" frankly, if someone who hadn't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions, they would think that's pretty much all the story entails--rochester's secret and its affect on everyone around him. luckily, this version is actually about jane eyre's whole life.some people have criticized the casting. dalton is too dashing; clarke is too reserved. i can't argue against the first point, but he is so "in the moment" that i believe he is rochester. to me, clarke's performance is on the mark. jane eyre is quiet, guarded. if one remembers the book, so much of the adult jane's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles. some of the criticisms baffle me. reviewers say clarke is too short or isn't pretty enough. the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is. ms. clarke shouldn't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane's declarations of her lack of beauty credible. she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall. some say there is no chemistry between the leads. what?!! the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret--and that's just the first example that comes to mind.i do agree with some of the other criticisms. i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings. some of the dialog was oddly truncated. when rochester declares, "jane, you misjudge me. i do not hate her because she is mad," i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad, he would still love and care for her. it's a powerful moment in the book, and i wish it had been included. i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own. it might have been done for clarity's sake, but i found it jarring. i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochester's ardor will cool and he'll become gruff again, but he may "like" her again by and by. dalton's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring--when rochester weeps in the library, i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene, not as rochester. as for the sets, if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960's show "dark shadows," one knows what to expect--very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors. others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make-up job rochester sports at the end. yikes! it is bad. the conclusion is too abrupt. after all that anguish and suspense, i wanted a more rounded off ending. and, on my copy of the dvd, having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25-30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much. that said, i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again.

i am a jane eyre lover and a purist, and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book, and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them. jane eyre is a complex story of great richness and can't be delivered properly in a feature-length format, so it needs a tv mini-series. timothy dalton's rochester is probably the best ever. there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age. in the book, jane (the narrator) describes him as "about 35" and not young, but not yet middle aged. i think timothy dalton was about 38 when he made this, so that is about right. also, we only have jane's opinion of whether rochester is handsome. she only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks. as an inexperienced and humble girl, i can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome. the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man, and this is fulfilled to perfection. i love the relationship between the two leads, which is the crucial thing about this story, and the humour of their encounters. other versions have blown it, but this gets it right. the 2006 version with toby stephens (aged 37 years) is in progress on bbc1 and is very good indeed, so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed.on viewing this series again, after watching the 2006 version, i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best! charlotte bronte's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story. modernisation just doesn't work - it's a victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters. this version has an excellent cast - zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important; timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor. there are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes, but leaves out unnecessary details, making it to the point and gripping. i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans.

i studied charlotte bronte's novel in high school, and it left me with a stunning impression. here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england. this young woman was jane eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own. her story, which bronte told through jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. as part of our study, we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. the mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great. both zelah clarke (jane eyre) and timothy dalton (jane's lover, by the name of rochester) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters. i cannot imagine anyone else in their roles. (the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately. i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester. zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre, but she captures jane's quiet, but firm and passionate nature brilliantly. she holds in her emotions, like the jane of the book, at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane's passionate scenes. the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester's devoted relationship.) as well, the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story. i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale. if you have not read the book before, then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.

i think this is a great version, i came on here before, to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version. i do not regret picking this version and neither will you. i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it,there is nothing like the book,and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it. when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that. i would say god personally led me to this version. it points to true love for a humans. i would say god's love is greater.if there is anything better, i would like to see it. but so far there is none like it!

there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them, but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now. it's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester, rarely missing the mark; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored, while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. zelah clarke's jane is more cerebral than otherworldly, but she makes a perfect foil for dalton (who, appropriately, towers over her!) the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing (once you've absorbed the shock of dalton's charisma). there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the bbc's standards of that time. but, it's the performances that are the real pleasure. don't miss this one!

there are many adaptations of charlotte brontë's classic novel "jane eyre", and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best. the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min. length, consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel. the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine's life.there are three tv mini series, released in '73, '83 and 2006. the 2006 version is not only the worst of these three, but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film. the novel's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones, and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book, but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set. it is a silly soap opera, in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. this "jane eyre" (as it dares to call itself) is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte brontë.the 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr. rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length. but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen. at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen, and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by jane's voice-overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess. and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured. another problem is the casting of the main characters. sorcha cusack's portrayal of jane as a bold, self-confident, worldly-wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model, and michael jayston, although a good actor, does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester. although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience.all the faults of the '73 version stand corrected in the tv mini series of '83 with timothy dalton and zelah clarke. although from a purist's point of view timothy dalton is too handsome, tall and lean to be rochester, he possesses the essential qualities for the role: he has an imposing physical presence, great magnetism and an air of self-assurance and authority. and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly. but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochester's character. of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all: rochester's harshness, nearly insolence, his moodiness and abruptness, as well as his humorous side, his tenderness, his solicitude and deep, frantic love. dalton's handling of charlotte brontë's language is equally superb. even rochester's most far-fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them. he is the definitive rochester, unsurpassed and unsurpassable, and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor.zelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester. she portrays exactly the jane of the novel, an outwardly shy, reserved and guarded young woman, but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will. she catches beautifully the duality in jane's character: her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand, and her fire and passion on the other, her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong. she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight.as regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the '73 version, but with one important difference: the dialogues are shortened in this version, but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged. thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech, while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte brontë's language. and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured.the plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the '73 series. it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel, where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of jane's life. it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel, and the only one which does full justice to the novel's pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding. timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill. he renders with almost painful intensity rochester's anguish as he realizes jane's resolution to leave him, his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him. it is a heartbreaking, almost devastating, scene, which will stay with the viewer for a long time.with even the smaller roles perfectly cast, an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true "jane eyre".

this review comes nearly 30 years late. nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that i chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight! i just had to write about it! i got smitten and forgot anything else existed once i saw this movie. how ironic it is to see literature's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man! yet, what a welcome irony! it suited me perfectly and more so because timothy dalton did full justice to his role. he delivered an astounding and triumphant performance! i have never seen anything like it! all the other actors are very good too. the whole movie was put together beautifully. i don't care what anyone says about this movie. i just love it and love it! it made me happy and satisfied. it crushes me a bit to say this but i prefer jane eyre 1983 to a&e's p&j, which i believe is the ultimate mini-series. the excerpts from jane eyre spooked me a little back in school. i never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well. seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy. the scenes and mr. dalton's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously, which, of course is a masterpiece. bravo to the whole team and especially to mr.dalton!! this movie is now a part of me.i give it 10/10 rating.

i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel "jane eyre". both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane. i've seen other versions, but none compare to this one. the best one for me. i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again. the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13. at that time, i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte's novel. i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes. i'd like to see it again because it's so good. :-)

i really have to say, this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma. and it still is. it is very, very close to the book. the way it is filmed, and the players were just all excellent! i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies, but this was really great! i gave it 10/10.

this is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the bronte work. dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared "not handsome". but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable jane eyre. this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. i own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.

i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 timothy dalton / zelah clarke adaptation of "jane eyre," because i'd just written an article about the 2006 bbc "jane eyre" for thescreamonline.so, i approached watching this the way i'd approach doing homework.i was irritated at first. the lighting in this version is bad. everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that, in some scenes, casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.and the sound is poorly recorded. i felt like i was listening to a high school play.and the pancake make-up is way too heavy.and the sets don't fully convey the gothic mood of the novel. they are too fussy, too martha stewart. i just can't see bronte's rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements. orson welles' rochester lived in cave-like gloom, very appropriate to the novel's gothic mood.and yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best "jane eyre" i've seen, it may be the best adaptation of any novel i've ever seen.this "jane eyre," in spite of its technical flaws, brought the feeling back to me of reading "jane eyre" for the first time.the critics of this production say it is too close to the book. for me, someone who valued the book and didn't need it to be any less "wordy" or any less "christian" or any more sexed up, this version's faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest asset.bronte wrote a darn good book. there's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus, while other, slicker, sexier and easier texts, have disappeared.as a long time "jane eyre" fan, i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester. rochester is, famously, not handsome; jane and rochester are literature's famous ugly couple. and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome.but dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester. he just blew me away. i've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role, the text, the dialogue, and rochester's love for jane. dalton brings the page's rochester to quivering life on screen.rochester is meant to be a bit scary. dalton is scary. welles got the scary streak down, too, for example, when he shouts "enough!" after fontaine plays a short piano piece. but dalton is scary more than once, here. you really can't tell if he's going to hurt jane, or himself, in his desperation.rochester's imperiousness, his humor, his rage, his vulnerability: dalton conveys all, sometimes seconds apart. it's stunning.and here's the key thing -- the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair, lonely, living with an ugly, life-destroying secret.no other actor i've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does. current fan favorite toby stephens doesn't even try. dalton hits it out of the park. if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar, i would say, "that guy is trouble. don't even look at him." he's that radioactive with tamped down agony.zelah clarke is not only, overall, the best jane i've seen, she's one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane. no, folks who know "jane eyre" only from the 2006 version, bronte did *not* describe a statuesque, robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips. rather, charlotte bronte's jane is, indeed, poor, plain, obscure, and little, and not pretty.zelah has a small mouth, close-set eyes, and a bit of a nose. she's truly "little." she is no fashion model. and she is the best jane, the truest to the book.some described her a cold or boring. no, she's true to the book. bronte's jane is not a red hot mama, she's a sheltered, deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments, as zelah's do here. the book's jane is someone you have to watch slowly, carefully, patiently, observantly, if you want to truly plumb her depths. you have to watch zelah, here, to get to know who she really is.i would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene, but that's one scene out of five hours in which she is, otherwise, very good.in spite of its closeness to the text, this version, like every other version i've seen, shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in "jane eyre." christianity is not incidental subtext in "jane eyre," it is central.helen burns instructs jane in christianity, thus giving her a subversive, counter cultural way to read, and live, her apparently doomed, pinched life. it is christianity, and a christian god, who convinces poor, plain, obscure jane of her equal worth, her need to live up to her ideals, and her rejection of a key marriage proposal. that isn't made fully clear here.in any case, charlotte bronte wrote an excellent, complex, rich novel, and this adaptation of it, of all the ones i've seen, mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation i've seen, and that says a lot.other versions, that don't fully honor the book, end up being a chore to watch in many places. if you don't care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse, or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money, your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochester.this version, like bronte's novel, realizes that everything bronte wrote -- about jane's experiences at lowood, and her relationship to st. john -- are part of what makes jane's relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is.

i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries. i had read and watched many classics before, and i believed that most classics were boring, over-worded, and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best. this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions.zelah clarke is a fabulous actress, and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre. her accent is delightful and her quiet, yet firm nature matches the young governess' character exactly. timothy dalton is an amazing rochester. his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall. i couldn't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries. the plot is both haunting and inspiring. the characters are masterfully performed, and the story is incredible. this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film.i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette bronte's writing. jane eyre is now my favorite film and book. if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre.

those who love the book jane eyre as i do (it's my all time favorite, and i re read it at least once a year) will love this version. timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr. rochester, but other than that, he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield. zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old jane, but when i watch this movie, i don't think about the ages of the characters. the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very smart. sure, this film might seem a little long, but it's the only version i've seen that includes part 3 of the story.i wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version, as it would have helped that mess of a film.i also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays "aunt reed"! she is so versatile that i didn't recognize her. she plays daisy in keeping up appearances, and also played mrs. musgrove in 1995's persuasion (another wonderful adaption).update: got the dvd this week, and it's marvelous to see the original unedited version. there's lots more at the beginning (young jane at gateshead and at lowood.) and at the end, they've restored lots of things, (i always wondered why st. john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version!). rosamund oliver is in it...she was completely cut out of the vhs. as far as i could tell, they hadn't edited out any of timothy dalton's parts, so nothing new there, but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs. thanks, bbc (ps...i would have paid more for a special edition dvd...with maybe some interviews with the stars...or a making of show)

this wonderful 1983 bbc television production (not a movie, as others have written here) of the classic love story "jane eyre", starring timothy dalton as rochester, and zelah clarke as jane, is the finest version that has been made to date, since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue. a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons; when film producers start to meddle with a classic's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed. thankfully the producers of this "jane eyre" approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original, which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times, to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense. the performances are delightful, the music is just right, even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful, and set the right tone for the production. my only criticism, though slight, is that this version, like every other version ever made of jane eyre, ignores the christian influences that built jane's character and influenced her moral choices. in today's modern world a woman in jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her. "oh, just get a divorce", she would say to her man, or she would live in sin with him. but jane eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself. why? this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood, not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution, but from the christian example of a true friend, helen burns, who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek. someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation. a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "even so, come lord jesus!" should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it.

yes, this production is long (good news for bronte fans!) and it has a somewhat dated feel, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won't want to watch any other versions!timothy dalton is edward rochester... it's that simple. i don't care that other reviewers claim he's too handsome. dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy. in fact he possesses a craggy, angular dark charm that, in my mind, is quite in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine mr r. and he takes on rochester's sad, tortured persona so poignantly. he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it, but also displays rochester's tender, passionate, emotional side as well. (imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout. i've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast.)when i reread the novel, i always see zelah clarke as jane. ms. clarke, to me, resembles jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). small, childlike, fairy... though it's true the actress doesn't look 18, she portrays jane's attributes so well. while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional, one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and "passionate nature" in check. her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen, who was the picture of demure submission. although her true nature was dissimilar, jane learned to master her temper and appear docile, in keeping with the school's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service'. jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr. rochester. she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal. even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right, i think. no, it does not in the least resemble hollywood (thank god! it's not a hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. and for a woman like jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.the rest of the casting is terrific, and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. so, too, is much of the rich, poetic original dialogue. this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and in general, features more humor than other versions i've seen. in particular, the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!jane eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and, at last, as rochester's true equal. just beautiful!

it holds very true to the original manga of the same name, aka (tramps like us in the u.s) but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga. it's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else. however, because of her outward strength, she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments. the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet...human...momo. if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama (japanese drama) actors/resses then this is definitely the series to watch...and read!

i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year. i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my japanese. my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird, but i found it delightful! koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit made my day every time i tuned in! i first saw him on "hana yori dango", but i liked him much better in this!although the characters are interesting and well-developed, i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show. their relationship grew, but they didn't really. still, a fun time had by all (even for fukushima!).

i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has. i found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see. i wasn't disappointed in what i saw; i was moved. this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes. sumire iwaya, played thoughtfully by koyuki, shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown. no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate. so instead she substitutes a human, played by an adorable matsumoto jun, as a pet. this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. the difference; he can retaliate in the same way, after all momo is a man, not a dog. as he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations how a dog might react. she spends time with the new boyfriend, momo gets jealous. it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - momo is a dance prodigy. her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts. matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning, to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer, to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man, not as a dog. in my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop. plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too. neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as momo (the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy) states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last. watch this show with a open mind, it's worth it.

kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day. she decides to bring him in and fix his cuts. she then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work. when she gets home however she finds that he is still there. he tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin. in desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay. and as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him. (not in that perverted way!) to her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as momo, her pet.

stupid, stupid, stupid. i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress' today, but a movie like this isn't just worth her time. she deserves better, and so does everyone else in this movie. talent is just wasted. sorry, but i don't feel like writing a review for this.i give it no stars out of *****.

this truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters, just about every voluptuous middle-aged female in hollywood, and a touching, funny love story. the capomezza's and the malacici's are rival caterers in an italian neighborhood in new york. they are also at opposite--extreme--ends of the taste scale. their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of romeo and juliet. naturally, they fall in love. on stage! the mayhem and confusion that this causes, as the parents feud with each other and their kids, is played out for us against the backdrop of the capomezza's magnificently tasteless home, and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings.besides the four over-the-top parents and the charming young lovers, the characters include a vaguely wise priest, a plain-speaking grandma, a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called the blessed roscoe, a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car, and two doves. there is not a sight gag or a punch line that doesn't click in this fast paced movie.even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "capomezza" could be interpreted as "low-brows," and "malacici" could mean "stuck-up snobs." if you are sensitive about italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. if bette midler embarrasses you, you may not like it, because all of the women in this movie make bette midler look like martha stewart. the rest of us should love it!

first off, let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her. but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. anyhow, no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did. i watched it and absolutely loved it. yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny. it was not degrading in any way.every actor and actress did a superb job. i laughed very hard at the sexual humor. overall, i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it. it is adorable and just plain fun to watch. i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10!!!go find it and watch it!

the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. it was extremely funny. angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet. the parents are hilarious.they are caterers as well as enemies.the kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church play.they fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(spoiler ahead. i think) they sneak off after a party and do it. surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie. if you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch. if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one.

a delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet. approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one. a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers' vehicle. bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare. some people feel that all film must be "important" ---if you share those views, don't bother. the credits read "introducing" angelina jolie, which is not even close to being true, but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character, and, as always, her acting is wonderful--- and, considering her age at the time, even her dialect is pretty good. recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun. see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud.

if you only read a synopsis of the plot, this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930's. the story would seem quite contrived, the subject matter maudlin. the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct, earthy performances of the cast.i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling, rich and subtle nuances float over her face. if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel, there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters. the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed, so true. the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant: when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son, lifts him up and proudly says, "my kid!", i couldn't help remember that mr. gable's own son was born to him posthumously. this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema.

jean harlow and clark gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together.yes, hold your man can be cheesy and predictable, but that's not what i love about the movie. i love seeing harlow and gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful. it is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film.the witty dialogue, great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie. i loved this movie the first time i saw it and on each subsequent viewing i always notice at least one new detail. to me, that is a mark of a great film.the dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period (early 30's). i adore classic movies, but i admit that most of them are just average and at times don't hold my interest. hold your man is one of the exceptions.this has a lot to do with the fact that hold your man is a 'pre-code' movie. (the hays code was not enforced until a year after hold your man.) this movie could not have been made under the code. well, it could have been made, but it would have been an entirely different story. thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934. otherwise, we would have missed out on this gem.

one of the great mysteries of life, suffered from daily, is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys.worse, when the nice guys even want to marry those girls, the girls still prefer the jerks and heels, even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt, have shown they're just interested in using the girls.stu erwin is the nice guy, who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely.clark gable is the jerk, and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad note to his fans.jean harlow comes across as a more slender mae west, even sounding like la west in some of her cynical throwaway lines.somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters, intended to be bad guys -- i mean, heck, they're locked up, so they must be -- are so obviously nice people.in fact, there are lots of nice people here, people who, in a lesser film or story, would be snarling and back-stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else.so, maybe the story is rather clichéd, at least by modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched.the biggest complaint i have is that so many really good actors are not given credit. once again, we can say a fervent "thank you" to imdb.com.

i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. it wasn't like that at all. clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby (jean harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. instant chemistry.she plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. the heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that eddie will never come for her. harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking ruby perfectly. she never lets gable get all the good lines! there is an especially moving scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted perfectly. the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. a truly sweet romance.

hold your man finds jean harlow, working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble. the film starts out as his film, but by the time it's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character.the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner, garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops. as he's being chased gable ducks into harlow's apartment and being he's such a charming fellow, she shields him.before long she's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets. gable, harlow, and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst, but then gable won't go through with it. of course when hurst realizes it was a con, he's still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out. but then he winds up dead outside harlow's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify. she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter.the rest of the film is her's and her adjustment to prison life. her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes. i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged.harlow also gets to do the title song and it's done as torch style ballad, very popular back in those days. she talk/sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well. gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience, a part he'd play often, most notably in my favorite gable film, honky tonk.still it's harlow who gets to shine in this film. i think it's one of the best she did at mgm, her fans should not miss it.

this movie is witty, watchable and utterly touching. and now often do you get to see jean harlow (or any actress of this era, for that matter) give another woman a swift punch in the jaw? (twice!)after harlow's ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with gable's edward hall (he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile), her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant, and she's convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but in fact, her love has reformed him and he comes to see her, despite the fact that he will be arrested, and from the help of a minister, are married.the wonderful relationship that harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with gable, who was her most frequent leading man. her cynical character is a perfect match for gable's smooth-talking crook. what's not to like?"you know, you wouldn't be a bad looking dame - if it wasn't for your face!" ruby cuttingly remarks to gypsy, her rival. "if you're going to get that close to me, i'll have to open the other window!"priceless!!!

clark gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard-boiled dame jean harlow. he tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough-gal attitude. despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love. when gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant. anita loos' and howard emmett rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype). gable and harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles. and the direction is much better than you'd expect from sam wood. one beautiful shot has harlow being inducted into the prison, then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her. this is one of the best of both the "criminals in love" and "women's prison" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written.

as romantic comedies go, this was a cute and winning one. i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better, but that is not a huge tripping point. but, amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever. these are two of my favorite actors, and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads. i hope to see them cast in more projects soon.overall, this movie won't change your life, but is is sweet, warm and winning. not a bad thing to be at all.

i´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time. or third. this movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely, amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. the plot might be not very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet. the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit. so, the sparks are on all the right places, supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel. it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening.

german private tv is ill-renowned for copying dutch and  naturally  us formats. well, in the case of edel & starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: screwball.you can't stand screwball comedy? don't watch edel & starck. seriously. if you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to law&order or something, well, go somewhere else. (or watch law&order as it's quite brilliant at what it does, but i digress.) e&s is funny, often addresses thought-provoking themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny, and witty, too.frankly, i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re: private german television productions. german residents will understand what i'm talking about.in short: watch it. i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons. pseudo-happy end included.

this series it's "something different". sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones, but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way. edel & starck is great, it has all: great plot, smart, witty, always well delivered lines, an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin, one of the most interesting city in the world. it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once "feel" the old europe way of dealing with life. kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come.watching the series in german is super.

true, the idea for this tv series may have sprung from the immense success which ally mcbeal is enjoying worldwide, even here in germany. however, this said, edel & starck is very different from ally mcbeal in many ways.the two main characters work beautifully together. felix edel (felix noble), played by well-known german actor, christoph m. ohrt and sandra starck (sandra strong - noble & strong, get it ???), played by charming rebecca immanuel, exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in berlin and surroundings. further, they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars, most notably their secretary, played by isabel tuengerthal, who is a rare gem with great comic potential. also the shady wheeler-dealer, otto, and the noble childhood pal of felix, frank, work very well, not to forget sandra's best friend and room-mate, patricia, played by the beautiful barbara demmer.all-in-all a joy to watch on monday nites: no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes. will felix get sandra ?i hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out......

how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is?? for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store - having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously, i didn't want to smear my thought process of him - so i resisted and resisted, until finally i grabbed it up with a 'what the hell!' attitude! and how surprised was i! i just wish i had purchased it earlier. having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters, yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife, who thus meets an intriguing woman, charming her in such a profound and interesting (dare i say bookish?) way, throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for.the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters - which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin, seeing his "someone special" bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life. you just really begin to feel for him.then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper - that is the turning point in marie's estimation of dan!! the look she gives him when he repeats her comment, about not liking ruthie - sheer green-eyed monster! triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! this sequence is one of the most well-crafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to marie.other gut-wrenching scenes - dan returns from the book and tackle shop, confronted by his brothers, begins to describe what has just occurred....when dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!!his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne, his late wife, brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in life.when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent show....his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song....absolute gem! the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters...they all three love their father and want to see him happy, will not let him deny his love for marie; the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock, their stronghold...and tell him so much more than that with just a few words.i could go on and on but i will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future....but i will end by saying........if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good, with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama, that never feels forced or crass, that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with his extended family, then look no further.dan in real life - 9 out of 10 for such a well-rendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche, that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive, with fine performances by the ensemble cast. i cannot wait to re-watch this again!!

this is a sublime piece of film-making. it flows at just the right pace throughout. the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film.however, despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch. i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven't experienced for a long time. that is to say, it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. 'dan in real life' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices. it has a fully matured plot that just doesn't require, and indeed would be ruined by, any further embellishment. at the same time, the theme is entirely adult. it's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers.there are some scenes that feel a bit 'waltons' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc. this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill.i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy. put aside any prejudices because this is a must see!

i watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. typically in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. but, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the romantic comedies i have seen of lately. there is a widowed guy(dan), there is a girl(marie). dan meets marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime marie has to leave. dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. marie is the girlfriend of his brother. unheeded of the circumstances, dan flirts with marie and realizes that he loves her, and even marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. how it is made possible forms the rest of the story. steve carell performs well, juliette binoche is good as marie. and every other stuff is done well. it is a good movie, watch it.

i loved the story. somewhere, a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film. well maybe there ought to be. i thought everybody seemed really human and believable. what a top notch cast. what great music on the soundtrack. what a nice this, and what a nice that, but most of all, i will say two words to recommend this film.steve carell.he really showed a nice, subtle depth that touched me. he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first, at the cost of denying his own needs.did he act like a petulant ass? why, yes he did.and you see, that's what was perfect about this film. the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something, and not simply acting like he was feeling something, and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling, and what he was feeling was denied.denied happiness.denied fulfillment.denied love.losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do so will never feel something like that again.beautiful film.i gave it an eight out of ten.

steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to(sort of) in dan in real life, a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it. not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart. we all like steve carell, this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him, but you know what, i liked this movie. carell stars as dan burns, a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him. one weekend, him and his daughters travel down to see his family. while there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman. when he gets back to his house, he finds out that his brother mitch(played by dane cook) is dating this woman(played by juliette binoche).dan in real life, at times, i found a bit unbelievable. are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things? i would highly doubt that. i don't know any family who is like that. is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up? no.dan in real life:***/****

clean family oriented movie. i laughed, i cried...i loved it. i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office. boy, was i wrong. he should win an oscar for his performance. i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out. my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this "type". i saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. only 1 cuss word! not even sure why it was pg13. i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!

i loved "dan in real life". a wonderful journey-to-love story like you've got mail or while you were sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes, and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up. dan burns (steven carrell) is a popular advice columnist who can't seem to get things in his own life straightened out. until one day, on a family gathering/trip, he meets and instantly connects with marie (the always beautiful juliette binoche)a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema. chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but marie must be off for a previous engagement, and they must part ways. later we are treated to dan's tight-knit, fun-loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes. what i liked so much was that although the family's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some, i thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that doesn't venture into parody or crude exaggeration. the burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for dan. there are wonderfully awkward family moments that aren't unrealistic. the family is nosey, but never mean-spirited or gossipy; quirky, but never outlandish.and then dan falls in love with his brother's girlfriend he's brought to the family gathering. and thus begins a roller-coaster of restrained longing and funny love-budding. i could go on but i just thought this movie was simply awesome. it's not particularly "hip" or "clever", never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema. there is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny-but-real dialogue. in fact, early in the movie, the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they're thinking out loud.so i've probably rambled and repeated myself, but i highly recommend "dan in real life". it's a great date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a geek like me you'll get a bit teary-eyed. filled with fun and magical love, "dan in real life" won't disappoint.=================== 3.5 out of 4 stars grade: a

the widower family man dan burns (steve carell) writes the column "dan in real life" giving advices for families in the new jersey standard and raises his three daughters alone. jane (allison pill), the older, has just got her driving license but dan does not allow her to drive; cara (brittany robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate marty; and the young lily (marlene lawston) misses her mother. when dan and his daughters travel to rhode island for a family reunion, he meets marie (juliette binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. they feel attracted for each other, but marie receives a phone call and leaves dan, giving her phone number first. dan immediately falls in love for marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother mitch burns (dane cook), who is also in love with her. along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy dan and marie increases and they have to take a decision."dan in real life" is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama. the chemistry of the gorgeous juliette binoche and steve carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves marie. the trio allison pill, brittany robertson and marlene lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. the screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. follow the advice of dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the burns' family. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "eu, meu irmão e nossa namorada" ("me, my brother and our girlfriend")

steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but i guess i was wrong. sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance. the movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element i found. but, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending. i'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity. still a fun movie.

dan, the widowed father of three girls, has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication. after his wife's death, he has taken time to raise his daughters. having known no romance in quite some time, nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant marie, at a local book store in a rhode island small town on the ocean, where he has gone to celebrate thanksgiving with the rest of his big family. after liking marie at first sight, little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound. after all, she is the date of dan's brother, mitch.it is clear from the outset that dan and marie are made for one another, and although we sense what the outcome will be, we go for the fun ride that peter hedges, the director wants to give us. mr. hedges, an author and screenplay writer on his own, has given us two excellent novels, "what's eating gilber grapes", and "an ocean in iowa", and the delightful indie, "pieces of april, which he also directed. it's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during thanksgiving reunions.the best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars, steve carell and juliette binoche. mr. carell, in fact, keeps getting better all the time. in many ways, he remind us of jack lemmon, in his take of comedy and serious material. what can one say about ms. binoche, an intelligent actress, and a bright presence in any film. she proves she is right up to doing comedy, convincing us about her marie.the only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture. john mahoney, diane wiest, norbert leo butz, jessica hecht, emily blunt, allison pill, amy ryan, have nothing to do. they just serve as incidental music for decoration. dane cook, who is seen as brother mitch, fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others."dan in real life" is a delightful film that will please everyone.

i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film, you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. dan in real life delivered that promise.the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss. with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche, their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys. the cast, sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead.

i saw a special advance screening of this today. i have to let you know, i'm not a huge fan of either dane cook or steve carell, so i really had no expectations going into this. i ended up enjoying it quite a bit.dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family. while at a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she happens to be his brother's girlfriend.this movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack, cinematography, and acting are all top-notch, especially steve carell. my problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, mostly with dane cook's character. we never really get a close look at the relationship between dane and steve's characters, and i felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what dan's inner conflict about being in love with dane's girlfriend was like. other than this though, dan in real life is definitely a solid, sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've been getting this year.

there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. this is exactly the case for dan burns (steve carell, the office) a columnist for the local newspaper. dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license, the middle one well into her teenage angst phase, and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood. things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore.her name is marie (juliette binoche, chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household.if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion. the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax. the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes, yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself.dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time, or even a third. just "put it on my tab."

i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan, an advice columnist, who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend. its a story thats been told before, but not like this. there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be. the cast is wonderful, and even if carell is not my cup of tea, he is quite good as the widower who's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you. at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be, the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film. worth a look see

steve carell plays dan burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls. at a large family homecoming dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.what's a man to do?i rather liked "dan in real life", but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. if you cannot accept it, fear not, "get smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record i thought he was very good."dan in real life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and carell's frustration with his situation grows. it's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "dan in real life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous juliette binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.

marie: you are smooth. dan: no, i'm not smooth. i'm dan.if you're anything like me, smooth and single do not go together. you see someone you like, rare enough as that can be, and you want to say something but you don't. or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life. more often then not though, you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk. you can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though. maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career. there are reasons, some valid, some not, and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason. you tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening. any way you break it down, it's not easy. sound familiar? if you thought yes even just a little, then dan in real life, the new comedy from director peter hedges, is a must-see. it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once.the dan from the title is dan burns (steve carell), an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced, fulfilling and morally uplifting life. four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day, he lost his wife and love of his life. after that tragedy, dan was left to raise their three daughters alone. between that and focusing on his career, finding love again was not one of dan's priorities. and so he became more functional than feeling. removed from the power of intimacy, dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again. that is, until he meets marie (juliette binoche) in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning. they're interaction is casual, comfortable and it catches both of them off guard. there is only one problem really. she is already seeing someone. unfortunately for all involved, that someone is dan's brother, mitch (dane cook). his entire family has come up to their parents' country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning. it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan's heart from its coma.with so many family members to deal with (jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm), dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time. while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan, hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract, with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film. luckily, hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden. it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes (despite the occasional evan almighty-sized misstep). he is charismatic, charming and obviously a sharp humorist. as dan, he is also self-deprecating, awkward and scared. carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona. perhaps more importantly, he is entirely relatable as dan. whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen, unable to stan d still in his anxiety, dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd. carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time.i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did, despite its slight shortcomings (juliette binoche  i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved), because of where i am in my life. would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film? i can't say. what i can say, as someone who knows what it means to be lonely, dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished. it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen.

i was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night (oct. 20) and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting.while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique, and distinctly "indy" in style. it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past, it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle-aged depressed love story.i was particularly struck by the casting of the film. down to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. the three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them "out-shone" the other two.it was truly a delightful film, appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming. it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.

i got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. it's not the typical romantic comedy. i can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. the laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of "oh, my god, i thought i was the only one who felt that way!" i won't give away the plot, which is more than just "guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." the whole family plays a part in the relationship here. probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since "while you were sleeping." steve carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time i really liked him. the cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom i've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. dianne wiest is lovely as the mother, juliette binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled dane cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. the sondre lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and i'll buy the cd the second it's available.don't miss this one.

the most satisfying element about "dan in real life" is that the relationship between dan (steve carell) and marie (juliette binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. the casting of oscar-winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson, it would have been a disaster.another wonderful aspect about "dan in real life" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. "dan in real life" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "dan in real life" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.my only problem with "dan in real life" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson. it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. but, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.all in all, "dan in real life" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. the quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. it is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.

for romance's sake, as a married man. the following two films are recommended.1. brief encounter by david lean (1945), ukwell, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. and it happened! how she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. but she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman2. xiao cheng zhi chun by fei mu (1948), chinawell, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing womanin both movies, from great directors of uk and china, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. that leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.

this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships.eventually they do become spoken, but is there a chance to change anything about the situation.originally made in shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family. there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family. history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film.a young married couple - liyan, an invalid, and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined.a bright contrast is liyan's young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way. her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor...i ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film.

this is a nice little movie with a nice story, that plays the most important role in the entire movie.it's a quite intriguing dramatic story, with also romance present in it. the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies, produced in the west. in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. not that this is a bad thing, it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.but oh well, this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.8/10

tian's remake is no good at all. i only click on his remake documentary to see wei wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew. we are going to meet wei wei this sunday (28/3/2010) after the showing of xiao cheng zhi chun in the hong kong film archiev. wei wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her cameo appearance in hong kong films is always a surprise to her fans. in this year's hong kong film festival, a special program is dedicated to fei mu, director of this epic movie and wei wei's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in hong kong. my son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised wei wei was so beautiful then.

mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in china in 1948. wei wei's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it

xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie, not only in the year it was shot but also now. it's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century. the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth!the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie: francois truffaut's "femme d'a cote" which is of the similar topic.

as others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. when men are around they want to be pursued, but when no "men" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. and the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love.

most reviews say that this is the weakest point in hamilton's short movie career. this movie is a bit different from the rest, and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie, and what you expect from hamilton.knowing hamilton as a photographer, you can be slightly surprised. while bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian, with a plot connecting these scenes, laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them (male-female, artist-model) but though we see beautiful photos, many of them better than his average, their number is reduced for the sake of the plot. tendres cousines is different from both, it is only hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos. because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than hamilton's fans, looking like an erotic comedy (but not german soft-core type - "schulmädchen report" fans would be very disappointed). you won't laugh a lot, but you can smile (and that's something you don't often get from hamilton). unlike all other hamilton's movies the age of female varies. unlike other movies main character is a boy. unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time. we have characters that live their life, have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another, from one nude girl to another.unfortunately, hamilton (again) gets lost with a script in his hands. girls on beaches, under shower, in low-light rooms, in gardens, under tents, in front of mirrors, regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory, he can shoot minutes and hours, and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it. but when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script. hamilton is best known for his nudes, but they are just a part of his work. and in tendres cousines we have a reverse situation: his girls are not in the best shots. nature, garden, house remind us on hamilton's work (often neglected part of it), while girls, even when nude, don't have anything special in the way he presents us. maybe hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera, maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept, maybe he was really trying to make something new (and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't), but he neglected what he was mostly praised for.

i like david hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood, sometimes erotic, though never pornographic. someone else liked them, too, because my david hamilton books were stolen. in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy, obviously nude, intimate with a young woman older than he, also nude. though discrete, there was strong sexual connotation. new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie tendres cousines or perhaps photos taken on set.the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. soft focus becomes out-of-focus and discrete angles become confusing, perhaps because, in motion, they cannot be considered. you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe, to comprehend. the movie is supposed to be a farce, and funny things do happen, but it doesn't "hang together," perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on. eventually, the 14-year-old julien has intercourse with his cousin, but it's soft core, with no genital contact shown on camera. since it's a farce, we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and, having caught them, julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience. in fairness, the film is in french and conforms to french cinematic forms, which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us phillistines along.it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem. nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children, so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation. guys will think "lucky julien!" even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a "bad thing," all the while still wishing they could have been a julien at that age. women, too, may have similar thoughts, but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind. hysterically, the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided. too bad, since sexual awakening is a real human experience. afer all, children do grow up and become sexual beings as julien does. it's a fit literary subject, cinema included, but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children. david hamilton, i think, was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980. he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic, and, unfortunately, we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label.

hmmmm, want a little romance with your mystery? this has it. i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie. but how could the romance be ditched when the story's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel, whatever the heck that is. had the romance been ditched, the story might have been a little too weak. the mystery here wasn't too bad, quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage. oh well. i thought mel harris was pretty good; her short skirts, i think, added some sex appeal... but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast, maybe with a more well known tv movie actor. the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier, a little darker, more adventurous. one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations. that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest. possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect. not good. had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen, picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background. this was just a tv-movie, though, so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery. overall, twasn't really a bad movie. i'll tell you what, this was absolutely the best canadian-hungarian production i have ever seen! (and the only that i know of.) i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie, giving it a grade of c-

the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between.rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap. as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it's only by five years.rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel. i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane.he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series.they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at.

the romance of the movie, which is also its main theme, is good and nicely presented. however, the surrounding of the love story is too lyric, graphical and unrealistic. even worse, the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible, exactly like the end of the movie. don't hesitate to watch this movie, if it attracted your interest, but don't expect too much of it either.

a lonely depressed french boy mathieu (jeremie elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with cedric (the gorgeous stephane rideau). quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. on one hand, i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys. on the other i was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason. it's very confusing and pointless. spoilers ahead!!!also there are tons of plot holes--mathieu, at one point, does something that ends him up in the hospital. what is it--we're never told! then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him. why? we're not told. then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end. why? no explanation. it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so... however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much. if only things were explained!elkaim as mathieu is not good. he's tall, handsome and has a nice body--but he can't act. his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face--all the time. rideau, on the other hand, is great. he's very handsome, has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor. also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. there is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great--most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes. this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other.so, a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for rideau's nude scenes--that is, if you like good-looking nude young men!

this movie has a special way of telling the story, at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening.anyway the story line was although simple, but still very real and touching. you met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony. who hasn't go through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life. i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters. i just wish that the story could be a happy ending.

this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man, and how he must deal with everyone. his mother is depressed, his younger sister is a pain, his older sister is somewhat accepting. the relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy. unfortunately, the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything. our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves, dumping his new lover and starting over. we are left with him starting over and viewing, not participating, in happiness. so maybe things will go better for him in the future. the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating.

a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy, that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy, during an vacation with a part of his family.i liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling , with all this "sound-close-ups" and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods.

most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers. this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right. it combines elements of humour, suffering, rebellion, etc. in a way that is comlex & sympathetic. the ending could be a bit clearer, but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer.

the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down-to-earth! the romance between two teen-age boys on the screen was done in good taste. you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one, you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart.

the movie is very realistic. absolutely, it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise. the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures. overall, the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state. this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent. not everything happens the way we think it should happen. i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note. we watch, we learn, we experience ourselves. that is probably the moral of this story.

this movie has everything. emotion, power, affection, stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance... it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship. just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it. i would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently, and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric. this is definitely a must-see!!!!

i'm gonna give it to ya straight...this movie is amazing. foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story. while so many american indie gay films are grainy, bad sound, amateur acting, trite story lines, and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica, top-quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france. the cinematography is beautiful, thought out, meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the acting is intense and professional. both leads are fantastic, as well as the entire cast. the boys are more than just good-looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity. you follow the entire year of these boys, from their meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship's, the details of falling in, and out, of love are there beautifully performed. it left me wanting more. check it out!

'presque rien' is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside. i don't want to tell the plot, because it's not what's most important about this film (but you can be sure that it's interesting and original). the best part of this movie is the cinematography. the visual side of 'presque rien' is so amazing it deserves highest note. it leaves you charmed with its beauty.as for the plot, it is shown in uneven, rather complicated way. there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings. but this is what makes 'presque rien' even more interesting. i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed.

there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning. and there is also emotion in the inner-workings of mathieu's family dealing w/ his mother's problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship. but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless i'm just too dumb to pick up on them). why is mathieu in a mental hospital? what led to the boys' break-up? and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first. it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity. but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying.

deeply emotional. it can't leave you neutral.yes it's a love story between 2 18 years old boys. but it's only the body of this movie. and it's been removed. you only feel what happened with these boys. you feel the soul of the movie. with of course some action, some sex, but this is no pornography, too many feelings.it was only a summer "story", and it became, from love to hate, almost to death, the most important time of their lives. i loved it, you will too, whatever your feelings are.

i liked this film very much. the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow. there is no resolution to the story whatsoever, and you are left to wonder what really happened. since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this. i especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives. and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points. ;-)

screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title ' come undone', april 25, 26, & 27, 2001. the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling. even with fall/winter backgrounds for the 'present' and spring summer for the 'flashbacks' there can be some difficulty following the continuity.whether either lead is gay, the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking. the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning. but as the end approaches, you really care about where these guys will be next summer! you, too, will want a sequel to find out.

i found this film the first time when i was searching for some works in witch stéphane rideau had participate, still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful «les roseaux sauvages» (in portuguese, juncos silvestres), by andré téchiné. i was searching for similar movies, in the come of age line. i found then «presque rien», a movie where the director sébastien lifshitz deliciously amazes us, earning a nomination by the cannes festival in 2000. the story is about two guys, the kind «boy next door», mathieu (jérémie elkaïm) and cédric (stéphane rideau), who meet during the summer vacations. in a land far from where he lives, mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister. there he meets cédric, a local, with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship, much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that stéphane rideau gives his characters, (in «les roseaux sauvages», 6 years younger, he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer, witch matures here in experience). exemplar in directing, in the amorous sequence, in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his (still ambiguous) sexuality and great love. the first love, in its terrible progression ecstasy-despair. the best of the film is the best of france: the fervent passion, the hot and excited rationalism, the brownish beauty, the simple and natural acceptance made by the families, although not without surprise and first anger. still, there is the beach, the luminosity, the lightness e simplicity of summer, the freshness of breeze, the surge&#8217;s melody, and the expressive eyes of an introverted elkaïm (hesitant, hurt, puzzled, passionate). the sex is not avoided nor exploited, it is treated as it is, with no exhibitionist intention. in virtue of pure talent, this is a work of drama of uncommon quality, without cheap sentimentalism, showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person, although with a social fear of rejection and shame. it is well worthy being seen, especially by those who adore french movies (although the dvd front cover is very lame, with the two actors in between tens of stars, greased with brilliantine). a movie witch, in my opinion, deserves an 8-9!

what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.spoiler of sorts follows.poor cedric; he apparently didn't know what hit him. poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. these two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.on a purely technical note, i loved the camera action in this film. subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my french is "presque rien." i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more. this was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. though many scenes seem superfluous, i rate it nine out of ten.

i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog. and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it. however, after a few days, i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind. my appreciation of this movie increases. it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable.as many have commented, the movie is non-linear and that's a hallmark of european film-making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors. i don't really know whether it's true or not. many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations. to those viewers, i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions. however, for others who have yet to see the film, do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise.the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods. pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods. it is also not as confusing as suggested; just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end.yes, lots of things are left unsaid or not shown, and lots of situations are left unexplored. but isn't that what life is like? a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends/loved ones unless you confront them and even then, you can never be 100% sure if they told you the whole truth. this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions. the movie does, however, leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions. for example, mathieu is manic depressive, to the point of suicidal. why? i don't know, maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it; maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need; maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric, rearranging and indeed, shattering his life to be with him, he realizes that it is all "coming undone". i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off, mentality fragile by that scene w/ the dead bird. maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him. but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w/ the stray cat. also, there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt. the doctor asks him if everything is okay, and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once, but that's nothing, according to cedric. is that the only reason, we don't know, there are probably others, all mixed up together. is it paramount that we know exactly what they are? i don't think so, for this movie. another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene. mathieu is interested in studying the ruins, cedric is not. he is the one w/ the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs.finally, the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet. i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end.i have two complaints for the dvd. one is the sound. it's very soft. i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene, it became too loud. the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off; they stay on the screen. most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately.

first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.the core story is of mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets cédric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday with his family. as the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. a year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: cédric cheats on mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. he survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see stéphane rideau (cédric) used to his full capacity (i'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morel's rather limp dramas), jérémie elkaim (mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning the film's title "presque rien" (almost nothing) points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film: in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him "non enfin, oui une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (no well, yes once, but it was nothing). cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to mathieu.whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope: we get to see cédric's slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre, who may be his next love. but here the story ends: a teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. so what was it? almost nothing? certainly not when you're living it

stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in "wild reeds," and he is one of france's biggest indie stars. in this film, he plays cedric, a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu (newcomer jamie elkaim, in a stunning, nuanced, ethereal performance) at the beach. mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother, demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). soon, the two are falling in love.the film's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs, bits and pieces of the present, and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. director sebastien lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in, and the story line can be difficult to follow. but stick it out: the film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. by turns heart-breaking and uplifting, this film ranks with "beautiful thing" as must-see cinema.

maybe "presque rien" is not the best movie ever made... but it is better than many of you have said. i still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one.you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome. but european movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel.many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. the purpose of this one is not show us a simple "summer loving movie", with commercial characters who "fall in love and live happy forever". summer holidays and beach are only a background, and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks. these 3 moments are: - summertime in pornichet, when they meet and love. - after a year and half living together in nantes, mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. he tries to suicide taking something, and cedric brings him to hospital. later, he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - the last part, is when mathieu come back to pornichet, in winter, alone.. to think about how his life have changed, how his life become to be, and trying to find himself.it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them. but anyway, as i said before... this is not a funny movie. if what someone want to see is meat, for that, we have belami movies.presque rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. but what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought, and he become troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. so, funny? is not a funny movie. very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness... i, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life.for me, the best homo-themed movie ever.

an adult, realistic, cruel, dark story, like a second part of "les roseaux savages" (the wild reeds), plenty of beauty and sadness, ellipsis and silences, shadows and little sparks of hope. a man searching for a warm companion, a better life, a sincere attitude.

'presque rien' ('come undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director sébastien lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer stéphane bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'wild side'). as we come to understand lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable. by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses. it takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.mathieu (handsome and gifted jérémie elkaïm) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (dominique reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise annick (marie matheron) and accompanied by his sister sarah (laetitia legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons. weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder. we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.while sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion. the youth cédric (stéphane rideau) follows mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. soon cédric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession. mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs cédric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations. the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes. yet as the summer wears on mathieu, a committed student, realizes that cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival. it becomes apparent that cédric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for cédric. their moments of joy are disrupted by cédric's admission of infidelity and mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways. time passes, family changes are made, and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt. the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of cédric's past lovers pierre (nils ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.after viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful. lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making. in french with english subtitles. highly recommended. grady harp

"come undone" appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum. granted, it's a film that promises a take on gay life, as most viewers expect and somehow, it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man's soul. the film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended. it is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that, in the end, will leave mathieu confused, hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be.if you haven't seen the film, perhaps you would like to stop reading.sebastien lifshitz, the director of the film, has told his story from mathieu's viewpoint. most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film, but there are hints that are not obvious, as one can see, in retrospect. the story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film. this is a story about the doomed the love mathieu felt for cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together.first of all, cedric, the handsome young local, pursues mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him. mathieu feels the attraction for cedric too. we realize how different both young men are by the way cedric tells mathieu's family how he feels school is not for him. on the other hand, mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where cedric has taken him. we watch as mathieu, reading from the guide book, wants cedric's attention.when mathieu comes out to his mother, she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career. she also points out about what future both of them would have together, which proves to be true. mathieu appears to have learned his lesson, the hard way. he goes on to an uncertain life with cedric and attempts to take his own life. we watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul.the ending might be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the film when mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to pierre, the young man who frequents the bar. that is why when mathieu goes looking for pierre at his house, appears to be hard to imagine. yet, we have seen the way mathieu is obviously interested in pierre. the last scene at the beach, when pierre and mathieu are seen strolling in the sand, has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy, apparently lost, but then realizing the father is nearby.jeremie elkaim makes mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. this is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level. mathieu has suffered a lot, first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and with losing cedric. stephan rideau, who has been seen on other important french films, is equally good, as the shallow cedric.while "come undone" will divide opinions, the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care sebastien lifshitz gives to the story.

'presque rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual. eschewing both stereotypes and preaching, it's a wonderfully naturalistic film, superbly acted, shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place, never melodramatic but often painfully real. if anything it's almost too realistic, as there's little in the way of conventional plot, just scenes from a life. but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn. 'presque rien' might not be the most exciting film ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme. worth a watch.

only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie. and after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, i decided that i liked it tremendously. i love american films - probably because they are so narrative. they usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. "presque rien," on the other hand, makes no such attempt. i disagree with other posters that say it's 'too artsy.' in every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. so often throughout the film you feel like you're there... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc.in every way, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them. after i finished watching it, i felt the same. but upon some reflection, i recognized that this is how the movie had to be: the 'story' isn't the narrative, it's the emotions you (the viewer) feel.the lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they're rich, exquisite, and alive with detail and nuance. although i normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot (after all, isn't a movie 'supposed' to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.

lily mars, a smalltown girl living in indiana, dreams of making it big on broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful broadway producer john thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. lily tries everything she can to get thornway to notice her, but he just gets annoyed with her antics. when thornway goes back to new york to stage his show, lily follows (unknown to john of course) and thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family, however thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms, which makes the show's leading lady, isabel rekay, jealous. when isabel gets fed up with the john-lily romance causing friction with the show, she leaves, and john decides to make lily the star. isabel returns later, and thornway is forced to tell lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play, which also may jeopardize the romance. very charming film, and a refreshing change to see garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of lady macbeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career) i enjoyed heflin's character (thornway) more when he was annoyed with lily rather than be the romantic. the film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together, but a very enjoyable film. rating, 7.

in this 1943 film, judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-van heflin. this film was certainly a big change for mr. heflin, especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in "johnny eager."wasn't spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?the singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. it was a gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer.

presenting lily mars (mgm, 1943) is a cute film, but in my opinion it could have been better. judy garland is great as always, but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van heflin develops all too quickly.i mean, one minute he's ready to beat her butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. i believe that this production, the film editing, and the script ( even though the photography was great, the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well) could have been a little better. it feels as though the production was too rushed. the supporting cast was good as well, especially little janet chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter rosie. she at the age of 11, looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress. she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's (except for broadway musketeers 1938, she's really good in that), when they tried to make her into a shirley temple/sybil jason hybrid. overall, this film could better, but in the end, judy gave it her all.

presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland, along with her standard singing moments. the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break. i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here. i really recommend this film for everyone. judy is breathtaking in this role!

presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. ok now that you know my bias, here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out.1. although the basic plot - lily mars (judy garland) goes to new york, becomes a star, and wins the heart of her director (van heflin) is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period, the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. although lily gets her big break when the star quits, she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show.2. judy garland (enough said!)3. the supporting cast includes some really great performances. spring byington as lily's mother is truely wonderful, as is fay bainter (the mother of the director - john thornway (van heflin)). the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie, a one time actress turned theater custodian.worth a watch for sure. one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.

almost every review of this movie i'd seen was pretty bad. it's not pretty bad, it's actually pretty good, though not great. the judy garland character could have gotten annoying, but she didn't allow it to. somewhere along the line, i've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting van heflin, at least in the early 40's. judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. i gave it a 7.

presenting lily mars may have provided judy garland with one of the easier roles she had while at mgm because lily mars is definitely a character she could identify with. a young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer van heflin from her home town discourages her.i really liked judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater. because it is judy garland with the talent of judy garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes van heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced.both judy and heflin hail from the same small town, heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on broadway, their respective moms, fay bainter and spring byington have kept in touch. that's her entrée, but heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids, but never anyone quite like lily mars.no real big song hits came out of presenting lily mars for garland, though she sings all her numbers. the best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut, every little movement has a meaning all its own. judy sings it with connie gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a broadway theater where heflin's show is being produced. gilchrist was a star back in the days of the floradora girls and she and judy deliver the song in grand style with connie. it's the best scene in the film as gilchrist encourages judy to keep at it. composer karl hoschna had died a long time ago, but lyricist otto harbach was still alive and i'm betting he liked what he heard.european musical star marta eggerth is in presenting lily mars as the show's star who's at first bemused, then angry and finally, understanding of garland and heflin. she did a couple of films with mgm and then went back to europe for more work on the continent. i'm betting mgm didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick hungarian accent, though louis b. mayer never met a soprano he didn't like.van heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from garland and eggerth. heflin was just coming off his oscar for johnny eager the previous year and he and garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team, but they're not bad together.presenting lily mars is a fine showcase for the talents of judy garland. and she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with mickey rooney.

this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak (looks wise). in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated. well in this film she looks perfect. she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy.i think this film is hilarious, especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway. one of the funniest scene's in my opinion is judy's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking (lol).one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love. i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love.another point i didn't like was on opening night. if i were lily i would be furious with john but she isn't...it just doesn't make sense.but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect.

this film was excellent, i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. this one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)

this is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "party on the left is now party on the right." like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty. it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government. kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge, where the us government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, threw around words like "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights, with the willing acquiescence of the general populace. that message is so non-pc, i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick, katherine prudhomme, the western journalism center, and countless others who dared to speak out. "live free or die" is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays "the voice," and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film.

i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version. i found the 1971 version quite boring. if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as i did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. of course, this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. however, i have seen many remakes, where i have liked the original and older one better. i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. in my opinion, i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so "blase".(boring)

sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say breakdown. he's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. the chases were very good, the part with him beingcornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. this is better than bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law, few movies had the effects-night vision, cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset. the ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not.

its not as good as the first movie,but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes,on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife,the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion,

sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film, and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a tv movie! despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. however, it was nice to see tucson, arizona prominently featured in the film.

spoilers through: i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie. it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original.something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus, have little to compare it to. this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.there were a few things i liked about it. one was the casting of kowalkski. viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. this was a great role for him.another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television. i had no idea this was the case when watching it. it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.i also found the story to be very absorbing. i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this. plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every which way you turned. (i didn't even recognize priestly.) and it was touching. this was not a great movie but it is watchable.and then there's the ending. it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. i am not sure how i feel about the ending. the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which i don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie. admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. however, having said that, i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because, though i have not seen the original, i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results. (my big dislike is actually sequels.) but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.people have compared this to smoky and the bandit. how about a road version of "legends of the fall" meets "thelma and louese" as well? i sure felt touches of both films(both of which i'm a fan of.) i do not think however, that this was a great film. it was better then average to me but far from great. but it was an absorbing, adrenalin fueled, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. my vote is 7 of 10.

i have to say, i loved vanishing point. i've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why i gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.as for the car, well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (and if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged hemi, so it's possible. for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.

to start off with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski, it helps.isn't this just like the united states government though, to terrorize one of its own citizens. sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie! but it is the truth, the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife. a wife, who is in labor no less, and may not make it."there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." the words of the disc jockey.there were some great shots of scenery in this film, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. after much consideration, i gave this film a 7.

any movie that shows federal pigs (persons in government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it. thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.now, though, i don't remember why.i believe the two should not be compared or even connected.consider them as two different movies.rate them as two different movies.this "vanishing point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government."the voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire: "live free or die." at one time it would have been the motto of most americans.despite its obvious flaws, "vanishing point" is a film to cheer.
