ok, let's get this clear. i'm really not into sci-fi, but for some reason i love stargate sg-1. jack o'neil takes his team sg-1 through a stargate. a round device that creates a wormhole. it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. it might sound like your usual sci-fi-series, but it's not! the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series. i find that great. it gives you things, happenings and such you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets. they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there's not many. the series has a nice blending of action, humor and drama. if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here. they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects.

i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons. sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more. atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons. and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it !!!!! 10/10

fact: stargate sg-1 is a cheesy sci-fi tv series.there's no escaping facts. how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi tv series.stargate sg-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly. special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair. or couch for that matter either.but, and this is where i really think stargate sg-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode.in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies.and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg-1 special.i am very picky with my selections. i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught.so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show, don't. stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about.

i love this show!every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is. i am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science (fiction?) show in the history of film/tv. there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion. its amazing, season after season the show gets better and better.i've been a fan of macgyver since i was 5 (19 now) and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson. its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.back when i first saw stargate the movie, i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited, but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over.though, i'm disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead. id say though that it turned out just fine. maybe even better.this show is amazing, and i hope it never dies. atlantis here we come!

i love jack's jokes like 'the cliché is...' or "over the top cliché guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky...". he is just hilarious! daniel's starting to catch up on him to! good thing jack's not on the team anymore (in a way) or else it would have been sarcasm mania!!!!i just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, i have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, i'm starting to pick up facial expressions (and more) from jack, daniel and teal'c...it just all theoretically possible and exciting...oops! their i go again!!! sorry, i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter, and all of this is driving my parents nutz!!!!!!! well, to conclude, i think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so forth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie "stargate." i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject. the show gets it rolling from the very first episode, a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion, dr. daniel jackson. through the first two episodes, we meet samantha carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is teal'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. the main bad guys are called the gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a "system lord." the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa, who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person's brain.through the episodes, we mostly get to see sg-1, the exploratory team comprised of jack/daniel/teal'c/and sam, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. some episodes are on-world, meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth.through the years, you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit, and more character-building story lines. this, in turn means even more on-world episodes, which is perfectly understandable.my rating: 8.75/10----while most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years. but still, top notch science fiction!

stargate sg-1 follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate. in the stargate universe, humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa'uld such as ra and apophis. for millennia, the goa'uld harvested humanity, heavily influencing and spreading human cultures. as a result, earth cultures such as those of the aztecs, mayans, britons, the norse, mongols, greeks, and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy. many well-known mythical locations such as avalon, camelot, and atlantis are found, or have at one time existed.presently, the earth stargate (found at a dig site near giza in 1928) is housed in a top-secret u.s. military base known as the sgc (stargate command) underneath cheyenne mountain. col. jack o'neill (anderson), dr. daniel jackson (shanks), capt. samantha carter (tapping) and teal'c (judge) compose the original sg-1 team (a few characters join and/or leave the team in later seasons). along with 24 other sg teams, they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa'uld, in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races.the parasitic goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. throughout the first eight seasons, the goa'uld are the primary antagonists. they are a race of highly intelligent, ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species, including humans. the original arch-enemy from this race was the system lord apophis (peter williams). other system lords, such as baal and anubis, play pivotal roles in the later seasons. in the ninth season a new villain emerges, the ori. the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy, also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship. the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori, their followers, and their enemiesthe ancients.

it's amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early nineties, a whole franchise can grow. 'stargate; sg1' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi.following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate', this series sees stargate command (a military/science organisation) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. sg1 is one such team, headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill, and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson, military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye. michael shanks, as daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed. amanda tapping, as carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist. christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson). guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers. sg1 also excels in humour, from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death. it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show, overall.

i wait for each new episode, each re-run with anticipation! the new look of sci-fi created by stargate sg-1 is a wonder that i hope will never end. to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. season #9 should be a thrill in itself. i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season, as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill. the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. you cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. also, you need a bigger role for the asgard - they are just too cool.

i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it! her inclusion as the silly 'vela' has brought the series down in my estimation. to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake.unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'jack' and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'farscape'.i was a great fan of the film "stargate" and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film, but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked. i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation

i started watching the show from the first season, and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it. original movie was kind of childish, and i was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the bsg new season.but after few episodes i became a fan. i've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill, the not-only-smart samantha carter, the glorious teal'c, women and kids favorite, and brilliant dr. daniel jackson.of course, stories sometimes not serious, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend, even risking your life for him. it's about "we don't leave anybody behind". struggling to the end when all hope is lost. about the free will, and all good qualities that makes a human - human.and now it's breaking a record, going 10th season, and still doing good.

the movie was sub-par, but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci-fi fans ideal program. the actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. having an intelligent interesting script doesn't hurt either.stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs.

on sunday july 27, 1997, the first episode of a new science fiction series called "stargate sg-1" was broadcast on showtime. a spin-off of and sequel to the 1994 film "stargate" starring kurt russell and james spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. for ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as sg-1. originally, the series starred richard dean anderson as colonel jack o'neill (two "l"s!), michael shanks as dr. daniel jackson, amanda tapping as captain samantha carter, christopher judge as teal'c and don s. davis as major general george s. hammond. for ten long years, we watched the team battle against the goa'uld, the replicators, the ori and many other aggressors. at the same time, they forged alliances with the asgard, the tok'ra, the rebel jaffa, the nox and the tollan. they saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. and sometimes not even then.as with all long-running series, they were numerous cast changes. michael shanks left the series in january 2002 at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. daniel jackson's successor as the team's resident archaeologist/geek was jonas quinn, an alien from a country called kelowna on the planet langara, played by corin nemec. however, shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in june 2003 and nemec left at the same time. unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. don s. davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in march 2004 as he felt that it was time for him to go. the show's original star and arguably its most popular actor, richard dean anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. his participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. he finally left "sg-1" in march 2005 in order to spend more time with his then six-year-old daughter. jack o'neill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, i never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as i did the earlier episodes for that very reason.the ninth season represented a new era for the programme. with the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the goa'uld and the replicators in season eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the ori replacing the goa'uld as the series' main adversaries. three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this re-invention. ben browder came in as the cocky southern air force pilot lt. colonel cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1. his "farscape" co-star, the lovely claudia black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted vala mal doran, a former goa'uld host and con artist from another planet. a recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. rounding off the cast was the legendary beau bridges as major general hank landry, the new commander of the sgc and an old friend of jack o'neill and general hammond. for the last two years, they starred alongside the "sg-1" faithful (michael shanks, amanda tapping and christopher judge) and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the stargate franchise.alas, all good things must come to an end. during the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of season ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its august 2006. after ten seasons and 214 episodes, the dream was finally over. on march 13, 2007, what began with "children of the gods" ended with "unending". the series finale made its world premiere on sky one in britain and ireland before being shown on the sci-fi channel in the united states on june 22, 2007.in the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, "star trek", in terms of popularity in certain countries. it became the second-longest running sci-fi series in the world, second only to "doctor who" (1963-1989), and the longest-running american produced sci-fi series, having surpassed "the x-files" only a few months before it ended."stargate sg-1" represents the cornerstone of the "stargate" franchise. in 2004, its success and popularity led to the production of a spin-off series entitled "stargate atlantis", which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and 100 episodes in august 2008. although plans for another feature film fell through, two direct-to-dvd films, "stargate: the ark of truth" and "stargate continuum", were released in 2008 and more are planned for the not too distant future. a third live-action series, "stargate universe", is also due to premiere at some point next year. (there was, unfortunately, an animated series, "stargate infinity", which ran only from 2002 to 2003 but the less said about that the better). despite the end of "sg-1" and "atlantis" as continuing series, the future of "stargate" looks very bright indeed.in conclusion, while "stargate" has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major sci-fi television franchises such as "star trek" and "doctor who", its still relatively new compared to those two sci-fi giants and i have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.

as a kid, i loved this game. i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew. i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. then streets of rage 2 came out. and we quickly forgot that this one even existed.you play as ex-cops axel stone, adam or blaze fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. there are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x. beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. level 4 (the bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. you even have the chance to become mr. x's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). this leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr. x, but never mind.streets of rage also has truly fantastic music. the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis. the main theme, level one, level 4 and final boss are standout tunes. as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console. but with streets of rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.pros:average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.great tunes.easy to get into and hard to put down.cons:vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2.poor enemy ai. baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss.lack of combo moves.lack of decent weapons.bad guy models are repeated far too often.graphics b- sound a- gameplay b- lasting appeal b-

"stargate sg-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg-1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.having seen this series sporadically for it's first few seasons when it first came out, i didn't know how good this series would really be, 10 years after i had last seen an episode. my old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. "stargate sg-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. and why? because it runs on an amazing premise.this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn't work on the time restriction of film. the sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it's all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show."stargate sg-1" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: - the first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul'd threat. - from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul'd and preventing attacks on earth. after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of goaul'd/replicator/ori conflicts- the 8th season is probably the most mixed one. it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. - the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o'neil. they are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than sg-1 and human/jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori.basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling i have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.in the end, because of the fact that i enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find that it ends. the big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg-1.

the first and second seasons started off shakily, with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones, and at times resorting to clichéd stories. but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more, it became a lot more fun and entertaining. the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men: richard dean anderson, peter deluise, joseph malozzie and paul mullie. richard's dry sense of humour makes to show so much better, peter's directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining, and joe & paul never fail to make a funny, interesting episode together. once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, i doubt you won't like the show. for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other side', a good serious episode, and 'window of opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.

stargate is the best show ever. all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles. i love the connection between the characters. if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it. although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different. i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks. unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time (which is highly depressing). however this program is very very good and is a must see, but be warned it is highly addictive. so in summery i love stargate (and amanda tapping).

i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this film,as it's obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it, or were stupid enough to pay to see it.the best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back. elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can.it's an ok monster flick, compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made. way better!!!!

i was around 7 when i saw this movie first. it wasn't so special then,but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun,a lot:)i think the best parts of the film are: yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also.if you wanna watch this movie ,don't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster,even this film was made from approx. 1000 dollars :) i've a copy of it.movie and video version as well(but i don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas)watch it,enjoy it!!!yeti for ever!!!

most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm. not so this gloriously bent, batty and berserk over-the-top italian-made shot-in-canada kitsch gut-buster: it's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked "what the hell's going on?" crackpot excess and inanity.a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70's disco stud (complete with jumbo wavy afro) perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice. they dethaw the beast, jolt him back to life with electric charges, grossly mistreat him, and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth. before you can say "hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'king kong'," our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen (the gorgeous pheonix grant) he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love. the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience. of course, he breaks free again, nabs the vixen, and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.the sublimely stupid dialogue (sample line: "philosophy has no place in science, professor"), cheesy (far from) special effects (the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw-dropping awfulness), clunky (mis)direction, and a heavy-handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere "is the yeti a man or a beast?" ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen. better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew: the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti's nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth (!); the vixen nurses the yeti's wounded hand while he makes goo-goo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a man's neck with his toes (!!). overall, this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should-be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.

being a giant monster fan, me seeing "yeti" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market i was able to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare i say, decent.decent for what it is, actually, namely a cheesy giant-monster flick. it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately, and we get introduced to various characters. they consist of some sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film, by far.yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original woodstock concert, and really, he's not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he doesn't even rampage (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely (my copy was dubbed in english) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are.however, we want to see the giant yeti do his thing, and he's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the "fake legs" shots of him just standing there.yes, the special effects aren't the greatest, but there are definitely some good ones here. a scene where yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as "ladder steps" to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much, much better than it should in such a "bad" movie."yeti" never stoops as low as say, "a.p.e." does. actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes yeti's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an "oh yeah baby" manner. but even this isn't that bad, and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer.the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring - the story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy."yeti" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other king kong '76 rip-offs like "a.p.e." and "queen kong" by very far.

yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made. i saw it at a midnight screening in l.a. and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does! the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes, there is a mute boy (who sorta kinda looks like a girl) and he's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents (hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid??). then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti (once he thaws - which takes forever) -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes "bedroom eyes" at her - it's like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie. in fact, once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the yeti's nipple and yes, the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard!!!! yikes of all yikes! plus there's a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie - there's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl's hair "gee, thanks yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout. you're the best." this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up. if you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out.

this show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years. i will sadly miss it. although atlantis has filled the hole a small bit.the last ever episode of sg1(on television anyway)was beautifully done. robert wrote something that felt close to reality. as though he was trying to explain what it was like on the set of the show. (everyone working closely together for such a long time there are bound to up's and downs. but over the years they've turned into a family). i thought this was a wonderful way to end despite anyone else's criticisms.sg1 was something special and time and time again it took me across thresholds of disbelief and amazement. the wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. from episode one i was hooked. the blend of action, science, drama and especially comedy worked so well that made me keep wanting more.there are no real words in which to completely express what this show meant to me. i can only thank those who kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. it has inspired me to do many things that i thought was impossible.i look forward to the movies next year and i really hope there will be a number of them. i never want the show to die.stargate sg1 - 1997 - 2007?

people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs- congo, king kong vs. godzilla, king kong (1976), they all ripoff one another, but yeti stands on its own. it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal's attraction with one female.the yeti myth is based on bigfoot (not like king kong)and archeologists have been fascinated it, at one time they did exist,but there is no scientific data to prove it.this movie is hard to find ,but its worth watching it. the first time i watched it was on "elvira's mistress of the dark shows" in the early 1980's. it sent chills down my spine as a kid, especially when the yeti got mad. i saw it again, around 1:00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago. seeing it again made me appreciate it more, it has some overall good effects (for its time) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog, and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes. also the music is pretty cool,its very yeti like. :-)gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere.vote 7 and half out of 10.

here's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite, fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity. this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness, but successfully predicted much of peter jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name, as far as a "romance" between the giant (here a yeti) and a gorgeous human female (antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi's city of the living dead, who is very easy on the eyes).the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package, the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness. but as a trade-off you do get a wacky old scientist, two inquisitive kids, tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain, a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure (dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while) and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti, who turns out to be the good guy, glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands, a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot, some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison, crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either spanish, italian or canadian extras depending upon scene (you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed), and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie.it's here that the film won me over: it's enthusiasm just for being made. frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and god's gun the year before this & was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work. i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with, and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families. the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless. or rather they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked -- which is exactly why peter jackson's movie sucked. he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators, and with all it's faults + clunkiness, kramer's yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space. i'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it! curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever. because the movie looks so "fake" you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked, trampled, tossed about and smashed. knowing that and armed with a fertile, energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie, parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend. this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid.10/10, it's about ten minutes too long but who cares, you only come around once and i'd rather go out with a smile on my face.

having seen most of ringo lam's films, i can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters. the action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable. sadly, burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on, even if you near the second biggest china-town in north america (like i do). if you can find it, don't pass it up.

i have always been keen on watching hong kong movies, but all of them failed to meet my expectations...until now! burning paradise doesn't contain the flat humor most hk movies have, nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film. the story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some "intelligent" space (the only truely intelligent martial arts film i have seen is crouching tiger, but since hollywood is involved it is no true hk movie for me). there are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one(which is one of the coolest i have ever seen, yet so short) to the last main scenes! but mind, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). the production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical (notice: the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall!). yep, it's not tsui hark or john woo that made my favorite hong kong film, it's ringo lam! and i'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director! ace.

"burning paradise" is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam's urban cynicism. when one watches the film, they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. this great film has both!! always trying to be different than his contemporaries, lam gives us to traditional heroes(fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan)and puts them in a "raiders of the lost ark" setting. however, these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie. instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results. what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime, there is no holding back. too bad, they don't make films like this more often.

an unusual film from ringo lam and one that's strangely under-appreciated. the mix of fantasy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven thru bodies is startling especially during the first ten minutes. a horseback rider get chopped in two and his waist and legs keep riding the horse. several horses get chopped up. it's very unexpected.the story is very simple, fong and his shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed maniac general and imprisoned in the red lotus temple which seems to be more of a torture chamber then a temple. the general has a similarity to kurtz in apocalypse now as he spouts warped philosophy and makes frightening paintings with human blood. the production is very impressive and the setting is bleak. blood is everywhere. the action is very well done and mostly coherent unlike many hk action scenes from the time. sometimes the movie veers into absurdity or the effects are cheesy but it's never bad enough to ruin the film. find this one, it's one of the best hk kung fu films from the early nineties. just remember it's not child friendly.

hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones. the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes. where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure. sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood.

this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong's 'new wave' that began with tsui hark's "zu: warriors of magic mountain". tsui set a tone for the new wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave (jackie chan, sammo hung, wong jing, ching siu tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. "burning paradise" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.it's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. but this is just as humans are, not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time.when irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of red lotus temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. he is the very incarnation of milton's satan from "paradise lost": "better to rule in hell than serve in heaven!" and if he can't get to satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.that's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: it's not that the abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. thus there's a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (if you want to know how, see the film!) yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.

people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no exception. some movies i love did poorly at the box office but, i'm glad to say, this movie isn't one of them (over nine million dollars, which i don't think was bad for back then). the characters were fun, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie. i didn't think professor screw eyes or his "scary cirus" was too scary for little kids (the targeted audience for this movie), but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids' movie. overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years.

i disagree with anyone who done't like this movie. i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do. it's sweet, funny and warms your heart. and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. and even though it didn't have much of a story, it was still excellent i give it a 10 and two thumbs up. oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wish's and dreams can come true. (tear, tear)i love this movie, personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say "shame on you." because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it.

i haven't always been a fan, but the show grew on me. it wasn't until after season 5 that i started to see the richness of the show. they finally brought daniel jackson's search for his wife to an end and finally most of the go,ould system lords were killed by rival lords, sg-1 or others.towards season 5, stargate sg-1, was beginning to become stale. with the new writers and the close attention by produer peter deleuise, the show became more and more solid.the characters had become stale as well. colonel jack o'neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. after his son charlie was killed in a shooting accident with o'neill's weapon, he had decided to end his own life by going to abydos in order to face off with the go'ould ra. the character offers little growth for any actor and actor richard dean anderson chose to play him straight raising emotional barriers to protect himself. only allowing his close friends in.amanda tapping joined the cast as captain samantha carter. she was a feminist on the edge, ready to battle any man who would doubt her ability to do her job. though this character had little area to grow, tapping has done a great job of concentrating on carter's strengths. she has taken the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things carter talks about in order that she can present the character intelligently. christopher judge joined the cast playing the alien teal'c. teal'c was an alien called the jaffa. infant go'ould, (snake like creatures) would embed themselves into the jaffa until they had grown to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. the jaffa would die. teal'c was the first prime of apophis' army. knowing that apophis was not a god like go'ould pretend, he realized the genocide that their armies had wreaked on the galaxy. finally, having had enough, he and jack o'neill freed their team along with quite a few innocent people. after arriving on earth, he realized that earth was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight the go'ould. christopher judge has done quite a bit with a limited character. teal'c is a wise warrior, much of which he learned was from his teacher master bra'tac. the show would not be complete without master bra'tac played by tony amandola. he is also a rock. in the end, he became adviser to most of sg-1, especially daniel jackson. don s. davil was there from the beginning playing major general george hammand. davis has done an incredible job with hammond making him sympathetic and normal. he does his job, has a wife, sons and daughters and grandchildren. you can really say, he is the anchor of the base. simply, i would die for that man. if not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world. he will go himself. he doesn't leave anyone behind.i saved dr. daniel jackson for last, because this character, i believe has grown the most in the ten or eleven years it has been on. in choosing shanks i don't think the producer realized how strong shanks would be and now when people talk about jackson, they don't talk about spader, they talk about shanks. in the early years, the jackson character came off as a whiner. that's why i probably wasn't a fan. as the seasons pasted, the character became stronger. this gave him confidence. in the end, as of season 10, the jackson character has matured to the point that he has become a self sacrificing hero. he still monitors the groups ethics. he still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward. acheaology, history, culture and exploration are part of his very being. he is determined. though a man of peace, he has matured to the point that using his weapons may be the only way to solve a disagreement. other characters include, most recently: vala mal doran(claudia black) and colonel cameron mitchell(ben browder), new lead of sg-1. both actors come from a series called farscape and why they were put together is any bodies guess. i see little difference between mitchell and crichton (farscape character). black's character is simply off the wall. definitely different from her soldier like character arin soon.

genre: dinosaur, animation, new york, time travel, circus.?main characters: rex the tyrannosaurus rex, elsa the pterodactyl, dweeb the parasarolophus, ooo the triceratops, a boy called louis, a girl called cecilia and captain new-eyes. ? actors: john goodman (rex), yeardley smith (cecilia), martin short (stubbs the clown), felicity kendal (elsa) etc.?what happens: four dinosaurs (see above) are fed some "brain grain cereal" and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children. they go into new york, with big plansmy thoughts: this is a cute animated film. the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good, but they look pleasant all the same that way. i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. i like (almost) all the characters featured, especially elsa and cecilia, but of course i like the others as well. overall, i like this film a lot! :-)recommended to: people who like good children's animated films, people who like dinosaurs, john goodman and people who think that circuses aren't always what they seem enjoy! :-)

i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart, but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. it doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. none of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. i will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. the music by james horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. i really liked the characters, louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells screweyes "i quit!" had me in stitches. my favourite is screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent. if anything though, i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. the script, while not oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. the voice acting for me was what made the movie. john goodman, martin short, rhea perlman, felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable. all in all, this is a good movie. i don't get the rating, honestly i don't. sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 bethany cox

i saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time... what stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have, where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal, that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say. this is what i like the most about the movie i guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through... they don't break up and make up, they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on.these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different. loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. anyway, i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again... sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no, woog and dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality.now, what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness. little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr. screweyes. and, the addition of him halfway through the movie (though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance) is too abrupt... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie, perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs. i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half.considering the target audience, who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues... i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too, and just enjoy the story. it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think.

its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids (if they like dinosaurs that is) i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any

i wouldn't call "we're back! a dinosaur's story" simply a kiddie version of "jurassic park". i found it more interesting than that. like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. but it really opens my eyes when i see who provided the voices: john goodman, rhea perlman, jay leno, walter cronkite, julia child, kenneth mars, yeardley smith, martin short and larry king. to paraphrase that: a given actor, the "cheers" woman, the "tonight show" host, the most trusted name in news, a famous chef, the "young frankenstein" police chief, lisa simpson, one of the three amigos and the cnn guy.but i guess that i shouldn't focus only on the cast. i thought that this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). true, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. i would actually say that john goodman doing rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in "monsters inc". worth seeing.

this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young, it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies... lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and a few great songs (and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs, but ones that are atually entertaining)! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever! i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie, and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations! sorry not the most informative, i'm in kinda a rush... just please, trust me. all who go against this movie are killing their inner child!

my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh, creative and addicting. when the cast stepped through the gate, you never knew what lay on the other side! starting around season 5, the show took a different focus - still good, but different.the series follows the adventures of a team of humans (and one alien) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the "stargate". the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt.the episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own. what happens next was always unpredictable.the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed. their tone is serious, but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor. they are simply fun to watch.starting somewhere around season 5, the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe (the goa'uld, then the ori). the plots become more complex (a lot more political/strategic oriented) and interdependent. the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature.one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes. they are simply can't-miss shows. they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons.if you are a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll likely be hooked. if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to.

i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. richard dean anderson 2. amanda tapping. these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. this relationship carries over into the program we get to see.rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality. he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface. they manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill'. yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. he understands what to do without having to think about the matter. the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show. he had his rare moments with claudia black, but that was all. amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. she was probably thinking more about the child than the show.the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. the villains (wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi. the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. in the season 2 opener, 'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc, yet it is never mentioned again. this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel', 'o'neill', and 'dr. frasier'.

i'm not great at writing reviews, so i'll just spout my opinions...i loved this series at first. the adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama... i thought it was all brilliant. anderson, tapping, shanks, judge, davis... i loved them all. davis, it seemed, was the fifth-most important person in the cast. not a big deal. but when his character (general hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and anderson's character (colonel o'neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. i don't know whether it's because hammond was more important that i realized or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****.the first seven seasons, though, were awesome. the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it, but it turned out to be, even if this wasn't the original intention, a brilliant setup to the series. i recommend that you watch the movie first, then watch the first season of the tv series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around, believe me), and then watch the rest of the tv series.the last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean they aren't good. it just means they're a letdown if you've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons.after you have finished this series, be sure to watch the spin off series, stargate: atlantis. it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.edit on 7-18-08: i just found out that don s. davis died a few weeks ago. it is a great loss.

i have to say, from the beginning, when i watched the stargate movie movie i wasn't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie, with a lot of potential, though the movie wasn't as, erm, amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens, which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing, even though i'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people, i don't remember one line from either of those movies, i'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts, in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you, ah getting slightly off the point here, well my point is that the that you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series, which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end, in 2006.though i didn't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997, and let me tell you, the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series, the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects, were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today. i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it wasn't for stargate, and my dad, who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6, and i'm glad he did, other wise i wouldn't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1, which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies, basically if a new sci fi series isn't better or as good as sg1, its not worth watching. basically this is the best sci fi show to date, and if you don't watch this, then you have no idea what you are missing!

i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10! the final episode of the 10th season "unending", where (it would certainly appear that) the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! from the extremely rushed end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves!unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.

i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. if you look at the original star trek and star trek:tng, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. in many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. this was less the case with deep space 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other trek shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1. the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. sure, there were a few "throwaway" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.and speaking of funny, i loved that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. in this way, i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5. jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.to truly appreciate sg-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power. and, if you don't like sg-1 after giving it a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you.

this series is set a year after the mission to abydos in the movie stargate. it explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. such as, how was the stargate activated without a human computer? where did the goa'uld (ra's race) come from? how many are there? the first episode has a retired jack o'neill (spelled with 2 ls) recalled to active duty by general george hammond due to an attack by the shut down stargate from apophis, a powerful goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. we meet samantha carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. we find out that daniel got married on abydos, and that there are hundreds of gate addresses that they can dial. then daniel's wife gets captured by apophis and becomes his new queen. it continues in the second episode where general hammond announces the formation of the sgc which includes nine teams, in which jack's team will be sg-1 which consists of jack, samantha and daniel. they go to chulak, a goa'uld homeworld to rescue daniel's wife and another one captured at abydos named ska'ra. they get captured, and just as apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a jaffa named teal'c, first prime of apophis, saves them and goes to earth with them, where he is made part of sg-1. that was only the beginning of the adventure. in the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of goa'uld called the tok'ra, in which samantha's dad becomes a member, the asgard, a cute little race in which we see thor most often (he's jack's buddy),and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.the show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. in season nine, a new enemy called the ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the stargate and its creators, the ancients. season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, ben browder as cameron mitchell, the new leader of sg-1 and claudia black as vala maldoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love interest between samantha and jack, this one has it all. a different way of travelling the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, this is one show you don't want to miss. unlock the gate and step through. you won't regret it!

you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies, even the really bad ones? why? to see their heroes in action one more time. that's the way i feel about doc savage. i am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. there's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) but the spirit of doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to. so, in my long-winded way, what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. and anyone who is a fan of superman, james bond, indiana jones, buckaroo banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.

it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression. it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball.likewise, an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema. the presence of a radio in just about everyone's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world's events and provided many a drama and (especially) comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality.the literature of the time also flourished at all levels. the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it, what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. but the comic book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. there were mediums that were ancestral to them. obviously,the newspaper comic strip was one parent, providing the visual/narrative method of story telling.the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine. the inexpensive, prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going, though not necessarily serialized, tales. the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough's tarzan and johnston mcculley's zorro. the 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow, the avenger, g8's battle aces and the spider,master of men all found their way to the news stands, among many others.one other was doc savage, a full-blooded super hero of the written story; the covers of the pulps had perhaps, the only "picture" of the hero. possessing extraordinary strength, super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect, doc was the prototype super hero.he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. each of them was an expert in a given field. so we had a top rated: chemist, lawyer, construction engineer, electrical engineer, geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist, etc.the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's, and were published into the middle '50's. then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new "container", the paperback book. a fresh look to the cover art was introduced, featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc, with a perpetually ripped shirt.the re-introduction proved to be highly successful, with the publication of a title a month (and for a while more). soon, there was a rumor of a doc savage movie! but when, by what producer? well, the venerable "man of bronze" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films, geoprge pal, who did the film along with warner brothers.when doc savage, man of bronze arrived in the movie houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely "no name" as far familiarity with the viewers. with former tarzan of tv,ron ely's nearly perfect casting in the lead, up and coming beauty of a starlette, pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler (as the villainous, captain seas); no other name would have been recognized. and, just maybe that was a plus in this case.the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going. use of narration, by paul frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story.from the very start, there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured "camp" humor as the batman tv series. some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (for example, an experiment of doc's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish, a small one at that.) the whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little 'camp' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. we are also puzzled about mr. george pal's being the producer(his last). he who had been so well known for special effects, surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character's world.i can remember seeing it quite vividly. mrs. ryan (deanna) was in the hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, michelle(08/14/75). our older girl, jennifer, was visiting her grandmother, so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward, it was straight over to the old marquette theatre, 63rd & kedzie, here in chicago.having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc, i was sort of let down by the final product. i could accept a little of this 'camp' business, but would not have objected if mr.pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement.and yet, the cast, headed-up by mr. ely and the others, made the whole film likable, if not lovable. the sets and locations were, as far as we can see, very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone.and maybe that's just what they were trying for with this doc savage, man of bronze.

having read many of the other reviews for this film on the imdb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. upon this point i cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. however, what i can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!ok..so i must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's batman series does not remain faithful to the original dc comic book character? or perhaps is there still unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of flash gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?the point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!former tarzan, ron ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to gary busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite michael berryman.best scene? far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein savage tackles his nemesis captain seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  priceless!simply put, the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the john phillip sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)

***possible spoilers***i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences. ron ely is just right as doc. cool, calm, almost always in control(and with an occasional twinkle in his eye). what more can one ask for? i have never read a doc savage book, so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. many people have compared this movie to raiders of the lost ark, which i don't think is fair. the difference in budget is astounding(raiders must have at least 10 times the budget). doc savage does not have the extensive location work that raiders has. special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right. the sousa music is catchy(love that theme song- every time i watch the film, i end up humming the theme for days).the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy. highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the rooftops of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain seas. not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib (really!). overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day. i give it 7 out of 10.doc savage, doc savage...thank the lord he's here!

most people miss hollywood's point of concept. if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the confines of the law then i, approve of the lessons being taught by doc savage.in all times of conflict or war, the public and government look for heroes to decorate. the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as doc savage, james bond, superman, batman, spiderman and others. doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the 'best of the best' before james bond, superman or any of the others. all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character, not the 'man of bronze'.

the problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as "camp" (i.e., the 60's batman show) for tv and movie. thus you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), a cluelessly unromantic doc savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot), monk mayfair in a nightsheet (a scene guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights), and the totally hokey ending with the secondary bad guy encased in gold like a herve villechez posing for an oscar statute. and when they're not doing booming sousa march scores, the tinkly little "funny" music undercuts much of the drama.even as such, this movie is...okay. it's fun, and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. except for monk, as has been mentioned before: he's hugely muscled, not obese. and long tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not paul gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf.the green death sequences, for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something i'd recommend for children. but they are very close to the feel of the pulps. when the writers and producers get it right, they do get it right - i'll give them that.but if the producers had done doc with the loving care and scripting of, say, reeves' first two superman movies, think what we might have had then. i think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. there's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give in to the "heroes must be camp" attitude that batman created. one gets the impression there was a sober, pulp-style first draft and then someone came in and said, "hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the batman show 8 years ago!"but doc lives on, thanks to earl macrauch and buckaroo banzai. if macrauch ain't doing a homage to doc savage in that movie, the man is truly demented. so when the series actually gets on tv (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), doc savage, updated to the 90's, will live once more.

this is a very entertaining movie. a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who, apparently, think that the film was an effort at serious drama. it was not made that way....it is an extremely enjoyable film, performed in a tongue in cheek manner. all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us. the fight sequences are lively, brisk and, above all, not gratuitous. the so-called "green death", utilized on a couple of occasions, is not, as i read in one review, "gruesome". a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film. hey, lighten up... again, i remind one and all that this is a fun film. each phase of this "fight" was captioned, which added to the fun aspect. the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan. this is not one of those martial arts films. ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc. another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the "bad guy" (seas) is dealt with. i promise you that if you don't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value, you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner.

outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as "raiders of the lost ark", only done on a low budget and much campier by director michael anderson. the opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating batman by two decades. starring ron ely (tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous pamela hensley as the local latina mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of hidalgo. best line, our hero to mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "mona, you're a brick!"paul wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, captain seas is a an absolute delight. expect a little "raiders..", a dash of "batman", a little "the lost world", a little "lost horizons" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. watch out for cult favorite michael berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of john philip sousa's patriotic music. a prime candidate for dvd release, it is certainly overdue. an unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10

i was brought up on doc savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, i found it thoroughly entertaining.i have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think i'm odd but there you are. "i don't know what it is about the doc, but he always gets the girls" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over austin powers. ron ely is a god.it is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk. i don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like i said it's a classic,it cannot be done without ron.(like the italian job without mini's and michael caine). i give it 10/10.

we so often talk of cinema landmarks - kane, the godfather, a bout de souffle. one film however is too often overlooked by "serious" film critics. i am talking of course about the classic doc savage (m.o.b.)this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism. not to mention kung-fu.it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history (until of course queen's breathtaking work on flash gordon). although a bit of a rarity, this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold.

it's been a while since i've watched this movie, and the series, but now i'm refreshing my memory! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together. bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee. when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm, bo and luke sneak around hogg's local construction site and find samples of coal. they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county, unless the dukes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin, daisy. my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg, and sheriff rosco p. coltrane was way too serious. other than that, i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard!!!

what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. it was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. the movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. all in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd. people, enjoy it for what it is.

having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. reality check: the original series wasn't that good. i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.back to the movie. if you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series, then it's not bad at all. the real star is of course the general lee. the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d.o.h. is all about. johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb-and-dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved. the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy, burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m.c. gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p. coltrane, the way he always should have been.if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect. otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.

i'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show. and i really enjoyed this flick. i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters.it's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like "lame plot" and "it's much cruder than the show." does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.and as far as the plot goes. it was the perfect dukes plot. in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen.while sean william scott and johnny knoxville aren't exactly like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. i wasn't too keen on burt's boss hogg though. and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe. in the movie roscoe is a little... scary.and who didn't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard?folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. it's just a great dumb movie!

i saw this movie when i was a child. it blew me away. this was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude, could send a young kid into orbit. it so impressed me, that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days. the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its' time. sabu was a real delight, as was rex ingram as the genie. i found myself singing "i want to be a sailor" for months after the film left town. i would recommend this movie to any and everyone. i forgot to mention conrad veidt, who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet. also, june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture. the color was outstanding. give this movie an aaa!

next to "star wars" and "the wizard of oz," this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. it's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings, and that it's british, meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film (i'm currently 18), but one must appreciate classic films first. i absolutely adore this film. it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any john williams "star wars" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won oscars), and state-of-the-art oscar-winning special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). and, of course, june duprez's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta-jones' (she even looks like jones in a way!).in conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to "the adventures of robin hood") and it truly deserves more attention. it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with "robin hood," it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.stars: **** (excellent)

it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages--to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful, colorful production, and, to adults, for a literate script, fine production values, good casting/acting, all bound together with a fine rozsa score. two roughly contemporary films accomplish this--"thief of baghdad" (1940) and "the adventures of robin hood" (1938). some of the back story on this production is fascinating. this production, commenced in england in the summer of 1939, moved to hollywood, and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts! the producer, alexander korda, was subsequently knighted in 1942. here is a unique case of the intersection of art, commerce, and politics! by all means, secure a good cd of this film for your library!

this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure. the genii in the bottle is a classic scene. romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be. i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true.

let's cut a long story short. i loved every minute of it. a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style. there's an evil magician, a pretty princess, a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after. modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic. only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated (loved sabu with the djinn's foot, though!)

a magical journey concocted by alexander korda and michael powell. these two titans of the british cinema have mixed some fabulous ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! some of the most ravishing early technicolor, a sublime and shimmering miklos rozsa musical score along with the youthful exuberance of sabu, the theatrical and malevolent villainy of conrad veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of june duprez as the princess all work wonderfully well. miles malleson who plays duprez father, the sultan of basra, also wrote the perfect screenplay which is appropriately grandiose. don't miss this one! since posting the above comments, i have obtained the recently released dvd and can honestly say i'd never seen the picture properly until viewing this dvd version-the clarity and resolution is so precise and the colors are so vivid that i was stunned-this amazing classic can be watched time an again and never fails to charm and delight the viewer. again, a must see!

a fantastic arabian adventure. a former king, ahmad, and his best friend, the thief abu (played by sabu of black narcissus) search for ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, jaffar (conrad veidt). there's hardly a down moment here. it's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. personally, i found ahmad and his princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why john justin, who plays ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). conrad veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra, the father of the princess. he collects amazing toys from around the world. jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together. and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time, willis o'brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.

this was usually producer alexander korda's advice on set to many of his underlings; the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex, zoltan korda and william cameron menzies helped out, pushing it to six.for john kobal's 1987 book, "the top 100 movies", his survey of 81 film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach 55th place. a closer examination reveals only jose luis guarner, john russell taylor and kobal himself actually voted for the picture, but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half-way mark.the outbreak of the second world war saw the movie's production shifted around england and america, eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical oscars. like citizen kane, it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love.the special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually hold up if you squint. but it's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly. there's also a killer toy of the six-armed goddess kali, (perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a quite horrific-looking giant spider. also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. but most memorable has to be rex ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall! ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. and look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle!john justin does well as the arabic king who, for some strange reason, has an english accent and a stiff upper lip. sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year-old, is near-namesake abu, a likeably cocky thief. after they cross paths with the evil jaffer (conrad veidt), justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog. when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed's (justin's) perspective, we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues. in truth, the second half is someway the better, being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature.three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient; i wouldn't classify this as a musical. it's all great fun; justin and june duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, veidt is the boo-hiss villain, and abu is the youthful, irrepressible robber. it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies, but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in. quite commendable.

the making of the thief of bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. alexander korda nearly went broke making this film.according to the citadel film series book about the great british films, adopted son of the united kingdom alexander korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. but world war ii unfortunately caught up with korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.budget costs happen in us films too, only cecil b. demille always had a free hand at paramount after 1932 when he returned there. but demille nor any of his american contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. part of the way through the shoot, korda transported the whole company to america and shot those sequences with rex ingram as the genie in our grand canyon. he certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the uk. korda also finished the interiors in hollywood, all in time for a release on christmas day 1940.the spectacle of the thing earned the thief of bagdad four academy award nominations and three oscars for best color cinematography, best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects. only miklos rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the grand canyon because it's impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.the special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. the good is the two young lovers john justin and june duprez and the evil is conrad veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to duprez. this was veidt's career role until casablanca where he played the luftwaffe major stroesser. of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. beggar boy and thief sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the maharajah of mysore he was spotted by alexander korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the arabian nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.the thief of bagdad holds up remarkably well today. it's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.

although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film. they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. it doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.

this was a favorite of my childhood - i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time. now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own, i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. we watched it last friday, and he liked it. during abu's fight with the giant spider, my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared. "is he gonna beat the spider, poppa?" just watch, you'll see. he has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al-raschid might as well be oz under ozma.i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief, and not the grown-up king. in fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys. it's definitely a period piece - i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then. the love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "why does ahmad love the princess? because the narrative demands it." the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot genies and the temple of the all-seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme. the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking "some fun, and adventure at last!"

probably the finest fantasy film ever made. sumptuous colour, spectacular sets, incredible, spot-on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood. acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands, but here the poetic dialog is deftly, sensitively spoken (the humour is subtle and delightful as well).doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one. along with "the four feathers" (1939), one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films---and one of the finest motion pictures ever made.a true, compelling classic!

words can hardly describe it, so i'll be brief. "the thief of bagdad" was my favorite movie as a child, and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me. i loved this film from the first moment i saw it, when i was a boy of six who had started reading "the arabian nights." i remember walking into the tv room in the middle of sabu's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled.rarely has so much beauty, magic, and wonder been captured on film. sabu and john justin are superb as the dashing heros, conrad veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain jaffar, and rex ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie. georges perinal's photography is some of the best use of technicolor. one of the three credited directors is michael powell, a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films, including "a matter of life and death" (aka "stairway to heaven") and "the red shoes." he is one of the true masters of the camera, right up there with david lean, akira kurosawa, and orson welles.as with all great works of art, the beauty of "the thief of bagdad" lies in the detail. every frame has its own magical charm. the story never lags, and the characters and their actions are always involving. here is a film that will never grow old.

i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess. as any kid would be, i was delighted with the imagination, inventiveness and energy of the film. several years later, i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing. i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years. in addition to the script, the production transcends the fantasy genre. this is korda, the storyteller at his very best. when you see thief as a child you know that you`ve had a great time. when you see thief as an adult you know that you`ve seen a masterpiece. it`s as timeless as the story it treats. an amazing work.thomas mccarthy

this is an oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. the malignant vizier jaffar (magnificently played by conrad veidt)with powerful magic faculties imprisons the prince ahamad of bagdad(attractive john justin)who loses his throne, then he escapes thanks a little thief named abu(sympathetic sabu). they arrive basora where ahamad and the princess(gorgeous june duprez) fall in love. but prince and thief are haunted by jaffar , ahamd is turned blind and abu is become a dog. the story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie(overacting performed by rex ingram) who gives three wishes to sabu , the magic eye, the figure of goddess kali with several hands, among others.this remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. produced by london fim's alexander korda and directed by the definitively credited ludwing berger, michael powell and tim whelan with a stunning screenplay by lajos biro and miles malleson also dialogs writer and actor as sultan fond to mechanic games. the wwii outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three korda brothers and collaborators traveled usa continuing there the filming in especial on grand cannon colorado.the splendid visual and glimmer technicolor cinematography , setting and fx provoked the achieving three oscars : production design by william cameron menzies and vincent korda ,cinematography by george perinal and special effects by osmond borradaile though today are dated and is urgent a necessary remastering because the colors are worn-out. furthermore one nomination for the evocative and oriental musical score by miklos rozsa. this vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs

despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.it was filmed in england (nowhere near morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. at the outbreak of war, everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon.notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - "i want to be a bandit, can't you understand it". it remains a favourite of many people.

this film, was one of my childhood favorites and i must say that, unlike some other films i liked in that period the thief of bagdad has held on to it's quality while i grew up. this is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. the only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the bad' effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. i remembered nothing of those effects, of course it had been about ten years since i'd seen this film, when i was about eleven years old. who then watches effects? one only seeks good stories and entertainment and this is exactly what this film provides. in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. coming to think of it i feel like the indiana jones films are quite a like this film. there is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture that will capture you from the beginning until the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. all of that is mainly due to the great story, the good directing and the good acting performances of the actors. in that department sabu (as abu) and conrad veidt (as jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. great film and although an 'oldie', definitely a goldie'. i hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on dvd someday.8 out of 10

abu, the thief of bagdad, helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer.as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames, sir alexander korda's london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights. replete with swords & sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. it also is a fine piece of film making, featuring good acting and an intelligent script.conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the evil magician jaffar. his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days. here is a villain worth watching. as the boyish thief, sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. while not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed & action.the rest of the cast do fine work. john justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way; sabu gets a significant part of the action (when he's not transformed into a dog) but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra, coveted by two very different men. appearing late in the film, massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude.allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller. miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys (malleson was also responsible for the film's screen play & dialogue). aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend. mary morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed silver dancer.the film was begun in britain, but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california, which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast. the art direction, in vibrant technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites & pinks.*************************born sabu dastagir in 1924, sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore's stables when he was discovered by korda's company and set before the cameras. his first four films (elephant boy-1937, the drum-1938, the thief of bagdad-1940, jungle book-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed. after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, black narcissus (1947) being the one great exception. his final movie, walt disney's a tiger walks (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.

the story-line of "the thief of bagdad" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar's deeds and hate him. he is imprisoned by jaffar, where he meets abu the young thief. the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra. there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by. ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. then he is captured. when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself, ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog. jaffar then asks for the princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra. the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by abu as his dog. the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. he does awaken her. she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad, but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore ahmad's sight and turn abu back into a thief. the princess sees a vision of ahmad; he is in a boat; jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. for freeing him, he gets three wishes. his first is for sausages. in the meanwhile, the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar; but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. abu makes a second wish, to find ahmad. the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all-seeing eye. abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees ahmad in a canyon. he has the genie take him to ahmad. ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. she smells a flower and forgets everything at once. abu wishes they were in bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of ahmad. ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess, but jaffar smashes the 'eye'. abu finds himself in the "land of legend", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save ahmad and the princess. the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess; but when he tries to make abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda. the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director, while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography. the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell, with tim whelan, alexander korda, william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating. the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong, oliver messel and marcel vertes. the production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, i claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar. rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima, and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan. as ahmad, john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. this film has a spaciousness about it that is found, i assert, in other korda works also. its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. this is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.

i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once. the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious: "you sons of a thousand fleas".it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3:00 am once and it had just started. tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.10/10

-the movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince and soon becomes the shadow ruler of baghdad. the jailed prince meets a thief called abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with, but unbeknown to him the evil wizard jafa is also in love with the princess and tries to convince her father to allow him to marry her. jafa soon learns that the prince is trying to win the girls heart so he makes him blind and turns abu into a dog. this leads to the prince and abu going off on an adventure to find a way to defeat jafa, restore peace to baghdad and marry the princess. during their journey they encounter everything from sarcastic genies that takes abu on a flight through the clouds, a giant spider that's really hungry, and a flying horse that probably gives birth to one of the most beautiful sequence these old eyes of mine have ever seen.-this is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do magic instead of just hit people with their staffs. it doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. the production designs are just stunning in this movie. from the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter. even though this movie is over 40 years old, the production design is far better than most of the crap that gets tacked on in today's cinema. the music and songs are also well done. anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, "i want to be a sailor sailing on the seas" as one of the great musical moments in movies. i'm usually not a huge fan of singing in movies since i find them about as enjoyable as doing my taxes but i'll be more than happy to make an exception for this movie.-what sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life which is also the same reason why i love stuff like "two towers" and "silent hill". way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic cgi to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. one of my favorite shots in "two towers" is the one where we see the trolls opening the black gates, the main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor, and that's what i love about the genie and other creatures in the movie. they're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else which gives them a real feel even though they're all just fantasy beings.-it's literally impossible to watch this movie and not notice where the makers of "aladdin" got their inspiration. the characters from this movie are pretty much the same characters in that movie from the talkative genie right down to the flying carpet. it's not an entirely bad thing in my eyes since it's nice to know that i'm not the only one on the planet that has a deep passionate love for this amazing movie. i first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week i still think it's amazing. that's a true testament that a great movie can withstand the test of time. sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. not everything looks outdated though since most of the stuff can still hold its own today when scrutinized under today's standard.-if you ever wanted to see a live action version of "aladdin" then you should get your wish with this but the angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.

the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies. it is exciting without gore, it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. the casting couldn't have been better. rex ingram made me believe in genies. and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar. he set the bar very high...i watch this movie at least twice a year...and never tire of it. this film is an adventure for all ages..no-one too old to enjoy it. the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time...i was ten years old the first time i saw it and the u.s. was just about to enter wwii. conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evilness" a few years later in "casablanca." and korda teamed up,i believe, with justin and dupree again in "the four feathers"....great film-making!

an utterly beautiful film, one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do, in thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time. by the '90's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out, but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. after escaping with a little thief played by sabu, ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures (although apparently not enough for sabu!) and love not only conquers but annihilates everything. the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940, but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later. anyway, if i'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies, flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact, the stunning colours throughout; sabu and rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever, this and casablanca, and then died. john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers, both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted, but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered.there's a couple of mildly violent images in it, but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message, it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. one of my top 10 film favourites, i can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time.

the thief of bagdad is a treasure. first and foremost, it is a good story. though my four children's primary exposure to this tale, the most famous of the stories of the arabian nights, comes from the disney corporation, the thief of bagdad held their interest to the end. the story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability. sabu, who plays the young thief, abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal, judging from the number of times i heard my oldest daughter say, "he's c-u-t-e!" in 1940, the film won oscars for cinematography and special effects. today, of course, those effects seem very dated ("look, it's barbie flying through the air," declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying). yet they fit into the story well. the film is, after all, over 60 years old. the effects fit with the script. furthermore, what ones sees in the thief of bagdad remained pretty much state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years. one need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 star trek episode to see this. in that, it was quite an achievement.this qualifies as a family film, though there are a few stabbings near the end. the acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation.all in all, a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment, or for the historical value of the effects. i recommend it.

i grew up with this as my all-time favorite film. the special effects are incredible for the era, and won awards. i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday. it is simply a great, timeless adventure. the music is by miklos rosza, who is cinema history's best. sabu is the thief. conrad veidt is the grand villain. i have a copy within reach, for the next trip down memory lane. whoa there! rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle!

i first discovered alexander korda's (1940) fantasy, the thief of bagdad in the early 1950's on a re-issue billed as "the wonder show of the century!" both korda technicolor films, the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program. the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films. the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful! the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made. as the years passed, it became more difficult to enjoy the film's color in the way it had originally been presented in. true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950's. both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video. but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor. the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice, but not as it should be. now comes the m-g-m dvd (3 dec 2002) issue. the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning!!! it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once, i watched it a second time. the only "extras" are a spanish dubbed version, sub-titles in both english & spanish, and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer. thank you m-g-m for this exceptional dvd release. now, one can only hope that korda's four feathers and a restored version of korda's jungle book (to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation) will soon follow on dvd.

three flash-backs introduce the main characters (abu, jaffar, and the princess) who will interact with ahmad; three are the songs, each linked to those same characters. three times does ahmad pronounce the absolute word 'time', in his declaration of love to the princess, answering her three questions at their first of three meetings. so strong is the impression he causes, that the princess will resist the three attempts by jaffar to conquer her - by three successive ploys: deceit, hypnosis, and memory erasing. yet, jaffar owns what he describes as the three inescapable instruments of domination over a woman: the whip, the power, and the sword. three is the number of flying entities: the mechanical-horse, the genie, and the the genie and the magic carpet. the genie offers three wishes to abu at their first of three encounters; three times does the genie laugh loud in the mountain gorges, and three are his considerations about human frailty, before he departs. abu overcomes three obstacles in the temple of dawn (armed guards, giant-spider, and giant-octopus). three are the instruments of justice: the magical eye that shows abu the future, the magical carpet that transports him just in time to save ahmad and the princess, and the bow-and-arrow to execute jaffar. there's magic in the number three, and there is magic in this movie.

like the arabian nights this film plays with storytelling conventions in order to make us feel that there's plot, plot and more plot: it opens with what appears to be the frame device of a blind man telling the story of his life, then plunges into a flashback which takes us right up to the blind man's present, where we discover that about half of the story is yet to come. (it must be admitted that the second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first.) like the arabian nights it tries to cram as many middle-eastern folk motiffs as possible into the one work. a freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toys, sea voyages, a crowded marketplace, a wicked vizier, jewels ... i don't know why it all works, but it does. everything is just so beautiful. the sets are beautiful. june duprez is beautiful. rozsa's score is especially beautiful. as usual, it sounds hungarian; but somehow he manages to convince us that he's being hungarian in a persian way.

"the thief of bagdad" is impressive in the shape of the evil magician jaffar (conrad veidt). he plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young king ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father...he falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (sabu).the armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms...the script is poetic, simply and very beautiful... the costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...the radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...for spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...with flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie (excellently played by rex ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of sabu and veidt, "the thief of bagdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the arabian nights... the 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale!

the story of the boy thief of bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924, who starred douglas fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of "thief of bagdad," to less imposing, more recent attempts. the best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. those effects still work their charm.no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief, abu, john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, jaffar, played by a sinister conrad veidt. the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram.ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt. their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: lawrence w. butler and tom howard. (howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. still, i don't think anyone under eight ought to see "thief of bagdad."this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them."thief of bagdad" is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. this is one of the best of its kind.9/10.

it's a bit easy. that's about it.the graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games. the sounds are magnificant. everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic.the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64.i got this game as a christmas present in 1997, and since then, i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.

mario's first foray into the world of 3-dimensions is incredible. miyamoto's masterpiece was reason enough to buy a nintendo 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today. this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure/platform games.

although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games. games with this much replay value are few and far between. plus, this game has so much variety. there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. the game isn't very challenging, but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all. once you beat it, you'll want to erase your game and start again. and its just as much fun the second time, or third time, or two hundredth time. a must own for any nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64.

super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created. it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break. i've beaten the game 4 times, but i've never gotten all 120 stars...(i've gotten 111)...but i hope to achieve them eventually. even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in, i loved watching my sisters play it. now i am 13 and still play this, erasing games and starting over again.the graphics are unbelievable for an early n64 game. the gameplay is addictive. the controls are great. the levels are tough, but not impossible. the bowser fights are challenging.i would like to tell you more, but why don't you just get it for yourself? put the x-box 360, ps3, and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.

one of the funnest mario's i've ever played. the levels are creative, there are fluid controls, and good graphics for its time. there's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still, need to get more accomplished to fight a boss, it can be annoying. another complaint is the camera angle; though it works fairly well most of the time, it can be a pain in certain situations. if your a big time mario fan; this ones for you. even if your not a huge fan of him, i'd still recommend this one. its a big game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good for playing in short bursts of time. it will almost certainly hold your interest; it sure does hold mine!

when i first got my n64 when i was five or six,i fell in love with it,and my first game was super mario 64.and i loved it!the graphics were great for it's time,a good plot,great courses and above all,the best music i heard in a nintendo game.i don't remember the plot completely,but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser,and mario has to rescue her.the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle.each had about five or six challnges to get the stars.there are secert parts of the castle,where you can get more stars.but of course,you have beat bowser.*i think there are three levels to beat bowser on* lets start with the characters.mario is the main character,and gets helpful advice from toad,so he is basically one of your only alliances.i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end.the main villain is bowser,and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba.the characters are really great.next,how about the graphics?people say gameplay is more important then the graphics,and i agree completely.but with he great plot,there are great graphics.especially for it's time.i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don't compare to super mario.bright colors,great effects and awesome sound effects.i found the graphics in the water courses very very good.next to the bowser world ones,it has the best graphics in the game.now,the music.this is my favorite part of the game.growing up,when i played this at a young age,i'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep.especially the music from jolly roger bay,which was peaceful and wonderful.there are others that are great too,especially in,once again,the worlds with bowser,are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites.this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer,and i love it.this game gets 10/10 or *****(5)/*****(5) go play the game!

or at least one of the best. i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64. bowser is up to his usual shenanigans (yeah it's a dumb word but the only one i can think of) and mario must stop him again. this game is very fun to play, and contains lots of nostalgia to me. the only bad thing about it is the graphics, which are awful to today's standards, but everything else is pretty good (especially the little mini-games you can unlock) it's the second best n64 game (the first best is conker's bad fur day) that i recommend to any mario fan, or any fan of platform games. it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day.9/10 or: a

yes, that's right, it is. i firmly believe that the n64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made. it was amazing the first time i saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. the play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there. a must have for any n64 owner, and a reason to get an n64 for everyone else.

rated e i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times.in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day, super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system.i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.if you have an n64 and don't have this game you should try to find it.the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment.the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game.you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer.now you can do it in a 3d environment.super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it.10/10

this game is amazing. really, you should get it if you don't have it. although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. i believe that this game will always be a classic. it's just as good a super mario world or so. when i was young, my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. it's not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy, but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential. it's fun entertaining and challenging. everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) rock on 4eva mario luigi and yoshi!!! nintendo is the best!

mario is invited to princess peach's castle for cake. when mario gets there, he finds out that bowser has kidnapped her! mario must save the day again. unlike the 2-d games, mario can explore anything he wants to. he can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-ups, find secrets in levels, and more. you can spend four hours in one level. no time limits. there are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight bowser at the end of the stage. to get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. you enter the world by going through a painting. there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, i don't see how anyone could dislike this game. it's great. this launch title is the game that insured gamers that the n64 would have a good life. every 3d plat-form game we know of has something in common with sm64. banjo kazooie and banjo tooie are examples that are commonly used. super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games. 10 out of 10. if you have an n64, buy this game. it's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. a perfect 10.

spacecamp is my favorite movie. it is a great story and also inspires others.the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie. it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie.the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up. i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school; i also know a close friend of the late pilot.i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach.i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up. i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers,"invisible", going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result, so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities. i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later, strangely enough, on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour.

spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day. seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator. i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe2 who said that i was young and that is true. holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow "hide daddy". the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time. we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms. i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible. my daughter julia is 23rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer. she already said that she doesn't like bullies. having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys. julia has been growing up fast. the time of jfk and qe2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023. julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon. if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority. president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time. thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors. kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg. wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses. if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer. check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also.

hurrah! a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp. the film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup. but when the going gets tough - the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds.the only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the "i'm right and you're all wrong" instructor. i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote.

this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever!i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish, but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit "like super cool" with a "like totally bitchin" belt and stick on rhinestones on her face.but anyways, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that holds your interest. i know that the begining drags, particuarly if you know what is going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film.i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie, in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself, but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind.

spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can have fun watching as well. growing up in the 80's i enjoyed this movie, it's plot and all the actors. i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own, they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did. the plot is fun, a group of kids, embark on a journey they never expected, when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot. they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in. once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life.

i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. this film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. it was never meant to be 'real' or serious. it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion...i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too! later, i shared it with my daughter and she, too, loved it. spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun. all the 'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp (one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. oh well. if you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, i highly recommend it! enjoy!

this is one of those feel good, saturday afternoon movies. it's right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the navigator. just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. and it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and lea thompson. not to mention joquin phoenix.i personally really like movies like this from time to time. nothing too deep or too scary. just a nice story line. and i would have never known mr. phoenix had i not recently read the credits. he was just a baby really when he made this movie.kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too. she and lea did a wonderful job in this movie. i agree it's not an oscar caliber movie. but very much worth watching. especially if you have kids in the , let's say, 8 to 11 year old range. or ones that are interested in the space program.

space camp is a pretty decent film. the plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time.this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster, and that really put a hamper on how popular it was.the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular... on the big screen, that is... on a tv... it just looks average. i remember this scene in the theater. it made you feel like you were really up there.this would be a good film to see on imax, but i'm sure that will never happen.

to my surprise i quite enjoyed 'spacecamp', i remember seeing it about 13 years ago, and recently i hired it again. i was quite impressed. obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp. however, this film had a story- a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it. but thats what i liked about it- they don't make films like this anymore, so it was a refreshing change. it was interesting to see kelly preston, leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles, with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot. absolutely loved the robot named jinx, it was very cute, but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters. the film was almost inspirational in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama (i think).

this is a family film, which to some people is an automatic turn off. it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book. this film is none of those. it is cliché, it is formula, but it is also fun. it doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality. it simply does what a good film ought to do, which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. the cast is good, while not excellent. as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable. it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster, which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening, but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein. so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.

the perfect space fantasy film. a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down, but do they, sure they do.this would not be a family film if they all died. then it will all be sad. you don't want that kate capsaw, the leading lady gives a golden globe performance, but sadly, she nor lea thompson won one. that sucks so bad.i can't say it enough, this film is so great, lea thompson- o lord, a perfect girl for this film. this film is the best for sure. sorry, but better than star wars. star wars is so over- rated and space camp was so under- rated. it should of been the other way aroundexcellent 10/10- 0r maybe 11/10. iam not good at math

a few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot. and the oxygen in ship was running short. they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks, etc, etc.first of all, this movie's plot is not possible in real life. but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in.it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years. (i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000, it was filmed in 1986) there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood.the view was great from outer space. it does not look unreal. it is about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice. you know that it is not real, but you just get sucked into it until the end.overall, it is a good family movie.

unfortunately, spacecamp came out about the same time as the challenger explosion. which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should, bring it out. i'm glad they did. i first watched spacecamp at a drive-in movie. which really enhanced the viewing a lot.while i had heard of lea thompson and tom skerritt. i had never heard of the others in the movie. so, it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting, and acting real good! of course, kate capshaw was excellent too.i especially liked the scenes, where those kids were being shown how to act, as a team. the scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for. the actual launch of a spacecraft, is of course, old news to us. however, this one was different.all in all, this is one of my most treasured films. escapist maybe, but it was fantastic for a space nut like me. after probably renting it for 30 - 40 times. i finally found it available in a certain store and bought it. now, if it only comes out on dvd. i will probably have it forever. this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.

i notice the dvd version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the frf and the launch. they are to prove they can win the right to sit in the frf other than the green team.another scene is like during their failure at the simulation, kevin gets joaquin to clam down.i think the vhs edition other than the abc one might have all the missing stuff.otherwise i like to know which dvd release has the missing stuff.the dvd i have watched feels edited for television.

i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth, this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory, right?very i liked watching this film when i was the child. i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really, certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense. who at healthy senses, sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit. i very like reading for the subject, american and soviet space programs. i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows?

watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories . i'm 34 now, have not seen it since i was 12-14. i had almost forgotten about this movie, but when i watched it again recently, some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! that little robot "jinx"(friends for ever!). it was just like revisiting my childhood. it was an absolutely amazing experience for me. i will always cherish this movie for that reason. i hope some of you readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular movie, but any movie you have not seen in a long while. very nostalgic...-thanks for reading

it's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr. the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome! the guy is cute too so it's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls.

yowsa! if you really want some action, check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller! veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy-swimsuit scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like! want action? you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor. want babes? you'll get an eyeful every two minutes. want more? go out and buy this video! yowsa, yowsa, yowsa! that's some mighty spicy meatballs!!!

a thin story with many fine shots. eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d.r.e.a.m. team. and, to a lesser extent, the guy accompanying them. traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business-couple intending to poison the world with antrax. original in this movie is the bra-bomb, put on a captured member of the d.r.e.a.m.-team. of course she is rescued by a co-member, three seconds before explosion. although clearly lent from james bond's 'goldfinger' and 'you only live twice', such a climax always works well. all in all a nice watch, james bond replaced here by three charlie's angels.

i enjoyed watching cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see, your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster. i did like watching cliffhanger, i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky.

this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle. stallone is gabe walker. cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie. stallone needed this role to get back on track. snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than finnish man. action is good! music in the film is spectacular. the bad guy is john litghow, other stars micheal rooker ( the portrait of serialkiller), janine turner ( strong medicine). the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie. overall good movie ****/*****remember extreme ääliöt: special collectors edition, with good extras. comig soon in finland straight to video.

good action show, but nothing new. this one took place high in the mountains, which showed some nice scenery and such. one man takes on a group of mercenaries, the lead flies, and he kicks butt. it could have been called "rambo goes to the rockies", it was that pat. it did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror. not a bad picture, but just same ol', same ol'.

this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well,an exciting plot,and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human,much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters.they chose to humanise stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style,weakens the excitement factor.also,the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.the script should have been more realistic and less "talky".another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.instead,they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala "a-team" tv series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.this movie had a lot of all time great potential.crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.i know this was not stallone's fault.i sense the movie's director wanted to tone down stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.sill a good movie though........

this movie is really nerve racking cliffhangin movie!stallone was good as always!michael rooker put on a surprising performance and john lithgow play a excellent villain!the music is fantastic especially the theme!the movie is action packed and never dull!if you are a stallone fan then watch cliffhanger,you won't be disappointed!

cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor. it's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars. it has great action sequence's, edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies.

after the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (michelle joyner). eight months has passed... the rocky mountain rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind eric quaien (john lithgow). quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside. two experienced climbers walker (sylvester stallone) and tucker (micheal rooker) and a helicopter pilot (janine turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by quaien and his men. now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek. while quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped tucker to find the money. once tucker finds the money, tucker will be dead. against explosive firepower, bitter cold and dizzying heights. walker must outwit quaien for survival.directed by renny harlin (driven, mindhunters, a nightmare on elm street 4:the dream master) made an entertaining non-stop action picture. this film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well. this was one of the biggest hits of 1993. this is one of harlin's best film. lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain. stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller. this is probably harlin's best work as a filmmaker.dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has an running commentary track by the director with comments by stallone. dvd also has technical crew commentary as well. dvd has behind the scenes featurette, two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more. do not miss this great action film. screenplay by micheal france (fantastic four) and actor:stallone (the rocky series). based on a premise by john long. excellent cinematography by alex thomson, b.s.c. (alien³, demolition man, legend). oscar nominated for best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects. panavision. (****/*****).

after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'die hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. that is what they did with cliffhanger, die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly 'stop or my mom will shoot' stallone's career.cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! however, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.you've got to love john lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, rex linn as travers.he may of been henry in 'portrait of a serial killer' but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' and whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like ralph waite's frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.mention too must go to former 'london's burning' actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, hal needed a good kicking.so forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! and if you're looking for qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.

forget credibilityyou must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats, being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed, and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons... especially when renny harlin is directing."cliffhanger " is no exception. but the movie has numerous assets : breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed, stunning special and visual effects ( the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film ), excellent musical score, welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension, and a solid cast : two heroes ( stallone, star and cowriter, has the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent michael rooker more than stands his ground ), a charming heroin ( janine turner ), and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever ( priceless john lithgow and deceivingly feminine caroline goodall, but also rex linn - in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it, leon, craig fairbrass ) good, solid entertainment then , if no credibility.as roger ebert wrote ( about another film )"it's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't make the mistake of thinking too much."

the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo. but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion.the excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill, suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before.the biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end.good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes, the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years.

this movie is just great. it's entertaining from beginning to the end, you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker. together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker. and then, john lithgow, one of the best performances i've seen of him as a villain.and the fact that 75% of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action! brilliant movie!

cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director renny harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the rocky mountains. sylvester stallone is impressive as gabe walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. for the sake of the film though i willing to suspend my disbelief. the rest of the cast including john lithgow, michael rooker, janine turner, rex linn, caroline goodall, and leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. the action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. the climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. the deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. the villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. the pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. if you're a big fan of harlins or stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. overall cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.

was this based on a comic-book? a video-game? a drawing by a 3 year-old? there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all; not the characters, not the dialog, not the plot, not the action. nothing. we have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids, stallone's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather, dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious, and so on. even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ("tango-tango"). a film that entertains through some suspense, good action-sequences, and a nice snowy mountainous setting. oh, yes: and the unintentional humour.the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a "swell" time. then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part, which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out. and then we have some more bad dialog, and after that some more great action. this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell. stallone's melodramatic exchange with turner, when they meet after a long time, is so soapy, so clichéd, so fake, and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer. soon after this display of awful dialog-writing, we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane. the entire action is one big absurdity, but it's mindless fun at its best. although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film. after the landing, our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker. they send stallone to fetch the first case of money, but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it; they take most of his clothes off (so he can freeze) and they won't give him the equipment he needs (so he can fall off). do these gangsters want their money fetched or not??? very silly. apparently they don't trust stallone, but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage. nevertheless, our gangsters make stallone's climb difficult, if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts. and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are, they overact, brag, and snicker in a truly evil manner. everyone convinced? good. you'd better be. otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children, just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone.the old guy who flies the chopper... how the hell did he fall for the trap? firstly, he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals, and secondly, he must have heard stallone's and rooker's voices on the walkie-talkies. a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place, with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines. "get off my back!" lithgow: "i haven't even started climbing on your back." or, lithgow to stallone: "we had a deal, but now we only have each other!" and as for lithgow's gang of murderers: these guys never seem to want to kill immediately. they are very creative about it; they philosophize, pretend that they are playing football with your body, and so on. stallone co-wrote this thing. i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it. i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i.q.

since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite. since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it. the setting has a lot to do with it (the colorado i know would be jealous), but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes. there has not been a movie i can compare this too. john lithgow plays a smart villain, but i love how he is completely out of his element--he has to follow tucker around and that's what keeps it interesting. this is an action movie at it's best. i don't think i'll see another that is so entertaining.you don't need 50,000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie. it just has to keep you captivated, not shell-shocked.

to be honest, i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time. but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater. big mistake ! because the #1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and #2 is the cinematography. try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system. the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential). the more i see it, the more i like it.it's definitely one of renny harlin's best movie. this guy knows about action. die hard 2, the long kiss good bye, etc. and it's particularly good in this movie. the special effect are great and spectacular. stallone really needed that movie get back with success. still good to see him !

i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though i feared the worst.when gabe (stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. at least, that's what the rangers believe. in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. i know him best from the tv-series "3rd rock from the sun", but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. overall the acting is ok, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. i loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. i give it a 6.5/10. if you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.

watching cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as "die hard in a /on a." cliffhanger is "die hard on a mountain," and pretty good, for what it is.but unlike passenger 57 and under siege, which are decent die hard clones on their own terms, cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that, in their immensity, threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks.years before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations, cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings.the opening sequence has already received substantial praise, all of which it deserves: its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening. not even harlin's shot of the falling stuffed animal, which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke (and which he repeated in deep blue sea), or the ridiculous expression on ralph waite's face, can dim the sequence's power.the next impressive set-piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet. as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin, the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not: the bloody double-crosses are completely unexpected. as roger ebert has observed, the stuntman who made the mid-air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition.later, during the avalanche sequence, one of the terrorists/thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. so far as i know, no one was killed in the making of this movie (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts), so obviously a dummy was used for the shot. but the shot itself remains impressive because we're left wondering how harlin (or more likely one of the second-unit directors) knew exactly where to place the camera.i'll take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week, because he's one of the few movie stars i've ever seen who's completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain, and at the same time actually feels that pain. the role of gabe walker really complements stallone's acting strengths: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, giving an impressively low-key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself.in contrast to many of today's post-matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, stallone's walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer-enhanced abilities. in cliffhanger, the hero almost freezes to death, and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another. he winces when he's hit and bleeds when he's cut, particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rocky-style pummeling from one of the mad-dog villains.it should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when i first saw this movie as a teenager, i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust (or rather, the ice); at one point i actually cheered as one of the most cold-blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise.lithgow's british accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional model plane or model helicopter, but he's fundamentally a good actor, and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue: in one scene, looking at his hostages stallone and rooker, trying to decide which tasks to give them, he actually says "you, stay! you, fetch!" even a better actor, such as anthony hopkins, might have had trouble with that line.even if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside, it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show.early in the movie, for example, lithgow openly says to one of his men "retire [stallone] when he comes down." no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously: his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face, and this precipitates a gripping tug-of-war between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg.lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means, but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn't given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor.done very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or (at times) a western, cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film.besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before, the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow, as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action-packed narrative. finally, harlin's decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless, since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes.it's a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies, because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later. but perhaps it's best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time, without a sequel: there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already. there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit: compared to that clinker, cliffhanger belongs on the imdb's top 250 list.rating: 8 (very good, especially considering most of stallone's other movies.)

sly's best out and out action film. it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured. stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories. plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form. action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner, michael rooker and john lithgow. ****

wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber gabriel walker (stallone) comes back for his girlfriend jessie (janine turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a treasury department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit unfortunately, gab and hall (michael rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (john lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money with breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, "cliffhanger" is definitely stallone's best action adventure movie

i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin. 'die hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. that's right, you little punks, 'cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.sly plays gabe walker, a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend, hal tucker (michael rooker), assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. walker obviously came back at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen (john lithgow). qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u.s. government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back...essentially, 'cliffhanger' is another 'die hard' clone. just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. naturally, that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough, as stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease, and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. after all, isn't that what action movies are all about?'cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. a showcase of great scenes and stunts. one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning, it maintains its action awesomeness. john lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad dude. quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.'cliffhanger' is easily one of stallone's best efforts, definitely renny harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10

when i was six yo, i learned about a series called "los campeones", and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch "the champions" and "the avengers" once every week. i think that was the golden age of english series... (i already own the complete cycle of "the prisoner"!) but lasted also a few years later with "the tomorrow people", "the worst witch" (i just me, or this is "harry potter" in girl, of course, before as much as i want "the campions" to be in zone 1 or zone 4, i'm also waiting for "dr. who" (pack the whole series in a set of, uhm, maybe 300 dvd's, please, i couldn't expend more for it, 8), "people of tomorrow", and several other 'low budget', but great stories to be available within my reached zones. i speak and understand english, but not all my relatives do, including my parents, whom introduced me into these great stories... i hope someday, someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them... dubbed or subtitled, but in the same format i saw them. remember, zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set!

i wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily i managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......i was hooked. the premise was pretty simple; two hardened nemesis agents, richard barrett and craig stirling ( william gaunt and stuart damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) doctor and biologist (sharron macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...the series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and i guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.monty berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in episodes such as "happening" ( a studio deputising for the australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of "operation deep freeze" and "the beginning" but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. it had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from william gaunt).the chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about anthony nicholls awful wig!!). they all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. i have to say, i was always a richard barrett fan - i loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on tv. i have also followed bill gaunts career with interest since. however, craig stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and i am sure alexandra bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.the show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including donald sutherland, jeremy brett, peter wyngarde, burt kwouk, anton rodgers, kate o'mara, jenny linden, paul eddington and colin blakely.notable episodes for me were : "auto kill", "the interrogation", "the fanatics", "the mission" and "the gilded cage" but i am sure every one has their personal favourites.if you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and i don't think i will ever tire of it.enjoy!

my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re-runs of it one summer in the 1970's. we absolutely adored it. there was something so exotic and mysterious about it, especially when compared to the usual american re-runs (petticoat junction, green acres... you get the idea). it had a similar feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprise, since it was also british and in the spy/adventure genre).i would love to see it again now -- hopefully it holds up. i've mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence. but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it. hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.

well, what can i say, other than these people are super in every way. i quite like sharon mcreedy, i enjoy this pure nostalgic series and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes, i did not realise that they had made so many, i also think that it is a great shame, that they have not made any more. i wish that i got given these powers, imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. later on, i discover that my body has been enhanced. just like richard barrat. these stories are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. the music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon. who i thought was beautiful and intelligent. when i was a boy, i had a huge crush on her!!!! now i can see why, on my dvd set. the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series. i also thought that trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done!

monty berman and dennis spooner followed up 'the baron' with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted 'the six million dollar man'. it was a favourite of mine when i was a youngster, and i enjoy watching it still. stuart damon and william gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as craig stirling and richard barrett, while the luscious alexandra bastedo pouted her way through her role as sharron macready. the late anthony nicholls made a wonderfully gruff tremayne. by far the best episodes were those written by tony williamson, terry nation and brian clemens, while spooner's own 'the interrogation' compared favourably with 'the prisoner'. i regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. would craig and richard have been competitors for sharron's affections? what if tremayne had learned of the champions' powers? did the champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? we never found out, alas.

i was 10 years old when this show was on tv. by far it was my favorite. the actors were very credible. alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous.... i just order the dvd (15 episodes). they didn't have super-powers. they just had superior human skills (strength, hearing, sight). the 3 actors were very good in their rolls, very believable. there was a good story in each episode. at the time, there were no special effects or explosions everywhere, so the script was suppose to be good, and the characters performs were great. there was no fancy stuff, like in other shows. they didn't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff.

this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space. as a history of space flight, it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it. disney has shown it on "vault disney" and i wish they would do so again.

i have not seen this movie! at least not in its entirety. i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all. one sequence remains in my memory to this day. a (very convincing looking) spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon. the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him. the moon flashes into visability . . . . and for a few seconds there it is. parallel lines, squares, could it be .. then the light fades and the brief glimse of ...what... has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth. wonderful. i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie.

this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why. even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain. good use of live footage and animation in tandem. this used to run as part of "vault disney" every few months or so, but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* most recommended.

oh, where are you going, my little one, little one...turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four...i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on disneyland. i remember sitting there, electrified by werner van braune's explanations of rocket science. i watched as history, science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities.that was fifty years ago. and the shows are back in the disney treasures series, and what a treasure they are. i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter, who at first would not even come in the room, but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated. as she watched i watched her, and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as i had been.turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own...sure, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate, and the overall presentation is still impressive. i found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not only as a 50 year old artifact, but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history.turn around, turn around, turn around and again...you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.

buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when "humanizing" animals, and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them.based on a true story, buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other, and that they will do anything for each other.while not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children.this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets, but does show the difficulties.a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions.

trudy lintz (rene russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. they dressed in clothes and had many amenities. one day, she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. knowing nothing about the large apes, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. once out of danger, trudy decides she will raise the gorilla, also, as one of her children. this works well for years and buddy, the gorilla, is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. but, buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. will trudy be able to keep buddy under control? for those who love animals, buddy is a must-see movie. based on a true story, trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. of course, buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one, in the film, but he is very close to seeming totally real. russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. the costumes are exemplary, as befitting the earlier era of the story, and the settings and production values outstanding. but, most importantly, animals are here in abundance, not only buddy, but the adorable chimps, the ducks, the rabbits, and so forth. for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven, here on earth, this is a great movie choice. all animal lovers, and even those who just want to watch a great family film, will go "ape" over buddy.

i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. the gorilla looks just terrific, and the eyes were especially lifelike. it's even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top. rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine. usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla. it's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions we do, and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't. not many films venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity.

jane porter's former love interest harry holt(neil hamilton) and his friend martin (paul cavanagh) come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the "elephant's graveyard" first seen in tarzan, the ape man...only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions...namely jane. will tarzan stand for that? not likely (in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the "elephant's graveyard") and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party (including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead)is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions..will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time?this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up. the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously.

ever wanted to know just how much hollywood could get away with before the hayes code was officially put into effect? well, unfortunately "convention city" is lost, so well just have to watch "tarzan and his mate" to find out. for 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. just look at jane's nude swim. while tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out.in addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. i've always enjoyed the jungle films that hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre i'd call great films. "tarzan and his mate" is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. the sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). the acting won't win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. the film is once again stolen by cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. one of the most entertaining examples of pre-code hollywood out there.

make no mistake, maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. she is visually stunning. that aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. this is a great film. it not only has the classic tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. however, the africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. in fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. the finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. the great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. if i left anything out, it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it. but it is everything you could want in a movie.

tarzan and his mate(1934) was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid. it sounded boring. now i have seen it. i have seen the ape man(1932) about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive. it's a remarkable movie. it's almost flawless. tarzan and his mate(1934) however, falters. it's not harmonic and it's parts tend to live a life of there own. the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great. big budget expensive. tarzan himself is co-starring. jane dominates. she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead. well. she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant. she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father. forever. the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle. stupid? later someone founds it in the river. well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead. some cheap drama. the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone. she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away(to england). stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is, how hard he is to kill. the caravan is leaving and jane go along. again a pothole. she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more, to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband. she could be smart. she could dive where they found the floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana's. picking up traces shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane. she could talk to the apes, and so on. if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable. jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down. and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with "i blame myself as much as you". a punishment for being vane perhaps? nonsense. struggle, a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate. still. this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep. just lean back and enjoy. it's tarzan and jane for god sake.

108: tarzan and his mate (1934) - released 4/20/1934, viewed 8/6/08.john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa. bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas. births: ralph nader, gloria steinem, alan arkin, richard chamberlain.doug: after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man,' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film, 'tarzan and his mate,' was the best in the series. it's true. i got a huge kick out of this movie. johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging, animal dueling wild super-hero, and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane (who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). in my review for 'ape man,' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming, but she's redeemed herself for me here. make no mistake: o'sullivan is the star of this movie, and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals, and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets. she's even got her own jungle scream now. the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible. she's totally got him trained. cheeta is quite charming as well, taking drags off of martin's cigarette. the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle's most vicious animals, especially lions, crocodiles, and rhinos. the effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. all i can say is: yes, she is naked. very exciting stuff.kevin: wow. just wow. when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure, nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate.' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass, violent and risqué jungle epic. i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does. you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved, or animal rights-approved for that matter. the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies. and after t&j enter the picture, there's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims. see it for yourself if you don't believe me. i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film. in the first film, jane seemed like a walking contradiction, like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that. but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema. although she still requires tarzan's assistance in getting her out of most jams, she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued. her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. i watched this with my mom, and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan "trained," as jeff foxworthy put it. she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call. although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film, there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed (mostly) for real. that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around. **spoiler** the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing. although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious, i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again. **end spoiler** one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller's smooth, hairless bod and over-styled coif. other than that, this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed.last film: it happened one night (1934). next film: twentieth century (1934).

a year after losing gorgeous jane parker (maureen o'sullivan) to love rival tarzan, hunter harry holt (neil hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart. mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment, tarzan's stomping ground.accompanied by his slimy, womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers, harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes) only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller, and worse still, that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard.nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. of course, tarzan isn't deadonly wounded; after being nursed back to health by cheetah (!), he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked holt's expedition.tarzan and his mate, the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series; although i slightly prefer the original, i can definitely understand the film's popularity: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes, and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout, there's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy (despite o'sullivan's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double, the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin, even threatening to do a 'sharon stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side!).the film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular finalé where jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is rescued by her beau, his monkey pals, and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode (once again, the violence is surprisingly nasty at times, although as far as i am concerned, there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film). cheetah also has his fair share of excitement, dodging rhinos, crocs, and big cats, riding on tarzan's back as he crosses a river, and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride.like it's predecessor, tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection, a few laughable monkey suits, more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins, and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film. if anything, they make it even more fun!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for imdb.

one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic).picking up a year or so after tarzan the ape man, niel hamilton's holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory. his friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that holt hopes to use to win jane back from tarzan. before they can leave holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition. when they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded. they have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire. eventually tarzan and jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (its graphic even by todays standards. it probably would get a pg 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored). its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for tv. as it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be. its an amazing film by almost any standard. best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film. its an amazing thing.i really like this film a great deal.if there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well. the rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing. however on almost every other level this film is top notch.you really owe it to yourself to see this. make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time. this is one of the great adventures.

i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd (fully restored editions) & i never tire of watching them. my personal favorite is "tarzan and his mate", due entirely (well almost entirely) to maureen o'sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front. before anyone claims that a - it wasn't really her, or b - it wasn't really what it looks like, let me say that i have watched it numerous time, in high zoom mode, and trust me...it is her, and she is completely naked underneath that costume...several times, especially during the lion attack at the end, careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia...there is no mistake about that at all. as to the swimming scene being a body double in a "skin" suit, yes, it is a double, but she is not wearing any "skin" suit or anything else...again, slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it. now, that controversy out of the way, let's move on the actual movie...i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly...the action sequences were simply great, although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino, weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion...the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio & us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which. don't complain too much though, remember that 90% of all films is phony anyway, so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn, some cold beer, and a fresh pack of smokes...a sexy and willing girlfriend/wife isn't out of line either...lol. oh...one final word about nudity...at the very beginning, while the white hunters are speaking dialogue, keep your eyes on the background extras...there are several good shots of nude african girls (obviously shot on location) behind them. one more thing, the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's...that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then. shaft hadn't even been thought about at that time, nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history. safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads...and tiny's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane. as a matter of fact, it wasn't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so.

hard to believe, perhaps, but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose hayes code. yes indeed, priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin.i'm not making this up. they had several reasons, as follows:item: jane likes sex. she and tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter. she stretches sensuously, and with a coquettish look she says "tarzan, you've been a bad boy!" so they've not only been having sex, they've been having kinky sex! a few years later, under the hays code, people (especially women) weren't supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex.item: jane prefers a guileless, if wise and resourceful, savage (tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five man (holt). when holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from london, she wavers a bit; when holt tries to kill tarzan, and holt and jane both believe he's dead, she wavers a lot. but when she realizes her man is very much alive, the attractions of civilization vanish for her. and why not? tarzan's and jane's relationship is egalitarian: he lacks the "civilized" insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as "the head of his wife". to boot, he lacks many more "civilized" hangups, for example jealousy. when holt and his buddy arrive, tarzan greets them both cordially, knowing perfectly well that holt is jane's old flame. when holt gets her dolled up in a london dress and is slow-dancing with her to a portable phonograph, tarzan drops out of a tree, and draws his knife. jealous? nope. he's merely cautious toward the weird music machine, since he's never seen one before. once it's explained, he's cool.item: civilized holt is dirty minded. savage tarzan is innocently sexy. as jane slips into holt's lamplit tent, holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress. by contrast, after tarzan playfully pulls the dress off, kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her, there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema: the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet.(the scene was filmed in three versions--clothed, topless and nude--the scene was cut prior to the film's release, but the nude version is restored in the video now available.) and when jane emerges, and cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease, jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangups. where is the "universal prurience" so dear to the hearts of seminarians? nowhere, that's where. another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful. item: the notion that man is the crown of creation, and animals are here only for man's use and comfort, takes a severe beating. holt and his buddy want to be guided to the "elephant graveyard" so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home. they want tarzan to guide them to said graveyard. you, reader, are thinking "fat chance!" and you're right. he's shocked. he exclaims "elephants sleep!" which to him explains everything. jane explains tarzan's feelings, which the two "gentlemen" find ridiculous. item: jane, the ex-civilized woman, is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. holt and buddy blow it, and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. it is jane who maintains her cool. while the boys panic, she takes charge, barks orders at them and passes out the rifles.item: jane's costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath. (the original idea was for her to be topless, with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples, which indeed is the case in one brief scene.)lastly, several men of the cloth complained because the film was called "tarzan and his mate" rather than "tarzan and his wife." no comment!of course, tarzan, who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends, comes to the rescue, routs the white hunters, and induces the pack elephants and african bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came. the end.so there you have it. an utterly subversive film. like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, e.g., possessed with rita hayworth and raymond massey) which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30's and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the hays code. the joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by jane's soprano version of the famous tarzan yell. a nice touch, which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions.let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist jane, and sex.

tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle. some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization. but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave. one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back...even if that means killing tarzan.this is a rarity--a sequel that's better than the original. "tarzan, the ape man" of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged. this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult. there is tons of blatant racism (a black man is shot to death point blank--and no one really cares) but this was 1934. there's also plenty of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude! there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and (it's implied) they sleep together and have sex--without being married. this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme.that aside, the movie is well-directed, very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement. seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too. i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan. everybody else is ok.this is easily the best weismuller--o'hara tarzan out there. well worth seeing but not for kids!

the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller. the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again. just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role. if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a reference..you are missing a real treat. doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making, makeup set designs...no one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did. he was and is tarzan.

in the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies. johnny weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series. it definitely rates a "10" in my collection of films.

a very interesting entertainment, with the charm of the old movies. tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it, and we all enjoy with him his success.the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills (he was a great swimmer and had a great shout)

this splendidly-directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed tarzan series put out by mgm. it is a first-class adventure for many reasons, i suggest--fine photography, strong imaginative qualities, a delightful cast, good simulated-jungle locales and a very exciting storyline. johnny weissmuller plays tarzan, a mono-syllabic untutored sort unlike edgar rice burroughs' creation; but he is honest, loyal, brave and very courageous, and he needs to be during this narrative. as jane parker, his wife who had been jane porter in the novels, maureen o'sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality. the effect of the lighting, the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual. this is an outdoor adventure filmed on the mgm back-lot which really works. the fabulous mutir escarpment is a remote locale which allows tarzan and jane to live undisturbed; but into their idyll come people searching from them, emissaries of a civilization jane has left behind and into which tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated. one is harry holt, still in love with her, who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him; the gown and perfumes interest her, but she refuses to leave tarzan. tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals, in scenes that look like a humanized king king. the group claim to want to hunt animals, and tarzan agrees for jane's sake to a bit of big game trapping; but at some point, the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition's heads' minds. tarzan is shot, left for dead; and the group force jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous "elephant's graveyard". but they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions. tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call; in a most spectacular elephant-filled scene, he saves jane and what is left of the expedition, who return home little richer but much wise, as jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband. the film was directed by set-design wizard cedric gibbons, and quite beautifully too. his work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film,which manages to seem real despite all its hollywood shortcomings from start to finish. neil hamilton is a very good harry, paul cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad. forrester harvey and nathan curry round out a small cast very professionally. an unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well. recommended.

this was the second of the series of 6 "classic tarzan" movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane.as usual, this was a wonderful film in this series; and perhaps stands out as an "in between" film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s. as such, it displayed good pace, though not as good as subsequent films. likewise, the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series. the stock i saw was of uneven quality, containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes. the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here. on the other hand, there is one scene, very early on, in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up, showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle, was really almost modern in its style, and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie.regarding plot, one interesting feature here was jane's near-fickleness and inconstancy, when she was being subject to martin's flirtations. the kiss  and jane's stunned, and partly guilty, reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films. compare, for example, in tarzan finds a son! jane's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family. later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong. here, nothing quite so explicit, but we have jane "returning" to the jane parker of yesteryear, and in an almost repentant series of actions, stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan.there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing.for one thing, the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here, as later, a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death. this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience.i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today's standards.there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure: tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants' graveyard; tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo, and then nursed to health by the apes; cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment; cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log. the final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees. jane, showing us that she is truly of tarzan's world now, quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away.the final series of scenes is splendid: suddenly tarzan is on the scene, flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions, and summoning the elephants to the rescue! that final cry of tarzan in triumph, holding a happy jane in his arms, with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them, is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane.all in all, this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie. i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone.

"tarzan and his mate", the second of mgm's tarzan pictures, picks up a year after the events of "tarzan the ape man". tarzan and jane have been living happily in the jungle, and harry holt (one of the expeditioners in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable martin arlington, in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard. naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way.the first film romanticized everything--the jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals, and even death. the second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone underlies the action. the characters dare to ask questions like: what if something happened to tarzan? what would jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself? while these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation, it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original.one of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in tarzan and jane's relationship. tarzan still speaks very broken english, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate. additionally, their love for each other has really blossomed, and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle.most people consider "tarzan and his mate" superior to the original "tarzan the ape man". personally, i liked the first film just a little bit better. the main reason is that the relationship between the harry holt & martin arlington team isn't nearly as likable as holt's relationship with james parker (jane's father) from the original. the mr. arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain, but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie. the movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. (also, i don't want to give anything away, but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him, jane never finds out about those events, so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.) all of these detractors are relatively minor, however, and it's still a great movie.like the first film, "tarzan and his mate" has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife footage, and one of the screen's all-time greatest romances. if you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a sequel to see.

when i was a kid it was lex barker's time as tarzan. i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller "was" tarzan and i wouldn't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape. it wasn't after many years that i came across "tarzan and his mate", and then i understood. weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker, gordon scott, jock mahoney, denny miller, miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert.as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong, self minded, active and "no-inhibitions" woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made (tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the "janes" to come such as brenda joyce, vanessa brown, virginia huston or dorothy hart, all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle.o'sullivan character's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily; the combination is perfect. another highlight in the movie is cheeta's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day."tarzan and his mate" stands as a fine product in its genre (tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, though i have to admit that i also enjoyed "tarzan's greatest adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast (and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect "all gymnasium" physical looks that doesn't fit for a rustic ape man).good for jane and her mate!

like tarzan the ape man (1932), only more so. there's more of everything, more animals, more varied african tribes, and scenes in which the thought must be, if this was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. tarzan wrestles with crocodilesthe the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin, around and around, jaws flapping. tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still. tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals. his friends are real chimps, people wearing larger ape costumes, and elephants. in fact, they use indian elephantsfar more friendly and trainable than african oneswith costume ears attached to their heads. the human story: another white man, worse than the rest, shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard. tarzan won't show them the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed. tarzan intercedes, and the bad guy shoots himbut, of course, he survives and returns to save jane. everybody else dies, holt and the bad guy and every single one of their "boys." people are expendable, especially africans, and there doesn't seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them. this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes. there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude, and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing. apparently one of weismuller's friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes, and not maureen o'sullivan. she, however, moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears (plus a bikini top), showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip. they still don't need to talk a lot. they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. no wonder they're happy.

i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.after the original film, we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.the skin show in this film is off the charts. in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan. (although it is not o'sullivan, but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene) weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry. although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.

as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies. unlike others however, i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle. in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle. the film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers. in addition sexy jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! not to be missed an adventure classic.

considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films, i have no argument with that, although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining. one thing: it's the longest of the series that i've seen at 105 minutes. i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long.nonetheless, it is a good mixture of action, suspense and romance. the only things missing are color and stereo sound. the primitive special-effects don't bother me, as that was all that they had back in the 1930s.among some, this film is most noted for one thing: skin! "jane" never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made. her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed. the nude underwater scene, however, was not her - by a longshot. the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all, whoever it was.there is plenty of action in here. up to the finale, it was not overdone, either. the ending went on for 15 minutes, though, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch.still, this movie offers about everything - except "boy" (their adopted son) - you'd want to see in a tarzan film, even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times. with her pair of "lungs," that was no problem.

there's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece greystoke. once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. maureen o'sullivan is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie. weismuller is solid as well. highly recommended.

the release of tarzan the ape man, in 1932, caused a sensation. it may be hard to believe, 70 years later, but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix, or the lord of the rings has achieved, at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment. tarzan became an instant pop icon, the 'noble savage' that every woman fantasized about, and every man wished he could be. the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice burroughs, who, while he'd agreed to mgm's creative liberties, and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks, felt the 'dumbed down' version of his character (with no plans to allow him to 'grow') was unfaithful to his vision (he would start a production company, and soon be making his own 'tarzan' films). mgm, realizing the value of it's newest 'star', knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original...and tarzan and his mate delivered!the film had an interesting back story; cedric gibbons, mgm's legendary art director, had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel, prior to the release of tarzan the ape man, despite the fact that he'd never directed before (the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact, and didn't think a novice director would matter much on a 'novelty' film...and they wanted to keep their oscar-winning department chief happy). gibbons, a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist, loved the freedom of pre-code hollywood, and decided to have tarzan and his mate 'push the envelope' to the limit...tarzan and jane would frolic in a nude swim, and jane would appear topless through most of the film. maureen o'sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death, in 1998, that while a double was used for the swim, she trusted the studio, and did 'a couple of days' of filming sans top...but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples, and the idea was abandoned (the film shot those days would be worth a fortune!) she did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent, flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her 'swim', and donned a revised 'jungle' costume that was extremely provocative, very thin, and open at the sides...and the resulting outcry would help 'create' the hays office, and the self-censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry.mgm yanked gibbons from the production (the 'official' reason given was his workload as art director), and veteran jack conway was listed as the new director, to appease the critics...although james c. mckay actually directed the film, as conway was busy on 3 other projects, including viva villa!the film incorporated the best elements of the original (safaris, murderous tribes, tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save jane), and actually improved on the storytelling. harry holt (neil hamilton), from the first film, returns to africa for ivory from the 'elephants' graveyard', and to try to seduce jane into returning to england, with gifts of silk dresses, underwear, and perfume. he brings with him martin arlington (paul cavanagh), a crack shot and inveterate womanizer, who sneers at holt's chivalrous pursuit of jane, and stalks her as a potential 'conquest', to be had by any means (including killing tarzan, if and when he can get away with it without being seen).tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with jane, and puts his foot down, refusing to allow the hunters into the graveyard. arlington finds his opportunity, catching the ape man alone, and shoots him, then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise. now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle, and she can direct them to the graveyard, before her long voyage back to england, comforted by the oh-so-sympathetic arlington. but a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group...can tarzan, being nursed back to health by his ape 'family', recover in time to save jane?while stock footage is again used extensively, the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent, and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits, tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other 'tarzan' film, as well as a sexiness that even bo derek's blatantly erotic tarzan, the ape man couldn't touch. johnny weissmuller was in peak condition, physically, maureen o'sullivan was never more beautiful, and 'africa' never looked more romantic, and dangerous.tarzan and his mate was a triumph (although it would be drastically edited for many years), and remains the classic of the series, to this day!

when i started watching the show i said "oh, no! it's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody!". and indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.but this is where the resemblance stops. the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. the magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the holy grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. however, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that i liked more, but were from other genres, i have to say that i was very pleased.

this anime seriously rocked my socks. when the anime first opened itself, i felt it was too slow; the story wasn't quite moving forward, and shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead. once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about saber and the holy grail war itself, the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together. it was fantastic.additionally, i felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop, in the real world. there wasn't any stupid completely obvious things going on; the development of ilya and rin was interesting to watch, but i think the way shirou and saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on. a few of the "surprise" people that show up (gilgamesh?) seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another, meaning we didn't have "generic bad-ass a" being replaced by "generic bad-ass b" as soon as a died.anddd, i loved the music. the opening music rocked, and the finishing theme from the final episode just...seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. good job, type-moon!

fate/stay night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h-stuff. it couldn't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(you'll understand once you see all the episodes).despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time on presenting the characters) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid-series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat.the topic of the series concentrates on the war of holy grail that has been taking place in the fukuky city for the last 50 years. the pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on. shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city.he unwillingly witnesses a fight between two servants that triggers his reiju (holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield, saber. his first contact with saber left him stunned "such immeasurable beauty ...i was at a lost for words". you mustn't compare this series with any other to fully understand it's plot. fsn offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, it offers excellent character and relationship development. it presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate. the action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type other series use) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, from under the mask of perfection, flawed characters.the saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. you shouldn't watch fsn thinking that it doesn't present the viewer with the historic fact, just remember that this is adventure/fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can. the ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes i would have watched them in the same breath.

i have to agree with everyone else that has posted.i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you, whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling i got when watching it, and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience.i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and i found all my answers and a whole lot more. i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime, it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime)i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story, well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action.also, even though this was based on a h-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way.(i have no problem with mature anime, in most cases i prefer it)

when i first heard about this series on animetv,i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen,this one tops it all off. i had to see this show,and that is what i really did. when i got the first volume of this show,it was the best. i really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber,and archer and of course i also like illya. and of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie(famous for transformers,and others) playing the voice of berserker. he does have a cool character. and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. so if you to see something good,then see this show,it's the best.

i've watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion. this series is actually based off an h-game, which i'm not sure if it's been done before or not, i haven't played the game, but from what i've heard it follows it very well.i give this series a 10/10. it has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animation i've seen. it also has some great japanese music in it too!if you haven't seen this series yet, check it out. you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there, it's straight out of japan.

this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time & through time to when one's childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back & forth onwards & upwards,forwards & backwards,up & down & all around.the boy jimmy,h.r. puffinstuff,dr.blinky,cling & clang,ludicrous lion,& even the evil witchie poo too through & through. the latter day inspirations of lidsville,"the brady kids saturday morning preview special" sigmund & the sea monsters,and land of the lost both the new & old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as the donny & marie show,the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a. brady bunch hour & even the paul lynde halloween special. maybe even other things in between & beyond the buck just keeps on moving on & on & even beyond expectations & as well as unexpected bounds.now as we get updated in march of '06 we know that jack wild's gone & so now it make's it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic.including now in august of '06 both when jack wild guest stars as himself on sigmund and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h.r.puffinstuff does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic journeys of all the syd & marty kroft characters as well including the h.r.puffinstuff goodtime club;the donny and marie show;the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a. the brady bunch hour;etc. truthfully,stephen "steve" g. baer a.k.a. "ste" of framingham,ma.usa.

i used to watch pufnstuf every weekend when i was about 10. it was on right after bay city rollers. i saw it come on to family channel one day, and taped it for my then three-year old daughter. i'd forgotten all the things i'd loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, witcheepoo's makeup.this show is decidedly low tech. the mayor is surely a precedent to mayor mccheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes. but kids love this stuff. they would way, way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation. there is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people dying, and kids accept jimmy's schemes. kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire, and i loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought witchypoo was flying overhead. the music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. she used to sing "different is hard, different is lonely" in the car. my daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it's still one of her favourites.i see that a new pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. i really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc. i think a whole new generation would love pufnstuf.

i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s - and it stayed with me! it's charming, loud, colourful - a great kids film. i put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la "meet the feebles" but no - its wholesome clean fun.jack wild is in fine form, as is mama cass, and the somehow attractive witchy poo.if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re-create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe!even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away! quality tv movie - if, like me, you are into death metal - you'll love it!

pufnstuf is what it is. i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond, and vivid, memories of it. seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where jimmy's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel (cass) sneers "i knew she had brown roots!". it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. the track different, for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different. this could be an anthem to the gay community, it should be, great track.martha raye, cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches, and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits (includes billy barty, felix silla and other famous names). there is a lot of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling. this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel. while i think of it - i never could stand the flute though.i love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world, pufnstuf and even jack wild's touching if i could. what's more, it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london. see here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm

this is why i still have nightmares.this terrifying film (a musical) was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s.a boy leaves on a magical journey to an island. the mayor of the island, pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon, looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me, and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch (billie halliday, who was considered 'a bit of alright' at the time).the flute is recovered at an 'interesting' witches convention, with the witches having a gay old time. the boy dresses in drag then as a 'fairy' to recover the flute.not suitable for children.

i grew up with h.r. pufnstuff and the dashingly talented jack wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of jack wild too. this movie is exactly what movies should be: fun and entertaining. this movie is not limited to children either. a lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully. and as a jack wild fan, i would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing. knowing the hard life that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song "if i could". it makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that i am now passing on to my children. let's all go to living island where there is friendship and fun! and keep jack wild's memory alive by passing pufnstuff on to others.

i two came home from school fast as i could to catch hrpuff and stuff on t.v. that was the most fun time in my life is to watch hrpuff and stuff on t.v. growing up still love it today i am 46 years old. this year......

i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid. i cried every time i watched it. it wasn't weird to me. i totally identified with the characters. i would love to see it again (and hope i wont be disappointed!). pufnstuf rocks!!!! i was really drawn in to the fantasy world. and to me the movie was loooong. i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them? the acting i thought was strong. i loved jack wilde. he was so dreamy to an 10 year old (when i first saw the movie, not in 1970. i can still remember the characters vividly. the flute was totally believable and i can still 'feel' the evil woods. witchy poo was scary - i wouldn't want to cross her path.

despite the patronage of george lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in "lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday. brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), synonamess botch (the hilariously foul-mouthed villain) and rod rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: frivoli vs. murkwood or, the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. in this context, the mor-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do. it's a real pity, therefore, that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot (culled from a tv screening) of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd. interestingly, both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities.

a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music. this epitomizes the 80's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work. personally i liked greensleeves and the other harsher characters. they had some of the more amusing lines.

you'll probably never see it, but the uncut version is about 50% better than the one you can buy. put it another way: once you've seen it in its original form, the current version is only half as good.it's still wildly creative and sick, a total success on so many levels.

this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today, if it weren't for advances in cgi. and that's just to say that he'd be forgotten, too, if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since 1983. _twice..._ has got the same wit, imagination, and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick, only executed under the restrictions of the medium c. 1983. innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels. it should be spoken of in the same breath with _spiritited away_ and _toy story_.

one of the most unheralded great works of animation. though it makes the most sophisticated use of the "cut-out" method of animation (a la "south park"), the real talent behind "twice upon a time" are the vocal characterizations, with lorenzo music's (carlton from tv's "rhoda") woody allen-ish ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece. the "accidental nightmare" sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed.

ralph and mumford, misfits in their own land, get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch. twice upon a time is the story of them, the characters they meet, and their struggle to set things right. with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business, this offbeat movie hits the mark.the animation process, while similar to that of the cut out "south park" style, is much smoother and far more three-dimensional. if i didn't know that the animation was this style, i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink. if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx, please do! you won't really miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience!

ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie (george was just the producer - he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money) - the 'adult' version was made possible by bill couterie. john korty didn't like or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). thanks to ladd films going under, they didn't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for "the right stuff", hoping it would pull them through;... and it didn't. so, this movie never really had a chance. when "twice" made it to cable (hbo) - they showed the reels with bill's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore (did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't on for very long?). showtime got the 'clean' version. the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john (who holds more power than bill). it's a pity, really, as the 'adult' version is actually better and does make more sense. but it's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd (or any other format short of bootleg). sorry to disappoint everyone. i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club (still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the 'adult' version, but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now). 8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. any other questions, just ask.

beside the fact, that in all it's awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations, this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it's best! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it. as usual a woman concieling her true intentions. the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brother.the scenes in 'wiking land' are just as i remember it from my early time travels. - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection.i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill.-odin-

it tries to be the epic adventure of the century. and with a cast like shô kasugi, christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time. it's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had. big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. this on the other hand, just has the real feeling. you just can't hate it. i think it's an okay adventure movie. and i really love the soundtrack. damn, i want the theme song.

this was a really cool movie. it just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. it traverses continents in seconds, people get shot and nothing happens to them, swords set on fire, samuari fight on sinking galleons, david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude. i enjoyed this movie but i like s**t movies, this is the perfect example of a very s**t movie that just kicks ass. if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film, its swashbuckling, its fast, its silly, its samuaraitastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it also looks as if it was made in 1972

for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon, viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia. in that context it is wonderful, but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. the plotline is also a bit limp for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well. jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years, created to boost the morale of the troops. she gave a double meaning to the "strip" in strip cartoon.the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard. the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era, a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders, and set in the african jungle of course.for jane fans, a must see. for the rest of you, a damp squib.

i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday. it's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a turquoise necklace, i loved it and would like to see it again! i don't remember too much about it, but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family, and i don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. his sister packs him some food and he goes. while he's out there, some other indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is the boy. i was always fascinated with legends, particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd, please release it, whoever's concerned!

this movie was great and i would like to buy it.the boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.the eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up. later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same. only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer. but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him,and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was.please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know.i haven't seen it for over 30 years,but still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com

man, i loved this movie! this really takes me back to when i was a kid. these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good, they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward. i still remember one of the opening lines...."tutazema was his name, and he was an orphan. he lived with his sister so and so in the village." this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon. at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself. he gets to live the way he always wanted to. he gets to soar the heavens.

oh, the sixties. there were some interesting films. i was more of a movie goer then. i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater. i also saw this short film, " the legend of the boy and the eagle". i have been searching for this film for years. it was truly inspiring. surprisingly, i was finally able to gather more information from your site. thank you........ i'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture. i too did not remember the disney film. i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney. i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime. i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film? is it available on dvd? this is a must see for all generations!!!

i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time, and how great it would be to find it on dvd...i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old, in the netherlands. and i was very impressed by it. it was shown before walt disney's jungle book! what i remember of this movie is fragmented. i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle. this impressed me very much. for some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not grasp the reason for this). when other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off. at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend. as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace. cb

my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a russian fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle. he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. since we have indian blood he connects to this movie. on january 27th he will turn 47 years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. he lives in thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. can you help me obtain this movie? thanking you in advance, dolly crout-soto, deerfield beach, fl

i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney. this movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and i have been looking for it. i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then,, this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once, i really hoped i would get to see it again. the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory. to this day, i never did see it after that day back in the 70s, in fact, i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me. i loved it and want my kids to see it.does anybody know where i can find it?

i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when 6 or so years old in 1967?. i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then mowgli for the next year. i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again. when we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be? my dad then said 'i bet you wished to be an eagle' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away...

my favorite movie. what a great story this really was. i'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible.

i have seen this movie when i was about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and i never forgot this movie! i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. and i just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die...my sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday. so it isn't just me.this movie is a must see !!!you will never forget it - just like my sister and me...

i read so many comments that i, too, shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but i didn't know the name of the movie. thankfully, because of doing a search and finding the title on this site, i read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie i remembered. i then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later. because of this site and your comments, you helped me and so i want to thank all of you. i want to share how i was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well. it was on the vhs version of wonderful world of disney's "call it courage" which contained 2 movies, the second one being "the legend of the boy and the eagle." it touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now i own my own copy of it. i think it is only available on vhs. i found it on ebay and i have seen several copies of it there. enjoy it, i know i did!it is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of. when it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy set the eagle free because he couldn't allow it to be killed. after the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle, the eagle, too, saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. the closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable. what a wonderful era this was. i have never seen anything come even close to this movie!

i just caught an episode about brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started. i have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction. here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arriving he insults lance armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general. understandably, he is soon asked to leave. most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what i wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass?at any rate, i was confused about how the show was put together, since it shows brad at the height of his addiction. we see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. i didn't even know that was legal to show, but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that? do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good tv episode?at any rate, it is an enlightening show, because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives. sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference, although i have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut. there are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe i should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end, and i have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life. but still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain too much about something like that

'intervention' has helped me with my own addictions and recovery. i'm a middle-aged married father of two. i'm quite functional in my personal and professional life. still, i have pain from my past that i use addictions to soothe, and issues from which i am slowly recovering. when these addicts and their families share their lives with me, they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family.the show, unlike many others, digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction. many of us suffer because it's too scary to go back and do, as alice miller says, "the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood." the show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started. this digging is painful and difficult, but worth it. so much coverage of addiction -- fictional and non-fictional -- seems to ignore the underlying issues. often it's assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self-interest, and now they can't stop. not so: addictions are about killing pain. i can relate to the different events and hardships in people's lives. there are common themes, and surprising exceptions. many addicts have suffered miserable abuse. some kids simply respond badly to divorce. to those who think that addiction is an over-reaction to a hardship, i would just say that different people respond differently. although some kids handle divorce well, others, like cristy in the show, "collapse in a heap on the floor" and have their lives forever changed by the event.for example, last night's counselor said that pretty young andrea seeks validation from men. she strips for cash for a 75-year old neighbor and lets men abuse her. sound familiar to anyone? the series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives. often it's those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest. as they say, even a stopped watch is right twice a day, but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while, until it's made your life miserable.to the producers: thank you for making the show, for digging into the past, for the follow-ups. also, the graphics, the format, and the theme music are brilliant.to the addicts: thank you for your courage to share. whether or not you have helped yourself, you have helped me.

i find i enjoy this show, but the format needs some work. first off, the good attributes. i like how this show will take us through the day-to-day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they've allowed their lives to become. this is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome. intervention doesn't candy-coat things and sometimes the outcome (often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing) is a negative outcome. this makes the positive outcomes all the better.another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work. given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don't have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable. it's actually superior to scripted shows like "the shield" where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea.now for the bad. an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show. you'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you're thrown into the story of another. get caught up in that story then suddenly you're back to the first addict...or are you? by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to. this constant flip-flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions! i once heard the marketing b.s. reason for this poor design: "the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they're watching." oh please. clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren't big enough for an hour show so they mix two together. by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block, like they should, it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing (and the commercials) if they are interested in one case but not the other.i used to find these "blender" episodes so annoying that i'd only tell my tivo to record episodes containing one addict, but then it became easier just to record all of them.

this show is awesome! i have been a fan since it premiered, and it only keeps me watching... i've seen some terrible things here, that i wish i hadn't, but, it really shows you how addiction affects all involved, not just the addict. you can see all kinds of different addictions, from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict, or the eating disorder addict. and actually, it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also. we've seen accomplished musicians, an nba player, and even young people, who really need the help. and since they have started showing a few follow-ups, that's been awesome too. now, you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired. if you haven't checked this one out, please do. it's on a&e, and it's awesome! the new eps are sunday nights at 10pm est, if i remember correctly... so set your tivo!

the surprise nominee of this year's best animated feature race at the oscars. it's an irish film by heart, but it was co-produced by belgium and brazil, with, i'm guessing, animators working in all three countries. the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory. the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film persepolis from a couple of years back, with very simple characters with thick, black outlines. this film is not in black and white. oh no. what makes this film great is its use of color, simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i've ever seen. the general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical, with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals. much of the film can be spent playing find the circle - a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. all of these geometrical designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts (the book of kells is a real illuminated bible; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it). the story of the film isn't especially deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy tale. brendan is a young boy in kells, a city surrounded by enormous walls, built by his uncle to keep out vikings. a newcomer to kells, brother aiden, inspires brendan to take up illustrating. he also inspires him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest, within which lives a nymph. bruno coulais provides a fantastic score, almost as good as the one he did for coraline, which i consider the very best of the year.

first animated feature film from ireland is also one of the best animated films i've ever seen. its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year.the plot of the film has the abbot of kells, a village in ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack. his nephew brendon, is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time. when a legendary illuminator aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery, brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality. much to his uncle's chagrin aiden offers to teach brendon how to illuminate. in order to help aidan work on his great book, saved from his destroyed monastery, brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink. while outside the walls he meets ashley, a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship. unfortunately the abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay. but lurking in the distance are the vikings...forget what you think you know about this film you're wrong. even what i've explained doesn't do this film justice. its a simple story with so much more going on. this is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world, over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls. (as the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn't cease to be even if you build walls).its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness. there is death and destruction and joy and happiness. its not sugar coated. people die. monsters lurk. (it freaked out some of the kids), but in the end there is hope. frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent american film. forget the "sadness" in a pixar film, this is the real thing, and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even pixar has become.its a genndy tartakovsky-esquire (samurai jack) animated film who's look is actually based upon the the celtic art of the period. its a film that looks unlike any other. here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible. the images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary book of kells. its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.director tomm moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece. i can't say more than that. its a masterpiece. its one of the best animated films i've ever run across.

this animated feature (a co-production between ireland, belgium and france) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie: the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript, the book of kells. in this fantastic retelling of that story, a prepubescent boy named brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings, must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named aidan needs to finish the book. to do that task, in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named aisling.gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand (there is some computer animation in a few key passages) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes, this film is relentlessly strange, but is a good strange, not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort. if one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an african monk in 9th century ireland  one would have to say that the blend of catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce. and the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. that's why i cannot give them the highest ranking. but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.

a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism. setting the story around the famous book of kels, believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona, off the western coast of scotland.telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom-cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. in hopes of recovering a lost artefact.the films true beauty lies in its' animation. cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity. deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series 'samurai jack' for its genius use of mark making and background depth, the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion.the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic-revivalist mysticism. the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is, as she glides from branch to branch. appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland.the secret of kels is an absolute treat. for all genders, all ages, it's a lovely piece of family cinema.don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed!

while watching this movie i was frustrated and distracted and by the end, i wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. i thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. even my a.d.d couldn't keep up. it felt like a slight acid trip. everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. there were so many shapes, lines and patterns. i really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. but after i finish watching it, i went online to read up on the movie and i should have done a little research into this movie before watching.the secret of kells is loosely based on the true story about the original book of kells. a small boy, brendan, is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written. this book will contain information that will help "change darkness into light." brendan lives in the village of kells behind huge stone walls. taking place in the 8th century, brendan's uncle, the abbot of kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the vikings out. brendan's uncle insist he help complete the wall, but a traveler and keeper of "the book" secretly trains brendan to hone in on his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete "the book" and carry out it's word.the entire time i watched the movie i thought i was missing something because i didn't really understand what was going on. i figured i was just missing a piece of irish history. a simple google search taught me all i needed to know about the original book of kells. after reading many articles, my opinion of the movie greatly changed.the book of kells is a copied version of the first few books of the new testament transcribed into latin by gaelic monks in ireland in the 8th century. along with it's paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of early art form know for it's intricacy, complexity, and miniature illustrations. much of the art in the book of kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time, flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective. but what makes the book of kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it's use of many colors.the secret of kells is very colorful. i originally thought the animation was flat and boring. it reminded me a lot of the cartoon samurai jack which also had a flat and "amine" look to it. once i learned about the art styles of the book of kells, it's obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie. there are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit brendan's mind. whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen. the edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles. transitions are filled with color, and celtic knots. from the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns.clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits, the secret of kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. i think one has to generally be open-mined to the secret of kells as half art piece, half movie about history. despite looking like it was animated with adobe illustrator, it's a very nice looking movie. but based on the 20 films submitted for oscar consideration, i don't think it was worth being nominated over mary and max.thatwasjunk.blogspot.com

the secret of kells is one of the most unique, beautiful, and eye- popping animated films i have ever seen. before watching this film, i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but i found in kells a serious contender.the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan, who lives with his uncle, the abbot of kell. the abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy's imagination. when the legendary brother aidan (who looks surprisingly like willie nelson) shows up and takes the boy under his wing, brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him (and saves his life more than once). with aisling's help, he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into light.see my full review of the secret of kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html

the secret of kells is an independent, animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells, an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament. i didn't know that this book actually exists, but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier. there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be, who wrote it, and how it has survived over 1,000 years. this is one of them.we are introduced to brendan, an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle, abbot cellach (voiced by brendan gleeson). abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks. brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks. they are more focused on reading and writing, something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore. he fears the "northmen," those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground.one day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland. it is brother aidan, a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished. abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him. aidan has special plans for brendan. first he needs ink for the book, but he requires specific berries. the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest, an area off limits to brendan. seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work, he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence.in the forest brendan meets ashley, the protector of the forest. she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company. she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it. there are things worse than vikings out there. from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion.i like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about. knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains, the animation makes perfect sense. i'm sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago, with frilly borders, colorful pictures, and extravagant patterns, creatures, and writings adorning the pages. much like the opening frames of disney's the sword in the stone. the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns. it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other.i couldn't take my eyes off of the incredible detail. this is some of the finest 2d animation i have seen in years. it's vibrant, stimulating, and full of life. the characters are constantly surrounded by designs, doodles, and patterns in trees, on the walls, and in the air just floating around. it enhances the film.the story is satisfactory, although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more. with a runtime of only 75 minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act. it doesn't give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book. we are reminded of it's importance but never fully understand. we are told that it gives hope, but never why or how. that was really the only lacking portion of the film. otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation.i guess that's okay to a certain degree. the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short. the story lacks a few parts, but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history. i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about. i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more. this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed.

the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart. the shortcomings of the film's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages. historically this was in the late 8th century, when the centers of irish learning were over-run by the vikings. the vikings appear here as brute antagonists, the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east. the film's narrative--- which functions more as a parable--- centers around the conflict between brendan, who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness, and his stern uncle the abbot-- who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen. the abbot disregards the value of brendan's art in his quest for security. this is the movie's outer conflict. brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells. this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros, who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without (that's as much of the story as i'll divulge!)what i really like about this film is its creators' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from 1200 years ago. the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells. (particularly noteworthy is monk aidan's pet cat, defined in few lines, yet purely--- and even magically metamorphically feline.) the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators. the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene, and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells. of course, historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict. however, by introducing archetypal elements into this story, the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in ireland which feels psychologically true, however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact. (the united nations' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues' club of artists in the secret of kells aren't historically probable, but they're all well-designed, individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story.) animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures. the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source, but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling; if animation had existed in the dark ages, the secret of kells is what it would look like! finally, brendan's hero's quest in this film is the artist's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty, life and inspiration. (without being preachy or even particularly christian, this movie affirms jesus' dictum that "man does not live by bread alone." ) in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky's andrei rublev, a film about the great russian icon painter of the 15th century. the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist's visual quest and creative process. it's certainly not as profound as andrei rublev, but--- heck--- its a cartoon! (and one which will appeal to young and old alike.) i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing: in its own modest life-affirming way, this stylized secret of kells is a classic.

i would not have known about this film if not for its "surprise" oscar nomination for best animated feature film. thankfully, it came to pass that i was able to watch this animated little treasure.the story is about the child brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective abbot of the township of kells. the main pre-occupation of the abbot is to build a wall to protect kells from the attacking vikings. one day, aiden, the renowned illustrator from iona, sought refuge with them. aiden opens brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. along the way, brendan befriended the white forest sprite aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration."the secret of kells" is unlike most of the animation released these days. it is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. the movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of "kung fu panda." however, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience. the reds used in the viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting.try to catch this quiet gem of a film. it is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as "monsters vs. aliens" and the like. the sparse celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film. ok, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. i would have liked to know more about the book that brendan and aiden was working on. but the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork, said to be based on the artwork in the real book of kells.

the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville. although stylistically very different, kells shares with triplets and (the jaw-dropping opening 2d sequence of) kung fu panda, incredible art direction, production design, background/layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one's senses. kells is so lavish -- almost gothic in its layout (somewhat reminiscent of klimt), wonderfully flat in general overall perspective, ornate in its celtic & illuminated design, yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- and it all works together beautifully. you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush. what tomm, nora, ross, paul and all at cartoon saloon (& their extended crews) have achieved with this small budget/very small crewed film, is absolutely astounding. the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal. this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire. congratulations to kells on its many accolades, its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run. they are all very well-deserved nods, indeed...

the secret of kells is a film i've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the cartoon saloon in kilkenny. i'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait. the cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as i'd feared. the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, i particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page. the characterisation is superb, i love brendan gleeson's voice as the stern abbot and i especially liked the voice of the sprite aisling. the forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. the story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy. and really draws the viewer in to cheer on brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the book. i'm a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people i know who've seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it's a lovely little film. i will definitely buy the dvd when it's released, and would like to say, well done cartoon saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. may there be many more. :) coming back in here to say that i bought several copies of the dvd as soon as i could and gave them out at christmas, everyone loves it! and i wish them all the luck in the world at the oscars, such a joy to see this nominated.

by 1945, and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces, errol flynn’s hold over u.s. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler. the first of these was a good one actually – adventures of don juan (1948) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget hollywood starring vehicle. the rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over europe: in england for kim (1950), the master of ballantrae (1953) and the dark avenger (1955), in france for adventures of captain fabian (1951) and italy for the aborted the story of william tell (1953) and the little-seen crossed swords (1954). however, hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers ‘a’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak… still, the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady maureen o’hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles, so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain roc brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. like the black shield of falworth (1954) – a viewing of which preceded this one – against all flags takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring italian channels.for all i know, this might well have been the very first pirate movie i’ve ever seen and i cringe at the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the caribbean trilogy is what buccaneering is all about! as i said earlier, against all flags might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same. nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like indian princess (alice kelley) towards her pirate captor flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of the sea hawk (1940) and the black swan (1942), to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging. incidentally, the film would later go on to be remade as the king’s pirate (1967) with doug mcclure! for what it’s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on dvd and, as a matter of fact, against all flags itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “pirates of the golden age movie collection” set from universal which also consisted of obscure dross like buccaneer’s girl (1950; with yvonne de carlo), doule crossbones (1951; with donald o’connor) and yankee buccaneer (1952; with jeff chandler)! value for money, perhaps but, so far, i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward dmytyk’s mutiny (1952), the afore-mentioned yankee buccaneer and pirates of tortuga (1961).

being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in maureen o'hara (what an exquisite beauty!) and anthony quinn, i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.hollywood at its best!

a featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is. lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip. and there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads. quinn makes a good villain also, although his role is completely overshadowed.but don't be fooled by maureen o'hara's tough broad role, this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era. you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made, but it's still hard to get past. for all the heroism and gruesomely adult off-screen situations, this is still little more than an adolescent good time.

"against all flags" is every bit the classic swashbuckler. it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one, the damsel in distress is, well, not really in distress. as spitfire stevens, maureen o'hara is at her athletic best, running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period. anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke (flynn). for the classic adventure fan, "against all flags" is a must-see. while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn's earlier work (captain blood and the sea hawk, for instance), it is still a greatly entertaining romp.

excellent pirate entertainment! it has all the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue, a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens (maureen o'hara) who's attracted to the irresistible mr. hawke (errol flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!anthony quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs. macgregor, the protector of young princess patma (alice kelley).there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of errol flynn (robin hood on board ship!). from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.very enjoyable movie.

a fine effort for an australian show. which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama. dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way? no. but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us. the cast is great, gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen, the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters. but abe forsythe may be the saving light (not that it needs saving) if this show is to get another season. i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener. its also good to see brooke satchwell again. lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode.

tripping over. i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but having faith in the show, and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent, i continued to watch. i can safely say i'm now glad that i did. the story did develop quite well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most don't have any information missing.the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie.some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line. here's to hoping for another season!

finally we get a tv series where we get to see the acting talent! episode one was excellent! the script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the "i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!" rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many tv soaps do. the camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an "artistic" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant. it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity! thank you tony tilse, sam miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -wonderful work!! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!

i am going to go out on a limb, and actually defend "shades of grey" as a good clip-show episode, which delved into the life and death struggle of commander william thomas riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease.the scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as "11001001," "angel one," and "up the long ladder." tragic moments were highlighted such as tasha's death in "skin of evil," as well as elements of pulse-pounding danger in "heart of glory," "conspiracy," and the aforementioned "skin of evil." riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as "an ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once...after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." this episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of will riker under extreme duress. and, yes, i am biased in my opinion in proclaiming "shades of grey" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original airing, my face was covered in sweat, wondering whether or not riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great, galactic, outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier...of course, in subsequent years, i seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode...but, if an award should go for "the best clip-show episode in the history of television," then i believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect.

i am watching the series back to back as fast as possible. i am attempting to watch all things star trek. this is month 3 and i am now on season 3 of tng and i have already gone thru ds9 in its entirety. star trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved."shades of grey" is the first recap episode in the tng series. having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but i noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better. season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins.the show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in riker's life on the enterprise up until this point. the data and riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship. my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker's authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon. then the admiral kicks his a$$ but good. this entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a lot of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! at this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie riker to deanna troi as imzadi. up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it. let the record show that the st wiki - memory alpha claims that imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one. this episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come.here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/imzadi by this point in the series, production value is up to speed and star trek tng is settling into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to become. watching this again as an adult i see now what great actors the star trek universe provides. they really need to make a new st show set after all the current shows. a ds9 movie would have been nice too.

fragglerock is excellent in the way that schindler's list was excellent. a great watch for children and adults of all genders. big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols, in the same way that h.r. puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking. your kids will love this movie. i enjoyed it very much as a child. my father showed me this movie as a child. he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. although at the time i had no clue about what those were. the movie is comedy and adventure. the storyline is wacky and cheerful. i and you shall enjoy this together.

everything was better in past days. even children's television. and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily. at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can't resist the charm of fraggle rock. for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock (haha!), fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live-amazingly-in a rock. but they're not the only creatures. the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants. outside the rock on one side live inventor-scientist doc and his dog sprocket (who later befriends gobo fraggle), on the other side a family of gorgs-supposed rulers of the universe. the five main fraggles gobo (fearless leader), mokey (arty and peaceful), wembley (indecisive and a friend to gobo), boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and red (loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness)get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away.fraggle rock is definitely a family show-the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well, but the song-and-dance routines will hold their attention. the characters are strong and likable, their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling. the gorgs are frightening, doc and sprocket enlightening, uncle travelling matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80s!) and the final episode, change of address, genuinely touching. let's go down to fraggle rock again!

despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation, this is probably one of most uninspiring disney films i've seen, and i don't slam disney films very often. spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured, either by the cavalry or by indians, both of which try to "break" him. spirit ends up forming a bond with the indian, and that, in a nutshell, is the story. with exception to the beautiful animation of the horses, neither i or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film. it's ironic that it's titled "spirit", as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of. an extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was enjoyable, with songs by bryan adams and hans zimmer. and although this film is rated g, you will still probably have to end up explaining what "breaking a horse" means to your five year old. i did.

time for a rant, eh: i thought spirit was a great movie to watch. however, there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 (i'm being a little bit generous with the 7).point #1: matt damon aggravates me. i was thinking, 'what a dicky voice they got for the main character,' when i first heard him narrate - and then i realized it is matt damon. the man bugs me so very bad - his performance in "the departed" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that's another story for some other time), as it almost did "spirit". i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.point #2: brian adams sucks... the whole score was terrible... the songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did i find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. every time one of the lame songs came on, i was turned off. i almost thought i'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-american freedom style lyrics (i couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). in light of the native american aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. i thought i was back in junior high school. i can't believe no better could have been done--i refuse to. had it not have been for this, i'd rank the film up more with disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don't bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking ;). too bad, it's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians.i liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end). there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion. but there were also times when the emotion ran thick. anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.ok, i'm falling asleep here so i'll sum it up before i start making less sense...nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though. matt damon, you suck!

white man + progress + industrialization = bad. first nations + nature + animals = good. simple formula. actually, in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. however, that being said, i think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. you may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the west was won, er lost. but anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains. (the movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in america before the evil white man brought them there). anyway, i liked it. the quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.

i love horses and admire hand drawn animation, so i expected nothing short of amazement from dreamworks new animated picture spirit: stallion of the cimarron. i guess you could say i was a little bit disappointed. you have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story. a story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. the animals don't sing cute songs or even talk -- a major plus. sadly, the film has an uncalled for narration by matt damon; a sappy soundtrack by bryan adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a jerry bruckheimer production. if the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity, we'd have a masterpiece here. this is not a great film, but it is good entertainment for small children. i would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn't offensive to small children. not bad, but could have been much better. very pretty visuals though.

while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer, i was in for a deep surprise with this film. while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish,' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience. instead of the feel-good-happy-story, this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting, but also disturbing. most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film, which makes this film rather watchable for adults. i was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts. the musical score was once again solid, proving hans zimmer is the go-to guy when it comes to animated scores, and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams' music.

this animated movie is a masterpiece! the narration, music, animation, and storyline where all remarkable. my girlfriend and i saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it. we invited a couple friends to see spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot. when i asked them to come along to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but afterwards they realized it was more than that. i liked esperanza, spirit, rain, and lil' creek, who reminds me of nathan chasing horse who is smiles a lot in dances with wolves. spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that i found to be empowering and inspirational.i saw spirit for a third time and i want to go see it again. i enjoyed "spirit" tremendously because its portrayal of american indians is realistic, dignified, and non-stereotypical unlike the movie "the road to el dorado", which was a total farce because it portrayed american indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way. but dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making spirit a great movie that i found to be acceptable! i hope they continue to make more animated movies like spirit, and i would like to see sequels or spinoffs to spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping american indians.i highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see spirit: stallion of the cimarron.

this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways. everyone in my family enjoyed it. the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio.one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-cracking side kick for comedy relief. and, there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song. i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture: the birth of spirit. but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all. "spirit" was a great breath of fresh air. don't get me wrong. i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so. "spirit" is another example of great animated fare. as soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch it again. i had the same feeling. i thoroughly recommend it.

this is one of the most calming, relaxing, and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen. with beautiful music throughout the movie, the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! this movie is not just great for kids, but adults too. it teaches you lessons, such as never forget who you are, you can do whatever you stick your mind to, and to brave and daring. this movie can make you cry at times too, which is always a nice touch in movies. this movie is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them, and the movie "spirit" is definitely one of them! with my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a whole lot of spirit!

this movie was highly entertaining. the soundtrack (bian adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well. the score is also uplifting and dramatic.the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation, combined with computer generated images. the result is truly stunning. i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it. the story is compelling and well narrated.i don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. definately a keeper in my household.

i recently watched spirit and enjoyed it very much, i've seen it about 4 times now on hbo and will buy the dvd. those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `vanishing point' was just another car chase movie and `thelma & louise' was just another chick flick. although the conclusions of those films are darker i feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you. the other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else's home. all one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that.i thought the animation and the story were amazing, the animators really got the horses to look, act and move naturally. spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes i'm aware they do humanize the horses a bit, but this is fiction). in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire. in other more quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you're allowed to savor the backgrounds. one of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking, singing animals route. doing so would take away from the story's power. instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character, further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack. another plus is that they weren't afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side (which really made this film watchable to me). this isn't prevalent through the entire movie though, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy.those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but i think it's a bit more than a horse movie. i don't feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they're brought up on the inane fare that's offered up today. but if they're the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like the lord of the rings and black beauty they'll likely love this movie. hell, i'm 35 years old and still love that stuff.

this was a great movie with a good story. my children (10, 7, 5, and 4) all loved this movie, including myself. the music was also fantastic. no, the horses do not talk, but instead, the story is told by spirit. and to hear a story told by a horse's point if view was fun.i think the title says it all, "spirit". this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. i would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie, and even got so into it, they laughed so hard, and they cheered for spirit in the end. enjoy "spirit" with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story. your kids will love it. i think you will too.

i thought this movie would be dumb, but i really liked it. people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked. well, so what? the songs were good, and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human. i wouldn't care to own the movie, and i would love to see it again. 8/10

spirit: stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie. the blending of animation types is unique, the storyline is amazing, and the music is wonderful.the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations. how they expressed the characters, especially the horses, through their animation are spectacular especially. while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who haven't studied horses might not understand. without words, i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features. because of this, i understand the 'eyebrow' they added to the horses (while real horses don't have those thick lines). one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother's herd. in wild horse herds, the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out.also, while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys' is stereotyping, think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that. sometimes back then; they did treat mustangs very poorly. for example, in real history, the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers. imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them.i think it's amazing how the realism wasn't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other. spirit's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration, but mostly through the music (by bryan adams). the songs express the story really well, and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics.the emotion i got when watching the movie, whether the first time or the twentieth (yes, i've watched it that much), you wouldn't believe. some of the scenes take your breath away, while others seem to force tears into your eyes. the opening sequence, showing spirit's homeland, puts you right into the spectacular action right away.i don't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie. overall, i rate it a 10/10 - a must watch.

i began riding horses fairly recently, and, as anyone who has ever ridden should know, i fell in love with horses and their world. i rented spirit on a whim, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as i could, and i was surprised by the results.what i expected was a feel-good disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes.what i got was an amazing film, filled with beautiful scenery and animation, and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one's heart.spirit is a wild mustang in the old west, whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland. the story unfolds with a wide array of characters, some human, some animals, all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen.i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story, and who has an appreciation for history and animals.one thing i forgot to mention, but that i feel is important, is that the animals in this film do not talk. this was a really nice vacation from the lady and the tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to.

i really dislike both shrek films. (since their both "pg" and have words in them i would never say myself, so i disliked them.)but when it comes to "spirit: stallion of the cimarron," which i just barely watched for the first time last month, i became a fan of animated films, other than pixar. ***spoilers ahead*** in "spirit: stallion of the cimarron," a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard. one night, he sees a strange light in the distance, and he sets off toward it. this action eventually leads to his capture, and several more things. throughout the movie, we hear a narration. it's through the thoughts of spirit, though the horses never talk. this is what makes the movie so goo. they (the movie makers) recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made; none of those sounds were made by humans.spirit meets rain, a beautiful mare, and little creek, a native-american, who owns rain. little creek later frees spirit and rain, they go running home.i have never been a big fan of brian adams, but i intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future. watch this film, and you won't regret it. my score: 10/10

i liked this movie a lot. the animation was well done and the romance was cute. i liked most of bryan adams' songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent. what a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness/apocalypse now themes (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be "civilized" etc.). the opening scenery and music were very stirring. the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful.

the horse is indeed a fine animal. picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick.the animation is simply stupendous. the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick. more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain, jumps across cliffs and braves waters. soundtrack too is very impressive. the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie. "they say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse . " huh? well ,the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west .all in all, this movie is clearly up there with the best .it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched. would be a very fine choice on a lonely night. an easy 9/10.

well, what can i say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, i really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't. first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack (bryan adams), it really goes with the movie. second the simple story, and the drama of spirit gets your attention. one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but... i don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, i recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing.

if only all animation was this great. this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: story and character. the characters in this film are beautifully personified. i felt for all of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. the beautiful animation and 3-d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film. this is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 of 10.

i have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit. the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn't able to talk, this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10/10 from the kids and me

in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the "indomitable spirit". if you are feeling beaten down, this movie will free your mind and set you soaring. we all know how tough life can be, sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through. that's what this film did for me and i hope it will for you.

spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse, and native americans. the film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse, spirit, encounters during his life.very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism.the music is fantastic, with songs by bryan adams, and music by hans zimmer, who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 disney hit, the lion king.the story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in-depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a whole.an excellent film which i enjoyed immensely, and that is suitable for all the family. not one to be missed. (10/10)

since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept, but first some insider notes from a movie critic.this animated series is one of those that i grew up with, it made my childhood joyful, it made it awesome, miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don't see as much as we did back in the days, well on to the review...talespin, or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series, it is much like chip and dale, ducktales and a lot of those old ones, so it has that weird feeling surrounding it, i cannot remember this series as much as i would like to remember it.but in my opinion it was very great, it came with some kind of message, not that wild of a message, however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven.now i don't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons, today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that, we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that, yet i feel like that we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days.now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much, to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have some day, give them again...

i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. when i think about it, i only remember it vaguely. if you ask me, it was a good show. two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song. in addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. also, the writing was very strong. the performances were top-grade, too. i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

thanks jymn magon, for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever. this show has improved very much over the years. as a kid, i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip-off of ducktales, which was my favorite disney thing at the time (like grandmoffromero). then later on though it was good but not great. but after reading the reviews here, i decided to give it another chance & bought the dvd set & watched the whole pilot the first day i got it, & was very pleasantly surprised. it's still my favorite episode, although the series did live up to it. and by the end of disc 1, i knew this was going to be a top tenner.the characters are so complex & charming. my favorite has got to be wildcat. he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot. my next favorite is baloo, the best pilot on the show. i can see why 'ol jymn built the show around him. then it's kit cloudkicker. he & baloo have the best relationship in the series. after that, louie. jim cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice. after him, rebecca. she has made me laugh pretty hard, and i do believe she and baloo eventually marry. and finally(for the heroes), molly. although she's my least favorite, i still like her. i think she's a very cute character(much better than webby from ducktales). and the villains were very original. don karnage & his air pirates always crack me up, kahn is ice-cold and ruthless, and the thembrians are always at least amusing.as said before, the stories range from hilarious(time waits for no bear, romance of red chimp) to nothing short of touching(the old man & the seaduck, paradise lost), to fun, funny & exciting adventures(in search of ancient blunders & my favorite for whom the bell klangs). these are only a few of my favorite episodes. anyway, talespin is disney's best, aside from gummi bears some reasons for this? gb had a decent amount of my favorite character(cubbi), while ts didn't have enough of wildcat. but in the end talespin remains a classic. bottom line- 10/10 6th best cartoon ever.

in the year 1990, the world of disney tv cartoons was certainly at it's prime. shows like chip n dale rescue rangers, ducktales and gummi bears was already popular, and now disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the disney afternoon. that cartoon is called talespin. it's about old jungle book character baloo the bear as he gets a job in the plane business. in the series he meets kit cloudkicker, former air pirate and good cloud surfer, business lady rebecca cunningham and her hyperactive daughter molly. this series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life. this is one cleverly written series and it's great to add to your dvd collection. parents, buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible nickelodeon cartoons. if you liked talespin, then check out "darkwing duck" and "goof troop". spin it!

ahh, talespin! what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show? nothing! this is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows i've ever encountered, live-action or animation. the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the "mature" stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for. but not talespin.the stories are engaging and very plausible. some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie. episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays(at least, those which aren't specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. in the episode stormy weather for instance, kit cloudkicker decides that he's going to join an air circus, but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous. in the biggest fight of the episode, baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan, to which kit screams "no! you can't tell me what to do! your're *not* *my* *dad*!" and buries his face in his pillow. the next day he leaves for the air circus. this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.the characters have a lot of depth to them. baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. molly is a cute little girl, but you can't let that deceive you. she can be a real hellion sometimes. kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a pirate.in the end, it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show #1 in my book. the relationship between baloo and kit is very real, almost father and son. this is demonstrated well in all's whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit's word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults. baloo and becky's relationship is also realistic, due to baloo's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol' sea duck, not necessarily a desire to help rebecca. but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he'd still do jobs for rebecca.the sea duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. the plane's functions don't change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other "super-planes" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on it's cunning pilot's great skill to get out of trouble. it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. plus it's just such a darn cool design!this is definitely the best cartoon. ever. period. definitely worth all ten stars!

ever since i remember, i have loved airplanes and flying. i am now in college with a private pilot's license and looking to become a commercial. i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me, this was it. my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid. i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re-cite it today. it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the dvd's soon! it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless. i cannot get enough of this show.

along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled. disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track. ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo (sounds familiar?) the theme theme tune is also catchy. out of all the villains, which are all great on their own merits, tony jay stands out as shere kahn. louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book, which isn't a bad thing at all. as a matter of fact, it's quite inspirational! the animation was spot on, and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years. please bring this show back! 9/10. bethany cox

as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood, i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters.to class this work of art as a "cartoon" could never do talespin justice, in fact it's an insult to class it as a "cartoon", talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date, when disney "pulled" it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since.i'll take a moment to explain, from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck, disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since, they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey's for the story's, i couldn't have my children watching the mind-numbing "cartoons" they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50% of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it, i couldn't let that happen, which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a harddrive so one day my children couldn't be corrupted by the "cartoon crap" of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin.talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth, charm, wit, compassion, emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today, do you see any of that content in say "ed, edd and eddie or anything else you can think of?, the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso.the next time you watch an episode of talespin; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation, even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again, the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted, even the vehicles are true to life, ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail.the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the "deliberate mistakes" or "intended mistakes" in each episode and some have two, for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say's "you're up to something baloo" and baloo replies "who, me!, i'm as innocent as a schoolboy" take a look into rebecca's eyes, i won't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time.everyone elses comment's are bang on and 100% correct, i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here, disney, wake up and smell the coffee, you have been asleep for over a decade, stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing "cartoons", we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible.

"spin it!"the 90s opened up with a clever disney favorite, "talespin," the tv cartoon series that featured characters from "the jungle book." join baloo and kit cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before: out of cape suzette, to louie's, up mountains, through jungles, on water, in volcanoes, looking for adventure, looking for treasure, looking for fun, all in one action-packed cartoon adventure!!!!!this was a favorite of mine as well as my family's. this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in 1995, which i have seen on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in march 1997.and good news: today the dvds are here!!!!! relive the fun and excitement of "dun, dun, dun, talespin!!!!!"10/10

if you are viewing this show for the first time, you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality. colorful and imaginative characters? entertaining dialogue? plots that seem to have some depth to them, even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times? i mean, this is a syndicated children's show right? this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as "pokemon", "pepper ann", "mighty morphin power rangers", and "vr troopers" (please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports, courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment). don't worry, you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's. some examples of this period would be "transformers", "garfield and friends", "captain power", and "c.o.p.s." (a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox). besides these prime examples, disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids, coming up with a lineup called "the disney afternoon". aside from a dumbed-down show called "the gummi bears", early shows like "darkwing duck", "duck tales", and "chip 'n dale's rescue rangers" gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like "the little mermaid", "beauty and the beast", "the rescuers down under", and "the great mouse detective". but above all these wonders shines "talespin". the premiere of "plunder and lightning" was a two-hour thrill ride, and won an emmy. much to my delight, the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere.while i enjoy the plots and dialogue, i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters. there's rebecca cunningham, an independent female, but still fallible; kit cloudkicker, full of pre-teen angst and optimism; louie, with his loyalty and support; frank wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original "star trek"; molly cunningham, cute and witty, but with some depth that most child characters don't have, and of course in the middle of it all, there's baloo, whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond. this is because whenever there's trouble, baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker-than-most, fastest-of-all sea duck (read: james bond's aston martin). of course every great show has to have great villains, and talespin doesn't disappoint here either. from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn, to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage, to the hilarious and inept soviet-satirized thembrians. the animation is good, the music appropriate, and the episodes are (for me) the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer. great fun for the whole family!

this movie is great, the music "with the exception of the very first song in the movie" was awesome. the story line is awesome too, it's just basically a wonderfull movie, for all ages. i found the last battle scene awesome! basically this was a great flick!

still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it, in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset. despite it's non-association with the original (which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about), this is what cartoons *should* be like. just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing. the music is great, and gets stuck in your head forever...i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.

every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. this was that movie for me. i can tell you the whole plot exactly, i must have seen it 100 times at least, and i can say it is a good kids/family movie.i still have the tape, i haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe i'll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day. you just have to love the care bears, and their messege.

in an era of such awful cartoons, i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies.this movie does contradict the first. i won't deny that. however, when i was in the target age group for this movie, i didn't even notice, nor would it have mattered if i did. the people who made it may have used "new generation" to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began. perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began.this was my favorite movie at age 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all.

and my children love it now! granted, i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great, and that the plot is trite. hey, if every villian introduced themselves by saying "i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt" i think they might be laughed at, but for young children it is a moral story with catchy music.music so catchy, mind you, that i still had the words memorized after not seeing this film in twenty years. i would definitely suggest this one for younger children.

i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care-a-lot. now, after so many years have passed, i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children, then you should, just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care-a-lot! the songs, especially "forever young" are very sweet and memorable. parents, i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be! when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv, you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these.

care bears movie 2: a new generation isn't at all a bad movie. in fact, i like it very much. yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times. but darkheart, while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain, and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him. speaking of the voice acting, it was great, nothing wrong with it whatsoever. the animation is colourful, and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking. the songs and score are lovely, especially growing up and forever young, the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two. the care bears, who i do like, are adorable, and the human children are well done too. and the ending is a real tearjerker. all in all, harmless kiddie fun. 8/10 bethany cox

this movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the care bears and the care bear cousins goes. i won't deny that. however, if you look at "part ii" as a separate film, then it's a very good movie. i remember watching this in the early 80's (and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then), and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie (not that i didn't enjoy that one too, it's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it). sure it's darker than the first one too, but perhaps maybe that's why it's so good. and it's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too (that kids may not fully understand, but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off, and adults watching will surely get quicker as i have now watching this film again now in my mid-twenties) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit/demon in exchange for something else. get the picture? but simply watching that as a child, sure as i said it may have been a little scary, but nothing traumatizing. in fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game i could play when i was that age. i can't tell you the number of times i used to pretend dark heart wanted to imprison me, have me help him capture the care bears, tried to make me turn over to his dark side, and other things like that etc. so this movie was also good for my imagination. and it's also got great emotional depth to it too. i used to watch it at least once a week.also hadley kay was the perfect choice for the voice of dark heart (i always thought so and i always will).now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available. sometimes i just want to hear growing up without watching the movie, as good as it is."what good is love and caring if it can't save her?"

it all started with true heart bear & noble heart horse get the club to safety. noble heart horse meet dawn & john & took them to see true heart bear. later, the care meter went down more & true heart bear & noble heart horse check to see if it dark heart but they can't go unless the club at care for so they ask dawn & john to care for the club. after true heart bear & noble heart horse come back, they send dawn & john back to camp. than the club & cousin bears have grown up to get ready to fight dark heart. at the end, dark heart kidnap all the care bear & the kids (dawn & john) have to tell christy that dark heart is evil. than they work to together to save the care bears. later, true heart bear & noble heart horse found out it dark heart shadow & return to care land to find that their gone. the kids (dawn, john, & christy) come but they was not powerful to stop dark heart. true heart bear & noble heart horse come to help dawn, john, & christy to free the other care bears but christy got in the way & was hit by dark heart magic. than dark heart saw christy got hit & stop fighting the care bear in order to help her but he can't because dark heart (himself) don't have the power of caring to save christy. the care bears & the kids help dark heart save christy. now dark heart starting to care & became a real boy to fall in love with christy. dark heart is now a real boy & help out christy to work out in camp.this is a great move ever & the best care bears movie i ever seeing.i like all the care bears movies & i can't wait to see "care bears: big wish movie (2005)".who like this movie?

this is my favorite of the three care bears movies. once again i liked all the songs. the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original. for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their "cousins" who they apparently never knew about. it wasn't of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared. in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along. that being said this isn't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first. i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the first. but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears. i also liked the we care part at the end, although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene. and of course i loved the songs. my favorites being growing up and forever young. the care bears movies have always had such good songs. ten stars for a very good movie.

as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark. i always sat down and watched the first one. as i got older i learned to prefer this one. what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants, but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more, it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child.this movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is so much deeper. it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. the cubs are just too adorable, i rewind that 'flying my colors' scene. i tend to annoy everyone by singing it.the sound track is great! a big hand to carol and dean parks. i love every song in this movie, i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to, i'm listening to 'our beginning' also known as 'recalling' at the moment. i have always preferred this sound track to the first one, although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie 'care-a-lot'.i think the animation is great, the animation in both movies are fantastic. i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent. it was really surprising.there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. i do not think it is weird/strange. i think it is a wonderful movie.basically, this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon, dark heart. the end is surprising and again, beats any 'pokemon movie' with the care bears moral issues. it leaves an effect on you. again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.

i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea. i think the "dark-heart" character is a little on the rough side and i don't like the way he shape-shifts into a "mean" frog, fox, boy i was wrong, this movie was made for my kid, not for me. she "gets it" when it went over (under?) my head. of course i don't "get it". this isn't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy. this is straight for the young ones, and the crew knew what they were doing. there isn't any political junk ether. there's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves, nobody has the right to access excess, and everyone isn't happy all the time. and as a side benefit, nobody dies! russwill.

this cartoon was strange, but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies. we have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends, except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is. she reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil-like demon. i found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn't be worse, the girl sees what she's done, she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark, mystical creature learn the human quality of love. the twins improve too, by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too. a very positive message for children, though some elements of the film was strange, it was and still is a rather enjoyable film. the music from stephen bishop (tootsie songs) made the film even better

the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor. it has a deeper plot, better character development, and the tunes (especially the closing song) are both catchy and warm-hearted. sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on, it is a care bears movie. this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship, love, and again, caring. not to mention the care bears are just too adorable!

origins of the care bears & their cousins. if you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. the cousins are raised with the care bears, rather than meeting them later. however i have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. the babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. my favourite is swift heart rabbit. the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either. cree summer is excellent as christy. the songs are sweet and memorable. if you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10

for the longest time, i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie. well last summer, i watched them both together and decided i was wrong. the first one is a better care bears movie (as you may have guessed if you read my review for it). this one isn't a bad movie, it's just... very strange.well first of all, as a few people have mentioned, it completely disavows any knowledge of the first movie. i can't think of another sequel that contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the genders of some characters and how they all met). when i was little and watching this, i was quite a bit confused and distraught. i felt the same way watching it as an adult!on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good (if you disassociate it from the first movie). i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's villan! now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and care bears are good, i just find it cool that there's a supremely evil being in a movie for little kids! it's like that bizzare "santa clause vs. satan" movie from mexico you hear about sometimes. anyhow, the demon's name is darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers. very dark for a kiddy flick eh? and did i mention that darkheart appears to the girl most often as a whiney voiced 10 year old boy??? freaky! meanwhile some other kids are in care-a-lot looking after baby care bears! oh, man! demons and baby care bears in the same movie!!!!!needless to say, everything gets cleared up in the end (but not before we get to see darkheart trap the care bears' souls in this scary chandelere thing in one [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). but i am left with the question of wether this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves. i might just watch it again myself.

i like the good and evil battle. i liked eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. he wasn't the smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays. he shows heart and a more humble humor. the fact that it shows there are stranger things in heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope.

very funny film. classic film funny eddie murphy of the 80s. i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory. the classic irony of murphy does not fail, the film is funny, well done. murphy in the'80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous. the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed. the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period. a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy, an actor who has recently disappeared. the final part is anthologies, the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk. that's it.

a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career. while there is a lot of the "eddie murphy character," he plays a truly decent person. the rest of the cast is good, particularly the lovely charlotte lewis. her character's beauty and serenity held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy.

i grew up watching this movie ,and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. don't listen to the critic reviews. they are not accurate on this film.eddie murphy really shines in his roll.you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.i recommend this movie to everybody to see. it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.with demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with god like powers.this movie takes you from l.a. to tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet.just a beautiful view! so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! you wont regret it!

this movie was good for it's time. if you like eddie murpy this is a must have to add to your collection. eddie was young and funny with his 80's haircut. charlotte lewis, eddie's costar is hot. this was one of her first movies and she was not bad. the graphics were good for the 80's. a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb. other must have from eddie is "coming to america" and "48 hours". another actor "victor wong" has a small part in this movie. check out some of his older movies like "big trouble in little china". if you liked the action movies from the 80's this is your movie.

eddie murphy spends his time looking for lost children, so when a very special magical child is kidnapped in tibet, the sexy charlotte lewis asks for his help to rescue this child from the clutches of evil itself.although the story is a bit silly, it never quite feels corny, despite the hilarity of the comedy throughout the film; charles dance off-sets the comedy with his very serious and dark characterisation of the evil that holds the child hostage.the golden child is very funny, action packed and really quite compelling in a charming, almost magical way.7/10 great for all generations.

this was a highly original decent movie, and a brave move for all those involved. i don't care if it's not the most well put-together movie of all time, the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic, and that i don't know what will happen next, makes it a favorite of mine. i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.

while this movie has many flaws, it is in fact a fun '80s movie. eddie murphy peaks during his 80's movies here. while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies, his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foils.couple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis, this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick.

i think the movie was pretty good, will add it to my "clasic collection" after all this time. i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie. maybe some of the more esoteric points defy "logic", but a great many religious matters accepted "on faith" fail to pass the smell test. if you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie. is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja-yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in "the shadow". no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here (imdb), but i would bet a dollar to a donut it's the same prop.

eddie murphy plays chandler jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. when the beautiful kee nang {charlotte lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the golden child. sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon sardo numspa.is the golden child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was eddie murphy and the golden child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. for i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to deny eddie murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. the golden child is not up with the more accepted 80s murphy pictures like trading places and beverly hills cop, but upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains murphy at his wisecracking, quipping and charming best!, seriously!.cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by raiders of the lost ark in 1981, the golden child hits all the required genre buttons. pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {charles dance so english i could kiss him myself}, wonderful colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the fun, not to dissect and digress its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. yes the cgi demon looks creaky now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 7/10

this movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality. other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor. it has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes.as a finder of lost children, murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the golden child. the young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector.also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts. one such scene is where the golden child, that murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple. an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice.this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware. as we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us.this is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting, and eddie murphy humor.

i love this film. it is well written and acted and has good cinematography. the story blends action, humor, mysticism, and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. see it, buy it, show it to your friends.the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero. i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions.i cared what happened to these people and, while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming?), it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end. thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel. grab some popcorn, cuddle up on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining film.

every once in a while, eddie murphy will surprise you.in a movie like "the golden child", especially. this is a movie you'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone. but eddie really does work; he's smart, he's funny, he's brave, kind, courteous, thrifty, clean and everything else a hero should be.having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil (embodied perfectly by dance), eddie goes from california, to nepal and back, all while the beautiful kee nang (lewis) wonders if he's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man (wong, perfect as always) knows that he is.it's exciting, breathtaking in spots, shocking and, of course, funny. eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about ed mcmahon.no problem with this "child": it's a "golden" find.nine stars. viva nepal!

i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it. charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine. his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero. i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner: a bit of "axel foley through the looking glass". charlotte lewis is, to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable, luminously gorgeous. some scenes are wonderfully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the climactic confrontation. through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp. like that movie we have james hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, however short, raise the quality even of derek. since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "the golden child" is silly; it is not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy, well worth watching. after four years i have seen "the golden child" again; i enjoyed it even more! it truly is great fun.

whenever i see most reviews it's called 'a misfire for eddie murphy'. these critics want to take a look at some of the stuff he's doing these days, and maybe soften their stance in retrospect... "the golden child" is not highbrow entertainment, but thanks to some of the cast it breaths new life into old clichés, and gives murphy one of his best roles. i don't understand the pervading lack of 'love' for its efforts, at all. perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment had grown weary of knockabout, thrill-a-minute adventures? steven spielberg started it with indiana jones; it's unfair to make this one a scapegoat when what is possibly its biggest sin is also utterly harmless. there's nothing necessarily wrong with trying to capitalise on trends.yes it's silly, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that 'ridiculous' is where hollywood's idea of mysticism begins and ends. what's more important than believability with a story like this is that the audience have entertaining tour guides on hand to show them the mysterious sights. michael ritchie and eddie murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine. my advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.

this movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it's kind. the interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen. it treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies. the sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. no such scenes are present or needed. the argument is sand honest to the spectator; an important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience. no, this is not miss marble... a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savor every minute, not just to see.

short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men. one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses. later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays. hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival (during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids, so it is really serious). with exposed, well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women. one gets caught, the other remains free and is not given away by his companion. a last encounter, a last light for a cigarette, adieu l'ami, farewell, friend.i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters, played by classical he-man superstars alain delon and charles bronson. they are obviously attracted to each other, their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout. the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow, a little like deliverance. it is also very stylish. the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. it is the seat of a publicity firm, so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. the wardrobe is also very good. the ultra stylish citroen ds (maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.i can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone. delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing, in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting. both do a considerable amount of acrobatics. i have never seen bronson better than here, he really acts - and speaks french throughout, with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed. and it is certainly the man himself we hear. (so the french language version is highly recommended). the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors, bernard fresson who was gene hackman's partner in french connection ii. he is the best brainy police inspector i know. also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who, as it turns out, is not so innocent as it first seems.anyone who expects the old in-an-out" of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience, full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks, although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.

utterly tactical, strange (watch for the kinky moment of a drop-dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull-string doll for some rich folks), pointless but undoubtedly compelling late-night feature. this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars (if somewhat anti-heroes) alain delon and charles bronson. really they don't get to do all that much, especially during the confined, lengthy mid-section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with 10,000 possible combinations. oh fun! but this is when the odd, if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronson's characters. after a manipulative battle of wills (and childishly sly games against each other), the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect. this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve-ball. still their encounters early on suggest there's more, but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that 'what just happen there?' ending that might just make you jump. yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh! glad to get that out of the system. the pacing is terribly slow, but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy, nervous underlining tension. watch as the same process is repeated over and over again, and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play. now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous, but the climax payoff is haunting. the taut, complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good, but there are some neat novelties (coins, glass and liquids try not spilling) and visual symbolisms. jean herman's direction is efficiently sophisticated and low-key, but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere. the sound fx features more as a potent note, than that of francois deroubaix's funky score that's mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening. top drawers delon (who's quite steely) and bronson (a jovial turn) are solid, and work off each tremendously. bernard fresson chalks up the attitude as the inspector who knows there's more going on than what is being led on. an attractive female cast features able support by brigitte fossey and olga georges-picot. a cryptically directionless, but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions.

this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind. the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen. it treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies. the sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. no such scenes are present or needed. the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator, wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience. no, this is not miss marble... a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute, not just to see.

the premise may seem goofy, but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. excellent cast, particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis, and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action. there's also some great f/x, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot. often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.

farewell friend aka adieu l'ami/honour among thieves isn't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault, one to return stolen bonds, the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend. naturally things aren't quite that simple even after they open the vault, leading to some neat twists and turns. on the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park, bronson has a very irritating fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments, brigitte fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s (it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind), is something of a liability  her "i'll cook spaghetti! i'll learn to make love well! i'll read shakespeare!" speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and it's a shame about the horrible last line/shot, but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent print.cinema club's uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack, but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that's no great problem, especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality.

a clever script from the late sebastian japrisot and smart performances from the two male leads - alain delon and charles bronson (or should it be the other way around) result in an engaging and entertaining thriller.add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by francois de roubaix, it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality.this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners, both disillusioned and world weary, returning, presumably from algiers. like the other colonial powers of this time (post ww ii leading into the 60s), france had struggled to keep up appearances overseas. losing algiers was a bitter blow.adieu l'ami (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to make a go of it, after their discharge.one thing happens after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because japrisot is lean and economical with his script: if it is there, then there must be a reason.suffice to say, these two men battle it out, physically and psychologically, one long weekend. their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. that alain delon and charles bronson are outwardly so different - the former, arguably a pretty boy, and the latter an ugly thug, adds to the chemistry.that quest makes for a great story, which in turn, makes for a great film.lest i forget there are women in this film, and true to the japrisot method, they too are memorable, though not nearly as fleshed out; to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature.farewell, friend has been released in the uk; an anamorphic image, 16.9 enhanced; in english only (not even subtitles for the hard of hearing); a running time of 110 minutes; mono soundtrack but the de roubaix music has lots of punch! highly recommended.

i loved this movie. i totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that i've read over the years. this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy! he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! and, it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr. murphy's great comedic style. you have to keep in mind that 'golden child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. during the time this film was released, i was working in a video rental store. this was one of the most popular with all our customers. every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, all the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! everyone who rented it loved it! i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them. i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (yes, i did buy this film for my own video library!). i adored the little boy who played the 'golden child'  j. l. reate - but after looking at his profile in imdb, i noticed that he never did any more films. that is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. i also adored victor wong, who played the old man (i loved him in his part as 'egg shen' in 'big trouble in little china' - 1986). at any rate, this was a great film. the only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. it was funny, but it still was out of sync. ok, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood. now that's entertainment!

"the golden child" was eddie murphy's first film since his megahit "beverly hills cop". and even though it's not as good as "cop", it's a fun comic adventure. murphy stars as a finder of lost children who's assigned a most unusual case. his assignment: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. this movie could have been titled "beverly hills cop and the temple of doom" since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure, kinda like an indiana jones comedy. it's got comedy with laughs, and adventure with special effects. lots of fun.*** (out of four)

i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's - i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video (finally it's out). it was made in brazil, so i assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet. i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out! it is one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it is weird, like werner herzog weird - its weirdness stems from its super-realism.the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when europeans were first encountering the tribes in the amazon. a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they intend to kill him. before they dispatch him, though, they make him part of their tribe (their custom). the entire movie is like watching a national geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe. that's it. cosmic plotline? no. intense insight into the variety of human life? definitely.oh yeah... be warned... this film has definite nudity - this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble savages... this film tells it like it was (re-read above: national geographic, super-realism)

how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming. it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen, even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldn't. utlimately, this is the film's greatest strength: it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you. i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid-'90s. it is not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for.

without "mental anachronism", this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the "disenchantment of the world". that, there is thirty years, a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding. it would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood, analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of "primitive thought". because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior, that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance. if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance.

i grew up in brazil and i used to visit and marvel at the beautiful coast where the movie was filmed. the area is called "parati" and is part of the "green coast" of the rio de janeiro state. it is some 150 miles from the rio de janeiro city.this movie brings back to life the world of 16th century brazil, where europeans were barely starting to explore the coastline, which was still in pristine state and sparsely populated by various native tribes. french and portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper hand on the brazil wood trade, all the while negotiating with the natives, who also fought each other for whatever reasons.one french misfit ("a mercenary") is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is kept prisoner by an all-naked native tribe. while he is a "slave" of the chief, according to the customs of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge.what i love about this film is that it recreates in loving detail the natives' villages and their way-of-life (they walked naked and were cannibals) and asks us to recognize and accept the life in those times as it was: in a gorgeous garden-of-eden, life was messy, violent, full of pathetic superstition and bizarre customs. the europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. there is no romanticized "noble savages" or "heroic explorers" here, it is just people trying to survive in a tough world.the movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives. from what i know of the subject, the depiction is fairly accurate which adds an air of uniqueness to the project: how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of brazilian natives and their early affairs with europeans?

i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy, however that is not to say it wasn't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear. it's set in 16th century brazil, where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance. what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french. the hero is a likable frenchman, the portuguese are barbarians, and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy. the film's portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done, we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes. it's about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes. enemies are made and perpetuated, and like so, the environmental integration never progresses.a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe, the tupinambas, after they massacre a group of portuguese. the tribe's shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief's brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball. thinking the frenchman is portuguese, they believe they now have one. nevertheless, the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village, is sooner or later given a wife, and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes, or any clothes. another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese, then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearby.i found the opening scene funny, because its narration apposed with its contradictions on- screen serve as great satire, even if the movie didn't seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often. it's actually not a terribly riveting film. the bountiful, essential locale, fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman, but us, too, forget any threat, and we have the feeling of him as a free man. it should not be that terribly hard to escape. the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the full-frontal nudity of the cast, suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santos's dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence. at any rate, this 1500s-era social commentary, shot on location at a bay with 365 islands, played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi, encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because they've repeated themselves for centuries.

in 1594 in brazil, the tupinambas indians are friends of the frenches and their enemies are the tupiniquins, friends of the portugueses. a frenchman (arduíno colassanti) is captured by the tupinambás, and in spite of his trial to convince them that he is french, they believe he is portuguese. the frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with seboipepe (ana maria magalhães). later, he uses powder in the cannons that the portuguese left behind to defeat the tupiniquins in a battle. in order to celebrate the victory, the indians decide to eat him. "como era gostoso o meu francês" is another great low budget movie of the great brazilian director nélson pereira dos santos. the screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in tupi. the film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic. the actors and actresses perform naked and ana maria magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance. the sound is produced by the brazilian musician zé rodrix. this movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by europeans, focusing in the portuguese and french at that time, trading with the indians and exchanging combs and mirrors by our natural resources. this movie was awarded in the national festivals, such as the 1971 brazilian cinema festival of brasília (festival de brazília do cinema brasileiro) with best screenplay (nelson pereira dos santos), best dialog (nelson pereira dos santos and humberto mauro) and best cenograph (régis monteiro); art critics association of são paulo (associação paulista dos críticos de arte), with best revelation of the year (ana maria magalhães) and some other prizes. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "como era gostoso o meu francês" ("how tasty was my frenchman")

"the day time ended" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story doesn't make sense. but that only makes it all the more intriguing. like many of the best works of art, "the day time ended" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" european films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)

the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. director john "bud" cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger, crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds. moreover, cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder. the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams, dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana, christopher mitchum as the concerned richard, marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth, natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny, and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve. the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. richard band's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot. john arthur morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. a fun flick.

if you love cult 70's sci-fi the way i do, or if you like movies such as "repo man" or "buckaroo bonzai" than you're going to love this one. it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now. this movie is pure 70's. put on steve miller's "fly like an eagle" or pink floyd's "dark side of the moon" and you're ready to go!

considering it was made on a low budget, the day time ended manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.the story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the mojave desert in southwestern california, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. but their youngest daughter (natasha ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. and only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. thus the family, led by jim davis and dorothy malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.mixing in elements of 2001: a space odyssey and close encounters of the third kind, the day time ended, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of david allen. the desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either kubrick's or spielberg's films, the day time ended is much better than many other 2001/close encounters knock-offs. i give credit to director john 'bud' cardos, whose 1977 thriller kingdom of the spiders made for an interesting precursor to arachnophobia, for at least trying--and on that basis, i give the day time ended a 7 out of 10.

bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family, living in the california desert. they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, a friendly and tiny little e.t. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. this picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.very nice music by richard band, engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen, randall william cook, and peter kuran, and, importantly, a likable family are key assets. it generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.i found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director john "bud" cardos (of "kingdom of the spiders" fame) and executive producer charles band.7/10

probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'shore leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on too long and others are unambitiously cut short, but one can't deny they threw in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this an entertaining episode. kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for shore leave after an extended tour of duty has left everyone on board in need of rest, relaxation and so on. it appears for all intents and purposes to be an uninhabited earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. the first indication that things might go just a little awry is when mccoy, leading an advance team, spots alice (from wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters. the one thing they all have in common is that each crew member was thinking about the person/place/thing they discovered right before they discovered it. this doesn't immediately sink in with kirk or anyone else. more strangeness ensues, including sightings of don juan, a siberian tiger, a ww2 fighter plane, etc; kirk meets up with ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from his academy days, finnegan. the chase/fight scene with finnegan goes on too long but at the same time, mccoy is run through with a lance by a knight on horseback and apparently killed. finally, an elderly man appears and explains what has been happening. the planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have only to imagine something to have it appear. nothing is permanent; mccoy isn't really dead. once this is explained, kirk decides to order shore leave for everyone after all. despite the 'it was all a dream' sort of ending, 'shore leave' holds up as another first-rate episode of star trek's first season.

i watched shore leave the other day. i've seen it so many times, and i never get tired of it. strangely enough, every time i watch it lately, it takes me right back to the very first time i saw it. including this time. must be that sense of mystery and "what is going on here?" about it.oddly enough, the one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me, this time, actually had a huge effect on me-- ruth. i think a lot of it was gerald fried's score. a real masterpiece, that! the romantic section was reused-- much more extensively-- in this side of paradise. but of course, it debuted here. i get the impression that, out of all the girls kirk knew over the years, she may have been the "sweetest". when she said, "do you have to go?", combined with the music, i could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her.someone commented online that ruth looked older than he was, yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years. which makes me think... maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy. kirk had an affair with an older woman! (perhaps he thought back to this in "miri" when he told janice, "i never get involved with older women." maybe he meant, "...anymore."reading st reviews the other day, i see where someone compared what are little girls made of? with i, mudd. but it seems shore leave oughta be in there, too. what are all those "people" if not androids? and could "the caretaker" be related to "the old ones" from the earlier episode? whoever he is, he seems to be one of the rare cases in st where you have a race that is actually "superior" as opposed to merely thinking they are.yeoman barrows seems to be filling in for yeoman rand. considering how much attention dr. mccoy showered on her, it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again! sheesh.one thing missing from the last several i've watched that snuck back in here was, spock smiling. he was! i saw him. i really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time, rather than this "submerged" business. when he said, "enjoy yourself, sir." near the beginning, you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer, but talking to his friend. and at the end, when he needlessly says, "totally illogical!", i can't help but think he does it purely to provoke a reaction. he may not be smiling or laughing, but i think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy.

this one's a romp; many trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones, but this one is so well executed for what it is, so successful as pure entertainment, it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes, no matter what mood i'm in. several well known future movies ("westworld") and tv shows (the more bland "fantasy island") took their cue from the premise of this episode (then, of course, the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology). beautifully filmed (especially evident in the restored version and on dvd) and directed, it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to. it's odd that no animal life, even insects, seems to exist here (how are flowers pollinated, for example), but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past (kirk has a people-heavy past, it turns out), as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories. sulu even finds an old-style police revolver (adding to his collection of swords, no doubt).by this point in the trek series (halfway thru the first season), the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we'd come to know over the many proceeding years. here, we get to really see them relax, converse and work together to figure out this episode's puzzle: the strong narrative is a mystery again, of sorts, and the audience is along for the ride as kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them. it's almost whimsical, following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue (the enterprise had, it's suggested, just completed a harrowing mission). then dr. mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback; yes, this is dr. mccoy's final episode...just kidding. but, it's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story. mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and, like the best trek episodes, the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic, more desperate tempo of action and suspense. this is all signaled by kirk's resolute response to sulu, who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy's death - kirk will get to the bottom of all this, come what may.but, it doesn't get much easier for kirk: what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days, a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet. yet, this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness, with another of kirk's past acquaintances. this episode runs the gamut of all human experience, rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet. it's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what's happened, as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines (unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there). and there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to 'work' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion, or we just don't function in a 'normal' natural way. also, note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand, who did not return until the first trek movie in '79. i believe that after this episode, even more trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters. but i leave this episode with a final, perhaps tantalizing thought: if mccoy was killed (verified by spock), how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship? perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data.

probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the superb balance of terror) with a lighter affair, shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci-fi, and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry (the true triumph is trouble with tribbles, in season 2), the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness.diverting from the show's tradition, the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode. instead, kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty: a well deserved break after three months of incessant work. the earth-like planet (a budget-related fact) is very appealing, but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens: dr. mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis carroll's work. soon, other people begin experiencing similar things: a woman meets a don juan-like character, sulu has a run-in with a samurai, and kirk faces a double encounter with the past, in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy. throw in a freakishly real-looking tiger, and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt.the idea is a classic one: idyllic place turns out to be far from heavenly. the episode's humorous take on the topic is rather successful, weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest (of course, everything works out fine again come the end) and the cast's general unwillingness to show a funnier side of themselves (most notably, and ironically, the otherwise hilarious william shatner). and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of star trek's success.7,5/10

"shore leave" is mostly an average star trek adventure. nothing wrong with the episode, though. i simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans. it is lightweight entertaining, nothing more. however, i'm glad to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts. in this episode, kirk decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. as usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be. there are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughs. good, but unexceptional.

another episode from childhood that, as an adult, i look back on with a different perspective. this was one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my adoration of this show. however, on viewing this episode after 20 years, i'd say it is definitely one of the lighter ones, played for laughs and amusement, instead of the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in previous episodes in this, their first and best season. perhaps this episode was written for a little fan r&r too! as mr. spock would say, the story just isn't logical but there are some amusing lines like, of course, mr. spock's final one at the end--when he asks the captain, mccoy et al whether they enjoyed their r&r and they answer in the affirmative, he raises an eyebrow and says "fascinating..." in only the way mr. spock could do that. an interesting story line, of course, the idea of an amusement park being actually amusing (instead of the fake and often annoying "amusement" of disneyland, for example), being able to have one's wishes actually come true. really, a great idea but not that well executed. and coming from theodore sturgeon, another of the great sf short story writers they used in the first season, one wonders how much tinkering was done to the script that sturgeon turned in.now, here is a little trivia i learned on this very site: in 1987, james gunn established the theodore sturgeon award for best short science fiction story. and i'll quote the rest from this site: in 1968 he {sturgeon} wrote "the joy machine", a third script for the star trek tv series {amok time the other}, that was never shot. the main reason that it wasn't used in the series is that it contained expensive special effects sequences that would be too much for their budget. however, the script was adapted into a book by sci-fi writer james gunn (star trek #80, the original series) and published by pocket books in 1996.i'd sum this up to say this episode is still very enjoyable, especially if one doesn't think too much about it. just laugh and enjoy it and next episode we can get back to the serious stuff of protecting the universe.

this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun. but, i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. think about it--the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland, a bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a knight on horseback who kills mccoy, and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end. despite all the danger, you just can't take everything very seriously--it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. so, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great stuff.

bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. shore leave is really tos' first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with tribbles). it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, the corbomite manouever.looking for a place to chill out for a while, the enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic m class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (mccoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).tos was the least serialized of all of the series in the trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. unlike later series franchise writers, tos' production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before. and shore leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. my only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn't seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on st's themes. the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire tos run - both compositionally and in terms of acting.'nuff said. my recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order.

this particular episode of smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion. this is for many reasons. for example, it takes the series back to some of it's roots. it welcomes back lionel from a supposedly long absence, with the luthorcorp plaza office in metropolis. this room hasn't been in smallville for a very long time, and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville's past. not to mention, lionels conversations with lex are always admirable.another pleasant return is, well uv guessed it, is bart allen(aka impulse), ac(aka aquaman) and victor stone(aka cyborg). not only does steven deknight reunite the former justice leaguers, he blends them in with the smallville formula in such a unique way, that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie.from there you get the basic story, green arrow forms the league, attempts to blow up 33.1, bart gets captured, clark saves him, and the facility is blown to kingdom com. all is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and suspense. oh, and cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character :).the music is probably what makes this episode work so well. if you remember correctly, the first episode steven deknight directed was agless from season 4. this was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact clark sais at the end "we didn't find you, you found us", kind of made people lose faith in the formula. but thankfully steve deknight redeemed himself in this justice episode.i had a few quivvles about justice that made it fall short of the full 10. first of all, the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the ridge facility expolsion. i mean it would have been soo much cooler if say green arrow and cyborg took off on oliver's bike (rememeber from the arrow episode). clark and impulse should have obviously ran, and aquaman should have swam via another route. but that was soo incredibly cheesy, it nocked off 2 points from the full 10.secondly, another cheesy moment, not as bad as the first, but when green arrow sais "let's go save the world". that made me cringe. all in all, judging by the acting performances, music, direction and production values, the pros do outweigh the cons, and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history, and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6.7 out of 10...

this is a reunion, a team, and a great episode of justice. from hesitation to resolution, clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a superman who, like green arrow, sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; this is also about deciding what's more important in life, a lesson for clark. i do not want the series to end, but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any "rewind" pushes and put a good end here of smallville---and a wonderful beginning of superman.in this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team. nine stars should give it enough credit.

i really enjoyed this episode. seeing the flash, cyborg, green arrow, and aquaman (even though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. to see most of the founders of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for. this sounds a bit off topic, but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. this is the thrill i got from watching this episode. i wish they had made this episode a little longer, like a two hour special, because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough. now before i bore you (unless i already have with my rambling) i just want to say, smallville is cool again. it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on lana. but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole. :( so enjoy this episode. who knows when another good one's going to come out. catch it again this thursday, feb. 22, if you missed the first airing.

show favorites green arrow (introduced this season), aquaman (introduced in season 5), "impulse" (season 4), and cyborg (season 5) all come together, along with clark, to stop one of lex's evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode.through his sophisticated technology, green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on. green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry (aqua), bart allen (impulse) and victor stone (cyborg) to stop lex and destroy these facilities. after recruiting clark to help, the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory.this episode is incredible. full of action, humor, and fabulous dialog, it feels more like a movie. it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season.

i loved this episode. it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world. i also love this episode because kyle gallner (bart allen/impulse) and justin hartley (oliver queen/green arrow) are guest starring in it!!! i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower, that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers. also, i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33.1, i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!

chloe is mysteriously saved from dr. caselli, the corrupt doctor responsible for transferring patients with abilities from belle reve to project 33.1, and a fraction of second later clark arrives. he finds that bart allan has returned to smallville and they meet each other in kent farm. when bart is captured by lex during a break-in in a luthorcorp's facility, clark discovers that the green arrow had also hired bart (a.k.a. impulse), arthur curry (aquaman) and victor stone (cyborg) to investigate the project 33.1. clark accepts to join the trio to save bart and invites chloe to participate of their mission."justice" is the best episode so far of this 6th season. in this episode, the justice league begins its saga with the association of five heroes: clark, green arrow, the flash ("impulse"), aquaman and cyborg. the participation of chloe is spectacular, completing the necessary organization to the teamwork. in the end, oliver breaks up with lois based on the importance of fighting against criminals and lex's secret laboratories around the world. my vote is ten.title (brazil): "justiça" ("justice")

first saw this movie in about 1990, and absolutely died laughing through it. it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ("i'm going home in a bag!"). needless to say, the humor is still there, 15 years later. it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film (good thing you can still buy it off ebay!) i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek..and this movie provides it all- pathos, suspense, unrequited love,nobility and the list goes on. royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller. i remember seeing him in "the 7 faces of dr. lao" as a bad guy who met a bad end. here, you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning. if you aren't careful, you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments, little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies, and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e. coyote!don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking, and shouldn't be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they won't know they're being mocked..).-now if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go get a 'zag-nut' bar....-ramsay "rc" cowlishaw, karaoke dj/entertainer

after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax. like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday. 'captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick. he was a brave man.' the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket. and always remember to beware of the 'doughnut of death!' keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and 'prepare to die earth scum!' you just have to see it for yourself.

there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off. the lead martian's jack nicholson take-off is side-splitting. the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed. this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all. make some popcorn and have a great evening.

this movie is just plain silly. almost every scene has some bit of humor: running gags, slapstick, and great jokes. the acting isn't that great, and the plot is cliche, but the jokes more than make up for that. if you have a chance to see this movie, i recommend that you do.

this movie is to halloween what the hilarious "christmas story" is to christmas: both are relatively low-budget, no-big-name-stars type films...and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available, both seasonal classics!!! "spaced invaders" comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters...all five goofy martians, klembecker the realtor, russell the deputy, vern at the "fuel dispensing depot" and so many more! you just have to see this movie to believe it, and, like "christmas story", it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing, and you pick up on fun little things each time!! most definitely a ten!!!

i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites...old person 1: you know, i remember the first time they played that thing. old person 2: you remember pterodactyls. old person 1: and i can remember you fell for that, hook line and sinker. old person 2: oh, i did not. old lady: you did so. you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians. old person 2: ain't you dead yet?

this movie is funny and suitable for any age. it is definitely family-type entertainment. the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of big bean, illinois. where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the interstate. the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians. but these martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the martians, too! the martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. j. j. anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines. watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; thought-provoking it isn't. but subtle and enjoyable it is.

like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. for example of the adult level humor, the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. the martian pilot, blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson; the scientist, that of peter seller's dr. strangelove. the special effects are surprisingly good for this film. the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is wayne alexander's "vern" character). i had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie.

anyone who does not find this movie funny, does not understand simple comedy. this movie is not a complex comedy, it is full of one liners, and sight gags, and will make anyone who wants to laugh, laugh... the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up!

if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot, it would have been just one more waste of time, money, and creative effort. fortunately, by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds, they have created a comedic marvel. who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson, complete with the lakers t-shirt. do not dismiss this film as trash.

normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles. but here is a sci-fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast.... and it is gold! the very concept of a small bunch of diminutive,aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent. don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is unsophisticated - it isn't, there's a lot of hidden treasure... a gem!

this is cult stuff. my friends and i get together once a year to enjoy this movie. its very funny and very dry . i've seen this move dozens of times and have yet not to enjoy it.the actors are funny and it gets better with every viewing! if you enjoyed "morons from out of space" you will love this. a great play on war of the worlds. i love the red-neck rampage to get the aliens, the bug on the hood, the dod, the heat seeking populous annihilator, the mine field, the red camo, breaking the speed limit by 1800mph! "i'll get the bucket!" very funny. i would love for this to come out on dvd! forget the negative reviews see it for yourself!

basically, this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do, rather than having to sit through it for two hours. or, as in my case, you see it as a kult hit, one of those movies wherein the humour, the plot, the acting, is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it, trusting the director well, the reward is: u laugh your a.. of !! the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above, actually makes the movie even more funny, because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is, which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : spaced invaders !!

laughs, adventure, a good time, a killer soundtrack, oscar-worthy acting, and special effects/ animitronics like none other, what else could you want in a movie? if you see this will be on the telly, watch it, otherwise, run out now to rent it!!!

this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises, but who love the history and traditions of sci-fi and classic hollywood movies. each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci-fi character or member of hollywood royalty and it's pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean.

i loved this movie. you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians. sure the story may have been thin at times, but you can't take away from the way it was done. i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8. its a kids movie, and besides, it has some of the greatest quotes ever. blanzee's "home on the range" rendition is awesome. very well done if you ask me, 8 of 10.

this is a thinking man's silly movie. if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i - from casting the "voice" of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either way.it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie.

if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating. but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone,just people with a sense of humor.for those people the movie is great! it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone, most of witch where b-rated themselves. along the lines of spaceballs and airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes, but it is well worth it.

being from a small town in illinois myself, i can instantly relate to this movie. considering the era it was made in, the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people i grew up with. yes the plot is so-so. and yes, the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon. but that isn't the point. the point is to suspend reality and just have fun. and this movie has fun aplenty. from the greedy,uncaring banker to the well meaning,but dimwitted deputy, this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at it's best. who can't smile at the sight of the enforcer drone or the vern droid? and i loved the farmzoid. wish i had one when i was growing up. overall, considering the technology they had available at the time, this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood, when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon, popcorn in hand, and laugh at the foibles of small town living. this is a movie i would watch again and again, if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways.

"i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!" the small town sheriff laments."this happens a lot in chicago?" his deputy asks.well, no, not really. the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion, and conclude they need to get in on the action! what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of "big bean, il". everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes, except for the sheriff's daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit.the martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. it's a fun family movie.

"spaced invaders" is one of the funniest movies, i´ve ever seen. i don´t understand, why this movie didn´t get better critics, it´s funny, harmless and sweet. i first watched it, when i was 11, and i really fell in love with it... 2 days later, i got it on vhs :-p till today, i´ve shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. i think, that´s the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... this movie never got a real chance, that´s sad, "si" has really the potential of a comedy like "monsters inc." or "spaceballs". ok, enough displeasure - what i really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! even if you don´t get mad about it, it´s worth watching! --> prepare to laugh, earth scum!

i don't know how anyone could hate this movie. it is so funny. it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline. it's not your typical alien movie. these aliens are so stupid and confused. you need to rent it at least once.

this movie is not for everyone. you're either bright enough to get "it" or you're not. fans of sci-fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie. i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it. if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films, you'll probably enjoy this one. the voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious.

looking at some of the negative posts, you really have to wonder what some people do for fun....i was lucky enough to see the film during its all-too-brief theatrical run. the audience laughed its heads off. i'm watching a tape of it as i type and it's still dang funny!it's also got a sweet side, with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. the late, great royal dano is especially effective as the lonely, down-on-his-luck farmer wrenchmuller. ariana richards and j.j. anderson are great as the lead kids. and the actors in the martian suits, although limited to mime, do a great jobanother thing to look for is the background details. the film is full of homages, pastiches, and references to other sf and fantasy films. take a look at the martian costumes next time. one of them is wearing a marty mcfly costume, another is a ghostbuster, a third is in a house atreides uniform, and a fourth is wearing a last starfighter flightsuit.

after mistaking a halloween re-broadcast of orson welles' classic radio adaptation of war of the worlds for a real martian invasion, a group of moronic martians shows up on earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.this really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. it will most likely appeal to sci-fi fans. this has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than i expected it to be. despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest martian invasion ever put to film. interestingly enough, the martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic action hero/sci-fi hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). fun for the whole family. "prepare to die! earth scum!"

years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie theaters's in between the actual features along with a newsreel of current events, plus cartoons, especially on a saturday afternoon. (the parents loved it mostly) "the return of chandu" was a 12 episode serial where chandu,(bela lugosi),"the mysterious mr. wong",'34 is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of egypt,(nadji)maria alba,"dr. terror's house of horrors",'43. princess nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of ubasti, who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long-dead goddess ossana. these 12-episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced, considering we are talking about 1934 !

how truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi. it is disarmingly friendly and lively. it's the document of a longlost craft. (the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) chandu is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic . it refreshes the mind. it's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. chandu has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun.without giving away too muchchandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.as to the quite sexy niece, nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti: the sordid vindhyan. the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals. would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does?lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosiyet burton's biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. i enjoy lugosi' fancy performances.this serial is unjustly bashed.

bela lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit (which was also the source of a feature film where lugosi played the villain.) lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way. here chandu returns from the east in order to help the princess nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult. this is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun. to be certain the pacing is a bit slack, more akin to one of principals (the producing studios) features then a rip roaring adventure, but it's still enjoyable. this plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that "hey i missed something". one of the trilogy of three good serials lugosi made, the others being sos coast guard and phantom creeps

in 1967 i visited the lake elsinore glider-port and flew a yellow pratt read sailplane. returning to germany the above serious ran on tv and one segment was about the high altitude sailplane flights in california in the early 50ies. (the real life pilot was bill ivans, i don't know who played him in the series) it turned out that the sailplane in the film was the same (same n-number) as the one i had flown at lake elsinore. ever since i saw that segment i have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available. (other segments in that serious were about the baker ejection seat; an instrument to find avalanche victims etc.

with the death of george nader, on 4 february 2002, i thought of this most interesting program, which even though it had only a short run, was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout. generally unseen for over 40+ years it would be worth viewing again. the opening credits showed many differing images, one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp, riding his famed rocket sled, at the point where he was often referred to as "the fastest man alive".

or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like amer. life tv network. i have been watching another favorite, "voyage to the bottom of the sea", as well as "lost in space" and land of giants". they've been showing them forever but aren't receptive to suggestions for other shows. my father and i were big fans as i was already a big science/electronics nut, (still am) and my father was an old school chum of nader. they both attended oxy together. i still have memories of several of the episodes even though i was only 9. more so than any show that old. i think it was televised on sat. after "bonanza". some of the episodes i recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action. or the one where he body surfs the big ones, (i did that too!) or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trance-like state. that is the one show that i wish i could see again. i got my wish with the original "outer limits" and "sci-fi theater...john

this final voyager episode begins 23 years in the future. voyager has made it back home. in the many years it took to return tho, the vulcan tuvoks' mind has been destroyed. he carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure.captain janeway comes across aliens who have time travel technology. she realizes, there's a warp conduit in the delta quadrant that could bring voyager home immediately - if she could go back in time and notify voyager. there's one problem. the conduit is deep inside borg space.janeway visits tuvok. he's like a child. he scribbles tho, obsessed, working on math problems or movie reviews or something, he's convinced are important somehow. in the institution, tuvok cries, asking for 'janeway' to please, please come back to him.janeway decides to commandeer a federation shuttle and equip it with weapons technology 20 years ahead of the borg, in the hopes of going back in time and using this new technology to guide voyager to the warp conduit.when she goes back in time and links up with voyager, janeway meets her younger self. the two captains disagree, arguing about the plan. the real-captain visits tuvok asking him if it's true he has a brain disorder. tuvok admits it's true, but it can't be cured by the facilities on the ship so he's kept it to himself.the young captain agrees to the older captains' plan. to increase their chances of success the older janeway plans to distract the borg with her shuttle craft. the borg actually capture janeway and her shuttle. the borg queen personally assimilates captain janeway. but janeway's expected this! the borg queen has assimilated a virus into herself that kills her. with the borg queen dead voyager makes it thru the warp conduit back to federation space.

i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2-3 years. thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes. for those that don't really watch every single episode and know them by heart, through tng, ds9, voyager, etc., general popular consensus will say -- "i like the next generation" the best. that's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation. but to be quiet honest, i appreciate the creativity of voyager's episodes more than tng. voyager's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng. granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager's doctor -- now that's creativity! instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined. not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best! endgame portray him as a husband married to an "organic", inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even -- in the episode before endgame, to disobey captain's order and make "human" mistakes. unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode, voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality. of course the rest of the voyager's cast chemistry just flows effortless, harry kim and tom paris -- very natural. i love tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a vulcan. finally, i'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh, if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank god for kate! she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. what a great job! thank you star trek for making voyager, i enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, of morals, and of our cosmic expanse.

spoilers. like other posters, i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt. i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return. i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by "front loading" some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode. (of course, that time line has been eradicated, so it's all moot.) i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew. as fans, we get to have our cake and eat it to, by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on. i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp. fortunately, mulgrew(s) pulled it off.

this is a great ending to the show. the fact that adm. janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great. the fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the queen with a "poison" that in, essence, ended the borg was great. the way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie. however, they did bring them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic!! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family. ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad. was a great way to show a new beginning. it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today.

the past few months i have collected voyager seasons 4 to 7 on dvd (i only had 1 to 3 on video before that, because kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it. am i satisfied with the ending? i think i am. naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. in many ways "endgame" is similar to next gen's "all good things" the involvement of the crew in the future, but mainly the captain. a new romance starting in the finale (troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here), which results in death in the future. i truly loved "endgame," fair to all characters, neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. b'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom. tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. the doctor, in the future, is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe! but of course the captain has the largest role, meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. the borg are involved, as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager. alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically, just her voice and acting method are magnificent. i feel sorry for susanna thompson though, the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen. maybe she wasn't available though. the special effects are fantastic, the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart! it's very tense. especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection, on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse. voyager could have continued. if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home, like in harry's speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there. and then they could have got home in a film!overall, voyager was a bit hit and miss. the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible! my perception of seven of nine was that she took over, it all revolved around her, which wasn't true. when she first appeared, season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. and her character is ingenious at times, 20 years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. i like her, especially in "someone to watch over me," "imperfection," and "human error." when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely. chakotay became my least favourite character. gone was the chemistry with janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer, he's completely pushed aside most of the time. i loved seeing tom and b'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. i always liked neelix a lot. tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with neelix. harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. the doctor is probably my favourite, seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates ("tinker, tenor, doctor, spy" is fantastic!). janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it. i wish there was more, i love voyager!

burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie, along with dennehy. although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. the beauty of nature captures this movie, placing among one of the best i have ever seen. the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic!! any horse-lovers out there will love this movie!

as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie. there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does. i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film. would also like to know if he enjoys horses. brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden. where did he learn to ride? the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt, like a horse can run forever at full steam. the camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse. it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders.

the man from snowy river ii doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd-pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes.for those fans wanting the elements that made the original man from snowy river film a hit, (breathtaking scenery, sweeping score, sweet romanticism and cracking action) this film really delivers. this story picks up a few years from the end of the first, jim (tom burlinson) has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses. he returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well-bred sweetheart jessica (played by aussie divine lady sigrid thornton) who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station (harrison is now played by american brian dennehy). the foil to jim and character that shakes the plot is the well-to-do upper class snob alistair patton (nicholas eadie) who has his sights on jessica. add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot.the best thing about this film is the acting. tom burlinson fits snugly into jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour. sigrid thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen. filling the solid shoes of kirk douglas was never going to be easy and brian dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part.the music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a victoria tourism reel. there are moment however that feel very self-indulgent, like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama. a little more grit would have sufficed here, we are aussie's, we can take it!! there are some very jawsish moments with the stallion that defy belief. however the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichés, there are some really inventive and touching scenes. jim putting the saddle on the stallion (very horse whisperish before its time) jim and jessica setting up home, the fabulous scene where jim shows up alistair's riding with his trusty whip. i can see why this character is such an icon.altogether a very pleasing sequel. here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another. the man from snowy river iii: the craigs. i'm sure we'd all love to see how jim and jessica are doing on their farm.the aussie dvd has a couple of extra scenes in it. worthwhile if you are already a fan.

such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was, the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow-up should be. it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor, preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality.the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence. the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century, of australian history, legend and horses. the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism. the plot is far more vibrant than the first film, and much more showy, with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film, yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film; sensationally beautiful cinematography, a stunning focus of the australian high country, the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way. geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry. the lead cast, from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton, and a well-replaced brian dennehy, carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film. as far as sequels can go, the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again.

forget neo and bourne and all those half-baked made up modern heroes. they only look 12 year-oldish to please the wide audience of geeks that want to be their heroes. since they cannot be rambo or mcclane or even indiana jones, hollywood allowed a bunch of fakes that have no beard and yet fulfill teenagers wishes to see something that looks very much like an action flick.however, their " action set-pieces " are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question. this explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. for better ( rocky, rambo ) or worse ( die hard 4 - where john mcclane, brace yourselves.... had no beard !! )i say it is high-time a new hero walked up and put their reign to an end. this " largo winch " movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable at times, but at least tomer sisley delivered a very promising performance as an action-hero. and the only one time where he was weakened is when mélanie thierry shaved his beard ! i rest my case.i didn't know it when i entered the theater room, but this might be the movie i've been waiting for a decade. for the first time in france since belmondo, can a movie be both well- crafted and rooted in b-genre without blushing over its performance. in the meantime all we had to chew on was either a gigantic pile of dung or something too restricted to reach a wider audience... in other words it was " le pacte des loups " or " dobermann " ( i like dobermann, mind you )... i believe " largo winch " has what it takes to be both popular and quality film-making.i exited the theater room very pleased, and hungry for more.

when i sat down to watch 'largo winch' i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars. when i stood up, i've seen both of these; and more.karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie, to start with. kristin scott thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic, both acting superbly. in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well.the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but i understand why people would get bored with it.the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me, and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island.rolls royce phantom; mercedes s500, and bmw 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. it is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.my vote, as it has enlightened a gloomy day is: 10/10

i'm not aware of "largo winch" as a comic book (or is it graphic novel? i actually don't know), but i have to admit, hearing about an agent/hero movie, i did expect quite something different, than what i actually got.while it was startling to watch this at first, it was nice watching this move along. you could never really tell where it would go (some twists are foreseeable, but in general, you can never really say, were it will end up going). a more than stellar performance from the lead actor and a really good support cast, make this an enjoyable watch. not as action packed as some might hope or expect for a movie like that, but a really good mixture.

who doesn't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio (the three countries where the french "bd" or "bandes dessinées" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show, the real thing begins.first of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. as a 1st class-fan of the comic book, i must confess i was nicely surprised. the actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast. i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet.

i've been looking for the name of this film for years. i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983. all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl, alone, having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon. i remember people were looking for her(family) and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin. i don't remember much else about this movie, and want to see it again--if this is the same one--and if any of you have a copy, could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? i'd be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember. it was aired on thanksgiving(us) in 1983, and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me. thanks in advance!

i have seen "miracles still happen" now at least four times. i never tire of this fantastic movie. from the very beginning, it holds a person's interest. as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon, following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor. losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon. to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals, snakes and other reptiles, the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects. as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town. remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community, this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie. at times having to swim in dangerous waters, alone, frightened, injured, she always managed to keep going. towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils. eventually as she sees a canoe, she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her, after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers. such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon! movies like this aren't made much those days. i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it! to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable! also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable, whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon. a brilliant movie, superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching! strongly recommended by me for sure!

i saw this when i was 17 and haven't seen it since. the 'cbs late movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point. i remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach. effects then weren't what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon, after losing both parents and searching for a way out, very well. i remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh. it's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for tv. i wish i remembered more details, and if i ever get the chance to see it again, i can comment more. i have been looking for this for years. i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title. i have no idea whether it was ever released on video.

i first saw this movie back in the 1980's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen! i would recommend anyone to look at this movie. you will not be sorry. it is well acted out, so real and never a dull moment. the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there. from the beginning right up to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention. the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone. it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions. this is why this movie is so appealing. the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming. i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of. this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies! i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen!

while the 'special effects' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some, i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age. the story of this girl's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years, and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen.the fact that this is a true story, and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie. each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television, drinking in each scene with an interest i cannot explain. i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult (and with a jaded view of the world) it may not be as enjoyable to some. i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son.this, like many other movies, is not for everyone. if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories, are partial to peru/macchu picchu and/or the amazon, then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years.

i liked this movie very much because it is a true story set in the amazon, a part of the world that always has intrigued me. i believe a condensed form of the book was published in "reader's digest" soon after the actual event occurred.because i am a "baby boomer," the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason i related to the film. i also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character's following the streams that lead to the river and to the coastal settlements where she can get help, as well as other survival techniques. most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude. in conclusion, i hope viewers learn something from it, in addition seeing it for entertainment.i do wish the movie would be released in vhs and dvd soon as i should like to add it to my video collection. it also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels.

the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv (ch. 5) during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s, mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve. it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through, being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle. the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer. not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time. definitely not a rankin-bass production.

it was considered to be the "swiss answer to the lord of the rings", but it is much more than that. it isn't an answer to anything, it's in itself something new, something funny and sometimes it's downright stupid and silly - but was monty python any different than silly?the beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously. cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated. but, to compensate the missing special effects, the landscape does the trick. it is absolutely beautiful and stunning - who needs new zealand, switzerland has it all. what i liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it. it isn't brilliant; yet it's got some good humorous parts. edward piccin as friedo is absolutely convincing, it would be enough to go and see the film because of him!there are some good jokes, some of them are very lame, some of them won't be understood by people outside of switzerland. i liked the idea of having "urucows" instead of uruk hai; i loved the scene where friedo decides to take "pupsi", a telehobbie, with him on the journey. also very funny is the scene when rackaroll, the sword-fighting knight, decides to show off with his sword - and subsequently smashes it into a wall, breaking it. and there is this one scene where the "nazgul-ish" characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush... i didn't approve of the idea of the ring being used by schleimli, the "gollum" character, in order to "seduce" the ladies. that was a bit far fetched. the idea of lord sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either. original, certainly, but not brilliant. but most of all did i dislike the idea of a gay dragon, that really wasn't necessary. all in all i recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy. don't expect a lotr parody like "spaceballs" was for star wars. but if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out, with absolutely no ambitions, then you'll enjoy. i am not sure if it works in other languages, because it does live from the swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors.all in all: hat off to the courage of the swiss crew who did that!

as this movie is completely in swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie. i'm not from switzerland, but i worked there for some years, so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings. i've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg. scary movie, loads of scifi spoofs etc.) but this one is the best one of that kind, i've seen so far. i give a 9 of 10. the only reason i can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd, so there's almost no chance for non-swiss to understand.

i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings. well, so i was. and so i really love this movie. especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless know-it-all wizard): almghandi, the cowardice and brain dead transvestite. sauron's counterpart ("sauraus" from east germany, of course) is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet. aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword ("ulrike" the legend) with scotch tape. and "strunzdumm" (the counterpart of wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif! and don't forget grmpfli and heidi... huh-huh

i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith. i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church. it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.as a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had "knowingly deceived" church members into believing he had been called to be joseph's successor as the prophet. although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church. brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that god truly speaks to prophets today, and that brigham young, like joseph smith, was an inspired prophet of god.whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed.

this is a wonderful movie about the struggle of the mormons and their final settlement in salt lake, utah. the beginning and the ending are especially powerful, and the message is one we all have to be reminded of - god doesn't talk, but he communicates, if we would only listen. as i am writing this in the midst of the horrors going on in new orleans and the surrounding area due to katrina, i was especially moved by the mormons having to leave everything behind and move on after joseph smith was assassinated. people came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. the struggle of the mormons to cross the country, the cost in lives, the hardship they suffered was truly awe-inspiring, demonstrating their tremendous strength. as far as the actual beliefs of mormons, this is not heavily gone into, and polygamy is mentioned but is not a centerpiece of the film at all.the cast is top-notch, though others who have commented know more about the actual characters and can talk about how true the portrayals were. but as actors, dean jagger, mary astor, brian donlevy, john carradine, jane darwell all do excellently with the script they were given.though the film could have easily stood on its own (and certainly does today) tyrone power and linda darnell were added to the cast to get the crowds into the movie theaters to see a film about the mormons. power is magnificently handsome as a young mormon, and darnell, as zina, is not a mormon but stays on with the family after her father is killed. power does not have much to do until the end of the film, when he has a big scene, and darnell (still a teenager at the time of the filming) has even less, though they make a lovely couple. their fate is left unclear regarding her conversion, and one does wonder about the polygamy in their case. you can't beat either one for eye candy, however.

i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the movie;however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from byu's curator, motion picture archives james d'arc. the then lds prophet heber j. grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events. for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial. despite brigham young's great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway. then joseph was killed. historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything. brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial. joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place.

henry hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love of the people of the early days in us history. however, to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film. in my opinion, hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release. in often subtle filming and dialog delivery, he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.i remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's. that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed, which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were. i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his film.1. love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs, 2. charity to those in need or not, 3. family is high in importance, 4. listen respectfully and carefully, because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt, 5. work hard, both individually and in community, 6. prepare and store for future days of need, 7. hope is a binding link to a higher being, and for our daily lives, 8. and, that there is a unique quality to any group, and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial.

i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized.i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.

fox's epic telling of one a america's greatest pioneering efforts comes to dvd with some truly outstanding "extras". brigham young (the "frontiersman" was added for the european release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the mormon faith (church of jesus christ of latter-day saints)out to the salt lake valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, joseph smith (played by vincent price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as america was about to enter world war ii. it was a daring move on fox chief, darryl f. zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. now fox, working with james d'arc, curator of the excellent motion picture archives at brigham young university in provo, utah, has brought this film to the dvd format in an outstading edition. mr. d'arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a dvd. he seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by church leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. one of the fun bits of information deals with dean jagger, the actor who plays the title role. many years after the film he married a latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the lds faith. there is much to be learned from d'arc's knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the dvd! there are over 100 pictures from the fox & byu archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in salt lake city. thanks fox for another outstanding dvd -- and thank you, james d'arc for your great commentary!

for a long time, 'the menagerie' was my favorite 'star trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'city on the edge of forever.' what i used to prefer about 'menagerie' was that it's more hard-core star trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current trek storyline. i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of spock being court-martialed is a clever one. you can poke holes in the plot if you want. for instance, given the talosians' mind-control abilities and captain pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet? and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st's only two-parter.

imagine that you could have anything you wanted, go anywhere you wished, be anything you'd ever dreamed of being - through thought alone. now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life. what would you do? would such powers be worth your soul? this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher pike in "the cage" the now-legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series. famously deemed "too cerebral" and "too cold" by nbc brass and rejected, "the cage" was nevertheless the most ambitious and costly pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time, and gene roddenberry did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste, with the result being this truly classic star trek episode, which embeds "the cage" into a frame story which deepens and extends the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale, a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci-fi stories ever filmed for the small screen...star date 3012: the uss enterprise diverts to starbase 11 after mr. spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise. surprisingly, the message cannot be from captain pike after all, as he is now confined to a wheelchair, mute and horribly disfigured after a tragic accident. kirk and starbase commanding officer commodore mendez attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery, but before the matter can be cleared up, spock - for reasons as yet unknown - commits an act of open mutiny, kidnapping the helpless captain pike and hijacking the enterprise via a brilliantly thought-out and timed plan aided by a few vulcan nerve pinches. soon, the enterprise is headed for the remote, forbidden planet of talos iv. mendez informs kirk that talos iv is under interdiction, and any contact with the planet by starfleet vessels or personnel carries an immediate death sentence, meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself, and kirk as well, given that the captain will be held responsible for the ship's activities. appalled, kirk and mendez give chase in a shuttlecraft, which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and oxygen are nearly gone. spock - knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship - is of course unable to consign the captain to certain death. after ordering the craft to be retrieved and the occupants beamed aboard, spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested, after having set the starship on an irreversible course to talos iv. upon reassuming command, kirk demands an explanation, whereupon spock requests immediate court martial by a tribunal of starfleet commanding officers - of whom there are three on board - mendez, kirk, and the crippled invalid captain pike. spock's encyclopedic knowledge of starfleet regulations enables him to manipulate the tribunal into allowing him to present otherwise inadmissible evidence. spock presents video recordings of the only contact ever made between the federation and the inhabitants of talos iv - a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under pike's command. kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail, but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by pike himself, who turns out to have been lured to talos iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a federation research vessel which crashed there 18 years previously. among the survivors is vina, a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster. pike is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot, whereupon he is waylaid and captured by the talosians, a race of androgynous humanoids with enormous cranial capacity and the power to transform thoughts into virtual reality. after pike's capture, the rest of the "survivors" vanish as none of them really existed except vina. the episode ends when the tribunal learns that spock's "evidence" is in fact being transmitted to the enterprise directly from talos iv, in violation of starfleet regulations. starfleet orders an immediate halt to the transmissions, and we wonder what will happen next...to be continued in a review of "the menagerie: part ii"!

it is a well known fact that when gene roddenberry first pitched star trek to nbc, the original pilot episode, the cage, was rejected for being "too cerebral". when the series was given another chance, roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing the menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequel to what was still, at the time, an unaired episode.this time, rather than exploring a new planet, kirk and his crew are on starbase 11, paying a visit to the former commander of the enterprise, christopher pike (sean kenney), now horribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. pike joins his successor on the starship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: spock, who used to serve under pike, has effectively hijacked the vessel and set the course for talos iv, a planet which is off-limits (the punishment is death) since pike and spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. naturally, being a logical creature, spock turns himself in and arranges a court-martial so that he can justify his actions.there's no need to say more about the plot, since the rest will play out in part 2. what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe, by coming up with a particular type of flashback (to say more would be too much) that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what could have been of trek, had nbc not turned down the original project. in particular, it's fun to see jeffrey hunter (who was unable to return in the menagerie) play pike as a more serious captain than kirk usually is and nimoy's early days as spock, whose personality hadn't been fully established yet: this is the only time in the entire series that everybody's favorite vulcan spontaneously grins.in short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treat for those who can't be bothered to track down the cage in its original form (it's available as part of the season 3 box set).

in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes, the tag line was "is it real or is it memorex?" the same might be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "the cage," the first pilot of star trek. mr. spock has cleverly commandeered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet talos iv in order to allow capt. christopher pike, his first captain who has been burned and paralyzed, to return there. why the finagling? because to have any contact at all with talos iv invites a death sentence. why this is so is never explained - that bothered me tremendously - but, if nothing else, it adds to the story. after he has gotten the ship to travel to talos iv, mr. spock turns himself in to dr. mccoy (the senior-most officer present; capt. kirk was off the ship) for arrest and says, "the charge is mutiny, dr.; i never received orders to take over the ship." what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important (besides the obvious paralysis) for capt. pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock's death. the illusions the talosians create, the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic. and meg wyllie as the keeper (the head talosian) is wonderful. call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect! the talosians, having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion, are also unisex; you can't really tell if they're male or female and it really doesn't matter. this episode, more than almost any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced! what a neat thing if this were so! this is one of my favorite episodes and, no matter how many times i've seen it (i even have it on video), it never fails to fascinate me. meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly.

the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot "the cage." the move was made out of necessity, to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced (such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time). one positive outcome back then was that audiences, unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier, were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters, as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history (though they still used terms such as 'united space fleet' in these early episodes).the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot: the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans. astonishingly, though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock's vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible, it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain, pike, now horribly crippled. well, spock is half human, we tend to forget. or has he simply gone mad? it may very well be, for he's directing enterprise to talos iv, a planet so off-limits it's the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet's books. when the jig is up, there's a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy, as uhura looks on in shock. even kirk, usually steady as a captain should be, doesn't know what to make of his first officer's illogical conduct.in the 3rd and final acts, we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior, when capt. pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers. we really don't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish - and that's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it's all about in the 2nd part. not only is spock facing severe penalties, but it looks like kirk's career may be finished, as well. double jeopardy, folks. this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts (none were available in the earlier "the enemy within" when the crafts were really needed). there's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then. finally, check out kirk's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy, do things go sideways on him as the story progresses.

i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story.but since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character.i don't know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion.this is a solid western-type movie for everybody's tastes. heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. otherwise, i don't think i could recommend it.

fantastic movie. one to excite all 5 senses. is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. true hollywood conventions used, like playing a list and very attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as naomi watts (julia cook - ned kelly's lover), heath ledger (ned) and orlando bloom (joe byrne - ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry geoffrey rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt victorian police force. this also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between ned (ledger) and julia cook (watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. even from the first scene, when ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him "sunshine" and had a "glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder," it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with ned kelly, the underdog. besides, don't all aussies love an underdog?

i'm tired of people judging films on their "historical accuracy". it's a movie people!! the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history....braveheart, wyatt earp, gangs of new york, geronimo: an american legend, the last of the mohicans....all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically. if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best, then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts. just enjoy the quality of the film, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.

i thought that this film was very well made, heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless. orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable. how true it is to what really happened i have no idea, but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do. maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film. all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas.

definitely one of my favourite movies. the story is good, acting is great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever.heath ledger is terrific as edward ''ned'' kelly. he is gripping as the legendary outlaw, and is supported well by geoffrey rush, naomi watts and orlando bloom. all action sequences are on pointthe film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end. one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in. and makes no mistake here.an excellent film all round.

i didn't know what to expect from 'ned kelly', but absolutely loved it. it was dark, dramatic and gripping. it also felt very authentic, i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800's. i've never been much of a heath ledger fan, having only seen him in teen type movies, however he is quite compelling in this role. ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia's most notorious killer. naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover. highly recommended - and that's from an aussie!

the only reason i wanted to see this was because of orlando bloom. simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. it's not bad, but it's really not very good. the editing is good; the film is well-paced. the direction is competent and assured. the story is plodding. the film is averagely acted by ledger, bloom, and the normally great watts and rush. the accents are impenetrable if you're from the us so just sit back and enjoy the scenery (or as i like to call it, orlando bloom). by the end of the film, i was neither bored nor moved. some people have asked what happened to ned kelly at the end of the movie. i have to say, i so did not care by that point.really, the only reason i can recommend this is that orlando bloom kind of, sort of shows some hints of range (although the oft-present "i'm pretty and confused" look is prominent), so fangirls may find it worth the matinee price. other than that, just don't see it. it's neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining.

how could i possibly pass up the chance to see orlando bloom and heath ledger together? well, i couldn't and so, i rented this mess of a movie.i had never heard of ned kelly and was surprised by what i found out about this young man's legend. i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was. perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or maybe it was because it really is a little slow, i found this story difficult to follow. not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. even with a slow story, ledger and bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. though i flounder to recommend this as a must see, it is a great story of australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film does have some good actions sequences. 6/10 see it for historical value....(yeah right...and that's the only reason to see it... ;) )

i loves this movie,because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved! heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe. it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that. the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there. this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers! i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at! also that that is how people remember them,from their armor. i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have.

'ned kelly' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero. we are taken into the world of ned, his best friend, joe byrne, and the other members of the kelly gang, as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned's actions.there is an exceptional cast present, who all give stellar performances, which brings the film to life. (great job, heath!) orlando bloom was fantastic as joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladiesman very well. i was swept up in the moment. for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan, alas, it was not to be.some aspects of the film are fictional, and as an avid ned kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed by this. perhaps also the film could've gone longer, to cover more of the kelly gang's/ned's life - i felt not enough was covered.regardless of a few flaws, this is a moving film, which stirs all sorts of emotions. (and hey, i'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned...)

i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. when i saw the trailer for the first time, i could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. not to mention orlando bloom ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. i think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.

those who know who know the kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. naomi watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best ned (not hard considering the previous ned's include yahoo serious, mick jagger & former carlton champion (australian rules football) bob chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. some location shooting film in the area i live, bacchus marsh outside melbourne as well as clunes & ballarat.

'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli'. such was ned's bravery.in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised. in greta he is still a hero, the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in mansfield they still haven't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered' were from there.many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged, to the post office he held up in jerilderie. a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones' hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited.evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria, in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning. none of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify neds actions. the horse that ned 'stole' was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail). ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it.the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before. it is not self justification it is ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting. so go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for.

the performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a victorian living historian, i was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.i wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.ok, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film. gregor jordan said in the extra feature on the dvd that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.see it and you will not be sorry

the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. during several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.which is where this adaptation of our sunshine, a novel about the kelly legend, excels. rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. here, ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. no, i am not making that up. about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles. while the kelly gang were distinctly irish, australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this).heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw. it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself. orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. but it is naomi watts, appearing as julia cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. ditto for watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. i can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. but that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. if one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at glenrowan. annoyingly, the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.that said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. for that reason, i rated it a seven out of ten. other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere. especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life.

i'm sure that not many people outside of australia have ever heard of the legend of ned kelly. i once saw a documentary about the man, but that's the only time i once saw or heard anything about him. and i guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. no-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.the movie tells the story of ned kelly's life. the irish immigrant has lived in north-west victoria all his life, but has never been very welcome by the authorities. the police always accuses him of everything they can think of and they keep harassing his family. when kelly is fed up with the way everything goes, he forms a gang with his brother and two other men. they start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days. all this violence leads to a man hunt organized by the police and when they kill three policemen, they are outlawed. finally they take over a pub in glenrowan, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train full of police to derail at a part of the track that they tore up. but the train is able to stop in time because someone warns them and what will follow is a battle on life and death between the police and the four gunmen...it's very hard to tell whether all of what is shown in the movie is true or false. i guess nobody really knows, because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth: one camp says he was a hero, some kind of robin hood, the others will say he was an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief. i really couldn't tell you which of them is right, perhaps both are, but what i can tell you is that the facts in the movie as well as is the documentary were about the same.this movie was a nice addition to the documentary i once saw and i really enjoyed the performances of all the actors. heath ledger, orlando bloom, naomi watts, geoffrey rush are all actors who are pretty well known, but even the lesser known actors show in this production that they all know what good acting should look like. i really enjoyed this movie and i give it a 7.5/10

there are few films that leave me with the feeling that gregor jordan's 'ned kelly' film did. initially i had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. since then, i have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, i am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. it is also wonderful to see something australian! i appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. this film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. the cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might i add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. it is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. however, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. in reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in australian history. for example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between joe byrne and aaron sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. also overlooked was the fact that it was not only aaron sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. i feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. however, i can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. it certainly inspired me to look more closely. so, watch it and decide for yourself. you might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine. maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an australian audience? for me, i'd call it a breath of fresh air!

due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was, i didn't go and see this film at the cinema. after watching it on dvd, i have to say i regret that now. i'm not saying it is brilliant, but i would venture to say that it is a good movie. i enjoyed it.people have skulls thicker than ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. if you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures, there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. i don't think ganghis kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. what kind of man ned kelly actually was is a matter of debate, and quite passionate it seems. in spite of the efforts of governments and some historians, ned kelly has become a legend. legends are stories, and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. ned kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. a society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.so not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical kelly gang, i actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. it was sentimental and romantic, but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow australians, watch 'the lighthorseman' and you will see what i mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas, such as the shooting of the troopers. ironically, i actually enjoyed the movie because of that, because it would be those details that most of the focus on ned's story would dwell. and they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.this movie was always going to have a hard time, having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to australians; perhaps a little of ned's spirit is in this movie, because i think it rebelled against people's expectations, and unfortunately missed both targets. fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. for me it was an unexpected kind of movie about ned, and that is why i liked it. orlando bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. i think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf, for a change.when you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one, your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. send me this on dvd for christmas rather than croc dundee or the man from snowy river anytime.

for a danish movie, i have to say, that this is very good movie.it's in a class of its own, yet it has an international potential.the movie has a big budget, and is starring famous danish actors, and a few newcomers, who play very well. it can be watched by anyone who like adventures, and a little bit of 'ghost' movie.don't be afraid, be thrilled!

wow! a danish movie with this kind of content? i mean, the actors, the story, the pictures, the efx - everything was where it should be. and a danish efx house producing those vfx - wow! this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality.*spoiler ahead* the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good, but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost-movie. *end of spoiler*but anyway, this is a danish movie which i as a dane can be proud of.the only "bad" about this, is that it wasn't a danish director, but a swedish...

i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister. instead, i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared. in many ways still a children´s story, but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential. could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience.

the lion king 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go along with the lion king. it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists. in the movie,e vents are explained by a different characters point of view. this story is still an original plot.as far as sequels go, disney isn't all that great at making worthwhile ones. this one, being the third part to the lion king (simba's pride is the second.) actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first. timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live. after searching far and wide, they find the place of "hakuna matata". they then meet a small lion named simba, and go through many things that parents today go through.i think this is a very good movie, and i'm happy to add it to my collection.

i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther. having a baby sister.. you know how it is. by now i memorized both the plot and the lines. after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see... the second one was significantly weaker... then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2... i was like ok there we go again. after watching the 1 1/2 i was like wow. all my expectations (for repetitevness) were broken. a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time. i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100%.i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon.

possible spoilers: not surewhile watching the lion king 1 1/2, i couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film. it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did. the story, for those who haven't read the other reviews, is about how timon and pumbaa meet, and how they affect events in the original lion king.there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie. my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba. however, for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original. i can never look at the "circle of life" or "can you feel the love tonight" sequences the same way again (i'm okay with the "i just can't wait to be king" sequence).the voice talents are excellent. nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job, as do matthew broderick, the guy who does rafiki, and the hyenas. even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me. but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu? he literally had only 2 lines, and neither were very necessary. the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent, although you still can't hear timon's mom's voice and not think of marge simpson.there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original, the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end. how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas?as for the dvd itself, you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set, the special features are especially lacking. they could have easily fit a commentary, or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc. i enjoyed the "who wants to be king of the jungle" game, even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i've ever seen. some of the questions are actually difficult.overall, a good movie, though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk2.

if the lion king was a disney version of hamlet, then the lion king 3: hakuna matata is a disney version of guildenstern and rosencrantz are dead. just like tom stoppard's beguiling film, we get to view the action from the point of view of two of the minor characters from the original: timon, the meerkat with a penchant for breaking into song at the drop of a hat, and pumbaa, the warthog with flatulence issues. by following their story - rather than simba's - we get to see why all the animals bowed down as simba was presented from pride rock. we find out what made timon and pumbaa decide to follow simba back to pride rock to oust scar. and we find out how they dealt with the hyena's once and for all. nathan lane as timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is ably supported by ernie sabella as pumbaa. it is also good to hear matthew broderick and whoopi goldberg reprising their roles. julie kavner and jerry stiller lend their distinctive voices to two new characters: timon's mother and uncle. the only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device which doesn't always help to progress the story. having said that, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. with more laughs than any other third-in-a-disney-series movie, hakuna matata is worth watching - if only for the hot tub scene which is still funny despite being a little bit predictable.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers***this movie, "the divers", is really interesting. all i roughly knew about it was that it would involve nazi history, underwater scenes and everybody would be speaking danish. but i decided to check it out for one reason, the fact that the story evolves around a sunken wwii german submarine. i've got a fetish for german subs, especially wrecks that can be dived upon. so i was a bit sceptical about the danish part, but reasoned that the sub could weigh up that part. knowing that nordic films aren't always that good and not sure of the budget size i was, to say the least, very sceptical.upon viewing i was ... surprised.i had some thoughts on the actors being inadequate, seeing how some are very young, the two main actors in particular. this was not an issue, they both perform very well. as do the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. this makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. not unique in anyway, but somewhat rare. and it's all good.as for the danish language, it is nearly impossible to understand. but this was no problem, it had subtitles.another issue was the submarine itself, i suspected there would be interior shots as well as underwater exterior shots of the submarine. having decided their budget was slim, i thought this could turn out adequate at the best and down right awful at it's worst. again i was surprised, the exterior scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the interior scenes are very realistic. having a fetish for german subs, i knew what the sub should look like, especially inside, and was not let down. the team has done some serious research. it's all good.i suspect more people than myself will watch this movie just to see some sub wreck scenes so i feel i must issue a "warning". the submarine in the movie is not an actual model that existed during the war. it's a special purpose sub. but to give you a hint of what to expect, it's a crossing between a type vii, type ix and a japanese transport sub similar to i-52. it's god a good design and makes a nice wreck.the setting is on a danish island or peninsula, i can't remember. it's summertime and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming of summer as they do every year. their grandfather is a mariner of sorts. the cinematography is quite nice, a lot of pretty summer scenes at the island docks, some newfound teenage love, nice diving weather and a general feeling of "perfect". once again, it's all good.plot-wise the island gets some visitors of the suspect kind, a gathering of men hire one of the boats, an old minesweeper and it's crew. one of the visitors, a man in his 50's, has the german eagle and swastika tattooed on his back. the island's senior citizens all remember when a german u-boat was sunk towards the end of world war ii and ever since then there have been rumors of nazi gold in the depths. the grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after german bodies started floating ashore back in 1945. no submarine was ever found.what to expectkey elements are nazi experiments, nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy, and ...a surprise.*** warning - spoiler ***i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard. not being a big fan of supernatural events, it nevertheless fitted well into the story and poses no problem. it's not like "from dusk til dawn" where everybody turns into vampires towards the end. this is a bit more subtle.overall : really good movie, i gave it an 8. some due to the fact that it isn't a hollywood movie with unlimited resources. i later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors were seasoned danish veterans. but even if this had been a hollywood production, i would give it a 7 or 8. definately worth your while. yes, a child's story in a way, but then again a mature tale. it has a lot of suspense and a grand aura of adventure, which i found very appealing. and, again, the cinematography is really nice./medusa 2001

what a pleasant surprise: a disney dtv (direct to video) sequel that's actually good. "the lion king 1 1/2" is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, timon and pumbaa. it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments, until timon complains that "we're not here yet". after fighting over the remote, timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". they start the new movie, and the laughs begin.to be honest, i was losing hope in disney. most of their direct-to-video fare has been aggressively awful, with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new point of view. okay, it adds some stuff, like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. nathan lane and ernie sabella perfectly recapture the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie. there's also some neat movie parodies (including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good, the bad, and the ugly' and 'cool hand luke), and the script is filled with funny memorable lines.added to the cast are julie kavner ("the simpsons") as timon's worry-wart mom, and jerry stiller as timon's slightly crazy uncle max. matthew broderick shows up as simba, and his "teen" scene reminded me of ferris bueller. everyone does well, especially robert guillame (is that how you spell it?) as rafiki, who exudes more and more yoda-speak in this movie (timon comments on this several times).'the lion king 1 1/2' is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the shrekification of animation. 10/10

disney have done it again. brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them. i love this film and watch it over and over again. it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure. then he meets pumbaa and things do change. together, they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail, which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy. then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films. the rest, you already know.

everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! any way, i haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy! of course that's a good thing. it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! like chicken little,, the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying, "twas beauty who killed the beast", war of the worlds scene and more. walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one. also, how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. however some parts don't fit. like in the original lion king, weren't timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar? in this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. ther's more, the reason being why pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it's just timon, timon, timon. anybody realise that only timonn's story was told, whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks?but apart from that , it"s great!

i actually like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. here's just a few:ups: most of the original voice cast returned.downs: i didn't like the voice of timon's ma. i know she did a voice in the simpsons, but that show is just plain stupid. ups: we get to see simba as a "teenager."downs: they wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between timon and simba. ups: it was rafiki who told timon about "hakuna matata."downs: how did pumbaa find out about it?ups: songs again. (some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.)downs: but stupid songs. (a.k.a. timon's solo.)overall, this is a pretty good movie. i'd recommend it for fans of the original. but if you don't like the original, chances are you won't like this one.my score: 7/10

in this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to timon and pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! this film even goes back to before simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of kiara. quite true to the first film, "lion king 1/2 (or lion king 3 in other places)" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). a bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you!while timon and pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), timon and pumbaa have an argument of what point of "the lion king" they are going to start watching, as timon wants to go to the part when he and pumbaa come in and pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. they have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... it starts with timon's first home...for anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age, enjoy "lion king 1/2"! :-)

surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney's straight to video throw away sequels. like the previous sequel (the lion king 2) i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation. the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull. to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences, which much like the jokes, range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge. for the most part the mst3k-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really don't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback. the new characters are at least likable, and the old characters are out doing their thing so i can't fault them there. overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles.

"lion king 1 1/2" is the funniest non-theatrical release from disney. i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years. i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie.is it better than "simba's pride"? in many ways, yes. though "simba's pride" wasn't exactly bad, it did suffer some problems: lack of an good script and bad characterizations, which made impact of what otherwise a okay film.anyway: it's nice to see timon and pumbaa's personalities blossom again in the way that we (or certainly me) loved about them in this film; in "simba's pride" they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the "timon and pumbaa" series neither.this film could easily have been a stupid one, but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious. there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. the score is quite good. there are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, timon's mom, (voiced by recognizable marge simpsons' julie kavner) and uncle max, which are enjoyable. the friendship between timon and pumbaa are touchingly portrayed. the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place, which it could have easily done (especially in comedies).but is there something that distracts this picture from getting 10 votes from me? yes, there is. although they fortunately doesn't impact too much, but i'll mention them: 1. many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one. personally, it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones.2. during the climax, some of the jokes becomes lame.3. storywise, this is timon's story and although the filmmakers try to integrate his tale with simba's, it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times.but hey, those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie. it is the only really acceptable disney sequel, which should be in every movie collection.

finally, timon and pumbaa in their own film...'the lion king 1 1/2: hakuna matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale. which classic tale, you ask? why, 'the lion king' of course!yep, if there's one thing that disney is never short of, it's narcissism.but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film. it's basically the events of 'the lion king' as told from timon and pumbaa's perspective. and it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'the lion king' by heart to see where they're coming from.anyway, at one level i was watching this and thinking "oh my god this is so lame..." and on another level i was having a ball. much of the humour is predictable - i mean, when pumbaa makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one. but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, imo, is 'hakuna matata' in a nutshell. it's not what happens, it's how.and a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage? but as fart jokes go, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur.the returning voice talent is great. i'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky). whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome.the music is also great. from 'digga tunnah' at the start to 'that's all i need', an adaption of 'warthog rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'the lion king' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever.in the end, timon and pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it may be argued that 'hakuna matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it. it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with.am i starting to sound creepy?either way, 'the lion king 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'the lion king' far too many times. especially if you are right now thinking "don't be silly, there's no such thing as seeing 'the lion king' too many times!"

i think lion king 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three lion king movies! in the movie timon and pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as timon having trouble digging tunnels with other meercats! timon and pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping simba face his evil uncle scar and proclaim his right as the lion king of pride rock! filled with wonderful new characters like timon's ma(julie kavner) and uncle max (jerry stiller). i think my favorite character was uncle max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian jerry stiller the father of ben stiller. disney was smart to cast stiller in that role! filled with wonderful characters, animation, and story and music lion king 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than simba's pride even though i will admit i really did like that one too! lion king 1 1/2 is a great disney sequel the whole family can enjoy! it's got a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!

i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out. i was thinking how dumb is disney getting. i was wrong. i found it to be very good. i mean it's not the lion king but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. it was very funny. also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks, it was just like the lion king animation. the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie. not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about. i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return. it was a very good movie over all.

"the lion king" is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time, so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did. lion king 1 1/2 was pretty good and had it's good laughs and fun with timon and pumba. only problem, i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation. well, i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family. it's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first. so, hopefully, i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series. sit back and just think hakuna matata! it means no worries! 8/10

if the lion king is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, the lion king 1 and a half is the total opposite, full of whimsy and cheer. the lion king told the story from the side of simba the young lion, 1 and a half is from the view of timone and pumbaa, a less than perfect duo made up of a meercat who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has an odor issue. the movie is a little short on substance, but disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches starring timone and pumbaa as they "watch" the movie with us. my favorite is the sing-along that happens halfway through the movie, make sure you watch the bouncing bug! disney has advertised 1 and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really isn't. it is just a different perspective of the lion king, without all of the serious stuff that pervaded most of the second half of the original disney classic. credit nathan lane as timone and ernie sabella as pumbaa for their voice work, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. the sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. they also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.

7 if you're a kid- 6 if you claim to be an adult. this semi-sequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba, retelling the original story through their eyes, including the story of how they met. in the grand tradition of disney, inferior sequels are made, and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits. you can be as sceptical as you want about this, but kids and fans of the series will likely not care; their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels. this works because of the charm of the much-loved central characters, the quick pace, the in-jokes involving the first film, and for older viewers there are some funny gags. the animation is as good as ever, if a little less flamboyant than the original, but the plot here is all about taking it easy, hakuna matata.timone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film, frequently stopping mid-film to joke about parts of it, like a real audience. we see how timone is a near outcast, he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home. on the way he meets pumba, another outcast and they become friends. soon they meet simba, a lion cub, natural predator of t and p, but they form a trio. however, when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group, it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not, and how. of course the usual disney elements and themes are here, friendship, good versus evil etc. the plot is simple but works on many levels, making it smarter than your average animated movie. as the cg movies appear, disney's traditional form must become smarter, but not forget the roots which made them popular. toy story and all that have come since have been clever, with jokes to suit all ages, and it seems this is the way the market is shifting. however, there will always be a place for films like this, and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters.7 out of 10

i have to be honest, i was expecting a failure so bad, because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. but that wasn't the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba, the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny. the jacuzzi bubble, and when pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. it's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie. while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end, it works. 8 out of 10

lion king 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. don't expect the production values of a theatrical release, but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release.it is set up as timon & pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story. this is done with frequent comedic interruptions. for example, during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote. these little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor. if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie, than this may not be your cup of tea.animation is the best they've invested in the disney dtv line, and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material. the newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original. the voice talents are all well performed, though i couldn't help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner.many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive.the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature. the toe-tapping opening feature of 'dig a tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. timon and pumba's take on the lion king's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing. the only problem was the reprise of the 'dig a tunnel' at the end of the movie, switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting.story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little. the new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well, and does better when it is resorting to full comedy. overall, worth purchasing. if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it. for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away. damion crowley.

my take: a funny take on the lion king, posing as a sequel. surprisingly amusing. surprisingly, "lion king 1 1/2" is actually another funny straight-to-video, that's worth a theatrical treatment. i don't see why disney released this straight to video, and release crappy movies like "chicken little" and "return to neverland" theatrically. those movies are better off seen in the video stores (in the "new releases" area), rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters.this one is merely a spoof of the first film (although the events in "simba's pride" hasn't taken place yet), on timon (voiced by nathan lane) and pumbaa's (voiced by ernie sabella) point of view. we get to see them make fun of the events in the first film. original voices from the first film, like matthew broderick, woopie goldberg, cheeche martin and robert guillaume, return to their voicing roles from the first film, while julie kavner and jerry stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as timon's mom and grumpy uncle.so doesn't this sound fun. maybe not now, but go watch it for yourself. the fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable. it's kinda like mst3000 with timon and pumbaa.video movie rating: ***1/2 out of 5.

the lion king series is easily the crowning achievement in disney animation. the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in cel animation. lion king ii:simba's pride is the by far the best direct-to-video sequel that disney, or any other studio, has made for an animated feature. it deserved a theatrical release. the same can be said for this movie. it has the original cast, songs by elton john, a hilarious story, exciting action, and touching character moments. everything you've come to expect from this series. not so much a new story, but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa, and their place in this story. what impressed me the most, was the care taken in the animation. all to often, disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. but here, they seamlessly blend new animation with footage from the original film. the scenes never seem out of place. nathan lane and ernie sabella are in full swing as timon and pumbaa. matthew broderick, robert guillame, and moira kelly reprise their roles as simba, rafiki, and nala, respectively. we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech marin as the hyenas.there are many big laughs in this movie. so if you love lion king, you need this movie. the story is just not complete without it.

this is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first lion king, but that said, this was downright good.my kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. the big shock was that *i* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in shrek ["do you think he's compensating for something?"]).a special note on the fart jokes, i was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. i'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.hmm what else? the music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. no painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. a little action but nothing too scary (the secret of nimh gave my kids nightmares, not sure a g rating was appropriate for that one...)all in all i'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (i try not to be overly sensitive but i've had to jump up and turn off the tv during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. i'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)

one of the best movies for all ages. you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds. nearly 40 years old, i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & i have not laughed & enjoyed a movie so much in a long time.take time out and watch this with the kids. it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one.

being a fan of the first lion king, i was definitely looking forward to this movie, but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original. i know that many disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies, as i have mixed feelings of them as well.while watching the lion king 1½, i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie. am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes, or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story? most of the time, i found myself embracing the latter.the lion king 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them. people just love these characters! my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon & pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos.i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though, like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1. i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set (which after all is the target audience. i don't think many kids are really concerned about disney's profit margin on direct-to-video movies.)however, i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie. i'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me. something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me.as for the music, it wasn't too bad, but don't expect any classics to come from this movie. at least lk2 had the nice ballad, "love will find a way." as for the voicework, it was well done in this movie. nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always, and even new cast members, the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner (best known as marge simpson), did a great job also. you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd. that feature is definitely a lot of fun!!so all in all, the lion king 1½ isn't a perfect movie, but it's cute and entertaining. i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun, lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends' perspectives.my imdb rating: 7/10. my yahoo! grade: b (good)

this was one of those wonderful rare moments in t.v. that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs. won't it ever air again? it was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating. i want to see it all again. i want to buy it. i want what i can't have. not even on ebay. so, having ranted enough it was, by far, one of the best series the 80's put out. it should be considered a classic but is lost in space. at least this website and wikipedia mention it. sob.it was utterly appealing, funny, flirtatious, and original. maybe not like sherlock holmes original, i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could.

q.e.d. was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982. i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd!while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild, wild west, the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county, jr., all of which i am a huge fan of,q.e.d. had a much more intellectual quality to it. it did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high. the show ran in the uk as mastermind, and it did have something of the bbc feel to it, but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era.i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially, and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television. i remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that q.e.d. was on, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. wonderful memories.truly, q.e.d. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values today, i would love to see it make a return.

everything i remember about it was excellent... great cast with sam waterston & george innes (before he became more familiar to us audiences).... excellent scripts as only the english can do - edwardian sherlock holmes/lord peter wimsey/albert campion type mysteries, but with a jules verne twist. sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england 80 years earlier... right at the beginning of the scientific/technological revolution of the 20th century.i've often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows. macgyver first aired about 3 years later.i still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape.

i can't remember many details about the show, but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes. unfortunately at the time we had no vcr, so i haven't ever seen the series again. however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on. sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days (i think i was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day, mostly due to his appearance in the series. i would gladly buy/steal/download this series, i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone... any ideas? does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing?

"this man's navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at navy lighter than air (lta) activities. the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. however, the first half of the movie is all about beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother, and getting drake's leg fixed. only then does the second film start. the second film is mostly ltas in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. the look is fairly gritty and realistic, i imagine. then we shift to southeast asia. did the navy have ltas there? never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. and the japs are shooting like mad. shades of vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. this is a blimp we're talking about. in the end, a feel-good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war.

not many movies were made about the lighter-than-air (lta) aspect of aviation, but this is one of them and it's damn good. just a fun film to watch.most of the movie takes place at the navy blimp operations at nas lakehurst (with nas tustin playing the role). wallace beery plays a likable but munchausen-like senior chief ned trumpet, an enlisted pilot, whose tall tales have gotten so frequent nobody really believes him. half the fun is near the end of the movie when events start proving that most of his more outlandish tales are actually true.set during wwii, the main plot centers around bachelor trumpet wooing a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son, jess. told he would never walk without crutches by doctors, chief trumpet pulls some strings and a navy flight surgeon helps in restoring the lad's crippled leg. jess goes on to join the navy to become a flight officer, flying blimps back at lakehurst and facing a whole new set of challenges.a very well-done movie, albeit not without some corny hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisers, and beery's apparent inability to march in step. otherwise this movie gets good grades for technical accuracy, and gives a rare look into the navy's lta operations. the cash register scene, an exchange between trumpet and jess's future love interest cathy, is an absolute hoot.

bunny comes home 'this man's navy' deserves more credit than it gets, a clever script by borden chase, directed by 'wild bill' wellman, the film has just the right feel for early post ww11 euphoria and goodwill, and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later. produced in 1944, the japanese defeated, the battle scenes a little déjà vu, tom drake's melancholy attraction for radiant young jan clayton has solid chemistry, plays real and validates drake's career at metro. the following year jan opened on broadway in 'carousel.' wally beery, a little bleary-eyed, boasts to an always incredulous jimmy gleason his memories an improvement over reality, and give beery a ulysses-like shadow to play against. the navy lta (lighter than air) shots are authentic, photographed at tustin and lakehurst, and the p-38 squadron is out of march afb. lot 3 doubled for india, and bunny's u-turn bunny comes home gives back to beery an authentic slice of his past, something he had wanted to believe was true then, the future we spin into again is fantastical now on a grander scale, a newly designed navy lta with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance plane how expensive, blissfully optimistic still, "you got to believe in it, that's the way you make things come true"

of all the movies i have seen, and that's most of them, this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u.s. naval airships (blimps) during the ww-ii era. yes there are other good lta related movies, but most use special effects more than any real-time shots. this man's navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc. true, lots of corny dialog but that's what makes more interesting hollywood movies, even today. p.s. i spent 10 years(out of 20) and have over 5,000 hours in navy airships of all types, from 1949 through 1959. proud member of the naval airship association etc. [atc(la/ac) usn retired]

of all the versions of the odyssey (or of any greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of scylla & charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some hollywoodish sword-and-sandal b-flick. notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand). at least i did, and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more.

i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty: the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it, but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings. now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema (pasolini etc.), by that time gone. the hollywood epic films are good...for fun. perhaps this 'odyssey' had no english version because is not enough funny... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience. however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflections.in italy was recently released a very good dvd version: integral, with excellent colors. you can find it in some file sharing, but it's italian only, and without subtitles. too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable.

this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies. it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war. it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations, told at list 500 years after those events toke place, around 1100 bc.this is a 1969 movie, so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian, even the close caption is in italian. pity. many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles. but if this is not a problem for you, than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie.

although i have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character,plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded. the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story. the two versions i've seen were dubbed (english and french)but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem. it does not spoil the story telling. among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans. recommended to all followers of odysseus' ever returning.

in all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is to the world's literature. far from being crassly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts.i was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (it should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings, or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis. as in homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary).it's a pity it's not available in dvd, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores.

it's very simple to qualify that movie: "a pure masterpiece". this opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that epoch, 1100 b.c. they personalize perfectly the characters. a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production. among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition. third reason: the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect, in mediterranean regions, where the action of the poem occurred. and most of all, the emotion is on the rendezvous. i repeat my appreciation: "a pure masterpiece".

i've been trying to find out about this series for ages! thank you, imdb! i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind. as a 6-year old, of course, i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops, which was absolutely chilling (i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine, which i still have) what i also remember, though, was the atmosphere, which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious, austere, and extremely authentic. when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation. it's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood. every 'odyssey' i've seen since has been an enormous let-down. the characters in this series seemed genuine, real people - ancient greek people - and not some hollywood stars in costumes. this is a real masterpiece! but - why is it not better known? and why isn't it available on vhs or dvd? i would just love to have the chance to see this again!

as it was already put, the best version ever of homer's epic. entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean. the sea and the sky are strikingly blue, the islands green and untouched. the clothing is linen, wool and fur, the settings stony and bare, everything is somewhat rugged and primitive, a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies, and it makes it all the more authentic. although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural, it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10th century bc might have been like.the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere, but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it. actually, it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer, if not to the text itself. ulysses doesn't appear until the first hour, the start being centered on his son looking after him. then he suddenly appears lost in a storm, lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him. his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts : the terrifying cyclop, the magic world of circe, the underworld, the sirens etc. he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years, and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelope.as a story, the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life. the cast is brilliant and international here. irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope, but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses. really good looking and totally convincing, it seems the role was really made for him. strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards. also playing nausicaa is barbara bach (as barbara gregorini) later famous as the james bond girl in "the spy who loved me", and playing athena is michele breton, who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called "performance" with mick jagger.as it was done 35 years ago, the series was actually quite an innovation for its time, as the first big european co-production for tv (italy, france, germany and yugoslavia). i have seen this mini-series in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974. i was a kid back then, and although it was all in black and white, it left a very vivid impression. all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again, as it was never shown on french tv later on.i recently found a copy on dvd (all in wonderful color) through internet. it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles, although french and german versions existed back then. i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world, and it's quite a shame. if you ever get a chance to watch this, you are not going to forget it ever.there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that. the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic sword-and-sandal like "the 10 commandments", but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story. the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie, based on special effects, sometimes quite gory, very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer's story and atmosphere.

documenting a documenter. that's one way to describe keep the river on your right: a modern cannibal tale. this film follows anthropologist tobias schneebaum, who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a participant field researcher over 40 years ago, first to west papua and then peru. tobias is a full-bodied character: a gay jewish artist anthropologist who eeks out a living on a cruise ship teaching gawking tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for. author of several books documenting his time with both the asmat people of west papua and the cannibalistic amazonians in peru, tobias has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become. yet tobias' constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch. one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.tobias makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in immersing himself in these two tribal societies has left him fundamentally changed. this film challenges the notions of morality and "naturalness"- e.g. nudity, homosexuality, cannibalism. (watch for the graphic circumcision scene). when questioned as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally denounce, his non-judgmental nature asks: "why not?" who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong? this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national geographic types, but also those interested in the art of documentary making. this film shows what can be done shot on video. the editing provides a quiet revelation of tobias' life that leaves you watching in fascination. at times, he despairs at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back, especially considering his age and physical frailty. we can be but grateful that tobias allowed the tables to be turned on himself, perhaps sympathising with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world. the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance, presenting for example one anthropologist who believes that tobias predetermined his findings (of homosexuality in this case) based on his personal interests. that said, you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a cuddle. move over river queen, this is the best river ride i've taken in a while.

having just finished cronicles of the heroic knight mere minutes ago i find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me. while it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first record of lodoss war the truth is that they really aren't. it would appear that the creator of cothk had a different vision as to how the original ended (and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur) but i do not find that to be the case. cothk does say it starts 5 years after the war of heros which parn was a part of. i think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into spark's story. now, once the series does kick into spark's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years (15 years now since the war of heros). spark and his crew do, in some cases, resemble parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear, especially the love story that brews between spark and neese. i also thought several times throughout cothk that i threw in the original series and if it wasn't for spark's long blue hair i know i would've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in. by no means do i consider these major set backs however, the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline. the only thing that makes me hurt is that ashram and wagnard return. ummmm... how??? don't get me wrong both are great villains even though ashram's only villainous trait is that he supports the marmo. perhaps i missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part. as far as sequels go though, i highly recommend cothk. i place both cothk and, even more so, the original record of lodoss war far above the lord of the rings trilogy. both of these are more epic than anything i've ever seen or read. i highly recommend this.

no, this isn't a sequel to the fabulous ova series, but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim (and the disappearance of woodchuck). it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series, which is why characters (namely orson and shiris) are reintroduced, and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova. (the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions, as do various online sites.) the first eight episodes of this 27-part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain. the remaining 19 episodes introduce us to spark, a blue-haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn, and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer.while it isn't quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war (we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard, don't we?), this tv follow-up is still great fun for fantasy fans. even if the animation is limited (and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss), this 27-part series has its elements of appeal. the fully-realized characters, engaging storyline, magic, romance, and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll, all give this uneven spin-off some punch.while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another, i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs. so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles, made in 1999-2000. for the most part, the lodoss tv english track is of passable (if not stellar) quality; it does, however, have its share of problems. much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return (including lisa ortiz as deedlit!), which is a nice bonus. on the other hand, billy regan's more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting. he doesn't do a bad job, but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes (causing some anti-dub fans to instantly diss the dub), but by the time spark and company take the stage, i found it less bothersome. (i don't know if it's because he improved or if it just grew on me.) also, not everyone from the oav dub returns. jayce reeves only voices wagnard (terrifically) for one episode; he's replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show, who gives a scratchy, but still malevolent turn (as well as the expected evil laughter). anthony cruise's kashue, on the other hand, is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride. oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson, especially during his final dramatic scenes.aside from lisa ortiz (deedlit), karen smith (shiris), john knox (ashram), and al muscari (slayn), the dub's best voices come from some of the newer characters, including crispin freeman (spark, maar, garrack -episodes 16-27-), roxanne beck (little neese), meg frances (who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla) and especially angora deb (who steals every scene she's in as leaf the half-elf). the rest of the cast isn't terrible by any means, but a little more uneven than the oav dub. some are all right (aldonova, greevus) while others are lackluster (hobb, palace guards, dragons, etc.) and few were awful (in particular, prince reona's va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice).in fact the lack of aural continuity (some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes) is one of the problems of the dub. others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue, uneven synchronization, and finally (i apologize in advance to the fans of this) the lodoss island segments. these offbeat, super-deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty. admittingly, i at first found them to be a major nuisance, but they sorta grew on me after a while. (besides, there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as "i'm king kashue, and this is my cashew! i'm really quite a nut!") these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova, resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as "ok".if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice, well, guess what? the japanese version has its good and bad points, too. while some voices are less annoying than the english language track, i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents (in particular, the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma). plus, i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova. because the series was made seven years after the original, all but one (sho hayami) of the cast members are replaced by new ones. although they do a respectably good job, it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast. shows that not everything in japanese is better than english, eh? despite its flaws, chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground. its not without its rough spots and doesn't always live up to its predecessor, yet there's enough good points to counter the bad, making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime.

i saw this film at amsterdam's international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum, all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers. the film's title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. his reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving. i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.

i read schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of "otherness" (his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. his subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men intrude on traditional societies. even so, schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.

domini enfilren (marlene dietrich) has spent most of her life caring for her father. now that he has died she is free--but doesn't know what she wants. boris androvsky (charles boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. they meet accidentally in algiers, fall in love and get married. but he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him...way overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations. dietrich and boyer do their best to give good performances but nobody could get away with some of their lines! still, in a way, it is a classic. it's shot in gorgeous technicolor (try to see it on dvd) where every frame is breath-takingly beautiful. dietrich is always dressed to the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body. boyer just walks around looking stricken (no shock there). still i was never bored. it was wonderful to look at and the non-stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches. the end almost had me falling out of my chair because i was laughing so hard! now i love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really---this is unbelievable! it also runs a very short 80 minutes.as a camp classic i give this an 8. as a serious movie--a 1.

the pioneering technicolor cinematography (winner of special technical achievement oscar) is indeed enchanting. add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer, and you've got a rather pleasant "picture".unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired. still, there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one (1936), and very few since then, that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors. cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in "robin hood" (1938), "jesse james" (1939) and "gone with the wind" (1939), will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here. "the garden of allah" will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography.

"the garden of allah" is a prime example of "popular women's literature", turn of the xxth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of catholic guilt. just as jane eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins, or the heroine of "rebecca" couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife (and her castle burned down around her), or poor psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid's secret at all costs, domini, the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe, can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows. like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours, this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book: basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late. the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act. it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards. oh well... it could have been much worse and it often was...without the religious overtones, the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick: oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic, shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery, all passion spent, leaving her to clean up his mess. and i really resent another commentator's comparison with anatole france's "thais", a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression, some of which transpired in massenet's opera of the same name, thankfully.but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism, of course, is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering, vibrant life. imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all, a truckload of worthy character actors (including one cute dog), a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the "composed film" that michael powell (who, ironically, had a bit part in the 1927 silent version) always dreamed about, tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic, operatic exoticism, a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object, characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next, dialog is sparse, vague and suggestive, the art direction is close to celestial, flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent, the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats, saints, doomed but horny sinners, mystics or poets.ahh... hollywood! the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable. the bit rate is very high throughout, the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner's score and to boyer's penultimate confession.a historical note on this sort of "women's subject": the following year (1937), julien duvivier, visibly inspired by "the garden of allah", directed "carnet de bal", where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine (widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book. she finds them all in time, only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood, overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences. it was duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later.

gorgeous techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a trappist monk who has left his monastery, breaking his vows. the film opens at a convent in europe, where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named domini (marlene dietrich). she is advised by the mother superior to go to the desert and "find herself", and lose her grief over her father who has recently died. in the train car on the way into the sahara she sits opposite a very, very troubled man (charles boyer) - our former monk. she's soon at a hotel near a palm-treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. domini becomes friends with him, though knows nothing of his past - romance soon to follow.this film is sentimental, melodramatic, and different (in a way, almost surreal and even a bit campy) - i found it to be quite fun and entertaining. the photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial close-ups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted figures against a sunset sky. marlene dietrich gives a nicely done, though restrained, performance here and looks gorgeous. charles boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this, i think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too. basil rathbone is fine here, except given very little to do. another great orchestral score by max steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all, a very enjoyable film.

audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length technicolor film. i can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip). at any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd. in fact, just how good it looks is amazing.kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski, director of photography virgil miller, selznick international pictures and, for the dvd - mgm home entertainment. all of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.i thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. it gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. i can't say more without spoiling things.marlene dietrich never looked better, i don't believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character ("domini enfilden"). heart-throb charles boyer was the male star and domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. people like joseph schildkraut as "batouch;" john carradine as "the sand diviner;" the most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer "irena," played by tilly losch. wow, there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed. just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd. looking at her imdb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.basil rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing "sherlock holmes," also is in here as is c. aubrey smith, another famous british actor of his day. schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, "the shop around the corner," with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan.the beautiful direction, photography and color, and tilly's dance, are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one. had the last half hour been better - although i admire the ending - i would have rated it even higher. it's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.

"the garden of allah" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip technicolor films. to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature (after disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's "becky sharp" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes."the garden of allah" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. that being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat.

in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! i had no idea that technicolor came out so early. although i didn't like the ending, the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa. the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick. basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie. i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets... the hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there... the legionnaires also bring a "beau geste" feeling to the film. they certainly don't make movies like these anymore. don't fail to watch this classic!

marlene dietrich and charles boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. the irony is that dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous. she look great; boyer looks young and trim.story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by max steiner, and a good supporting cast. the film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.joseph schildkraut is funny as the arab guide, c. aubrey smith is the old priest, lucile watson the mother superior, tilly losch the dancer, john carradine the diviner, and basil rathbone plays.... well i'm not sure. he just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! as others have noted, john gilbert was slated to star with dietrich. i can't help but think he would have been wonderful. the role of world-weary boris would have suited the great gilbert quite well. and after the success of queen christina (with garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.i can't think of any other 30s film dietrich did in color. she looks great and wears some terrific clothes. my favorite is the valentino as the shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars.

i give this movie an a+ for the sheer camp of it! as dietrich's daughter maria riva wrote in the book on her mother, "if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp, it can be very amusing." and how! i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. viewers who've read the accounts of boyer's toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!). dietrich's costumes are out of this world. as riva notes in her book, dietrich managed to steal paramount's travis banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns, such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.i heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor. it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.in short, if you watch the garden of allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness, you can't help but enjoy it.

north africa in the 1930's. to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith. they will meet and passions will be stirred, but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow, here, in the garden of allah.the plot is pure hokum, but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at. marlene dietrich & charles boyer are a superb screen couple. she is, to put it simply, gorgeous, and boyer gives a most effective, understated performance, letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him. the supporting cast is excellent: basil rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert; joseph schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (all the "arabic" he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish); lucile watson as a gentle mother superior; alan marshal as an honorable young french officer; tilly losch as a dangerous dancer; henry brandon as a comic porter; john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner; and magnificent sir c. aubrey smith as a wise old priest.movie mavens will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun; marcia mae jones & bonita granville (peeking over the nun's shoulder) as convent girls; gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector; and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk, all uncredited.color films of the 1930's are both rare & lovely to look at, and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. the garden of allah was the first technicolor film to be shot on location. yuma, arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt. when the daily rushes showed boyer's face had burned a bright tomato red, producer david o. selznick finally gave in. the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage.

just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is. rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement. lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens. amores perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now. i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise. if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in. fortunetly this is not that movie. the people tell the story! this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them. there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense. touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story. i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen.

this interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind tibetan children trekking in the himalayas; but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people. on one hand, there is erik weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb everest, and the team of (sighted) mountaineers who are guiding the kids. on the other, there is sabriye tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind tibetans, who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing. at some level, sabine simply doesn't understand the mountaineer's philosophy (with it's emphasis on summitting); she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with, especially as she has an effective veto. in the background to this (reasonably well-mannered) clash, we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves. i enjoyed the film, although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even though it details the quarrel, the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are. but it's hard to argue with that assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly.

this film was amazing. it is an inspiring piece of cinema. the characters are fully developed through the truth in which director, lucy walker brings to the film. i highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition. lucy wlaker showcases the landscape beauty. this film id a true example of man vs. nature and sometimes man vs. man. the inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter. the subject of how the tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. this film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased. lucy walker has given erik weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard. thank you lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker.

i saw this film at the toronto international film festival. i loved this, and not just for the obvious reasons. blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of mount everest's sister peaks. now, this kind of thing is usually a can't miss. inspirational. moving. pretty standard, right? and even if the film were just that, i'd still have liked it. but it was so much more. blind herself, german sabriye tenberken established a school for blind children in tibet, in a culture that sees blindness as a curse, as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life. many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives, and at best, are a burden to their families. as part of their education, tenberken shares with them the story of american erik weihenmayer, the first blind person to reach the summit of mount everest. she sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students. instead, he comes up with a plan. he'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot lhakpa ri and provide all the guides and equipment. sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.erik's team are mostly american, mostly male, and mostly sighted. as experienced mountaineers, they're type-a personalities, very gung-ho and goal-oriented. sabriye is european, female, and blind, and the students for her are more than a "project," no matter how well-intentioned. additionally, the students are tibetan, and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves. as the expedition unfolds, they become pawns in between the two adult "sides," wanting to please both, while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment. as an additional obstacle (other than being blind, that is), they are speaking english as a second or in most cases, a third language, and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.when it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience, and that some are much more coordinated than others, it begins to unravel erik's original plan for them all to reach the summit together. as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude, decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain. among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability, and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults. at the risk of oversimplifying, on one side are those for whom the destination is all, and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey. i won't tell you how it all turns out, except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought-provoking stories i've seen in a long time.the film also weaves bits of each climber's story into the narrative, and this was sorely needed, since once on the climb, the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut. with all the drama going on around them, that wasn't surprising. the backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking, and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end. this was contrary to my expectations, and another pleasant surprise.in addition to all the human drama to cover, director walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen-deprived conditions herself, lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldn't break down. as with all great documentaries, the filmmaker was just lucky enough (or smart enough, or prepared enough) to be at the right place at the right time, and she's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do "what's best for the kids" as it does about the kids themselves.

before seeing this, i was put off by the subject matter, but this is not your average triumph over adversity story. although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt. everest, there is so much more to it. this movie shows the very strong, often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children, erik and sabriye. erik is an american blind mountain climber/athlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet. they are both exceptional in their own ways, but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids. erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment. the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea. the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school. the most moving for me was the story of tashi, a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him. i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school, he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students. if you liked spellbound or murderball, you will love this.

** warning - contains spoilers! **first of all, i would like to say that i really liked this game. i got it for christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents. i am glad that i did that.first off, i would like to say that the single player was very good. the first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are at a party in london, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes. the best part, and i think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet-pack, and people are rappelling down big ben. just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down. pure fun!the rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short. there are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the let downs, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives, i mean, c'mon! we got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!the multi player, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no bots. halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games! you can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character.gameplay - 8.5/10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved). graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often). multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles). sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10 (the only levels i go back on are the loondon level and istanbul part 1).i give this game: 8.5/10could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good.

ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional. i got this game april 2007 (two years after release), and i am still impressed with the gameplay. it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games.i give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over. the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level, it was too much pressure. on the whole i like the game a lot!!

this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because: the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good. the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play. the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie. the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game. also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.overall score ********** out of **********

the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy: step into the shoes of agent 007. "frwl" comes closer to this goal than any other game, because this time you control the real james bond. no offense to pierce brosnan, who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to "eon", but sean connery was the original james bond, and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool.i must say at this point, like many others who have reviewed this game, that sean 70 year old voice doesn't fit his 30 year old image on screen, and this takes some getting used to, but it's certainly worth it. he makes lines like "bond james bond" and "shaken, not stirred" into a big deal again. but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is, as bond said in "octopussy", "only the tip of the tentacle." the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. it's the original gun barrel from the movies. then you take on first mission, rescuing the prime minister's hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament, and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro. the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond, right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game, as bond infiltrates a secret factory.after the game's opening, the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie "frwl." james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him. in turkey, bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey. bond must retrieve the device, protect the damsel in distress, and get both safely back to london. bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script, and he's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie. the characters from the movie are all recreated well, but some are better than others. the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny. and there's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny, m, and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery 007 movies.what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games, besides sir sean's voice and likeness, is two notable features in the game play. one is bond focus. while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other, an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at, such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death. the other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills. when you're in close enough range, just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connery's james bond displayed.sean connery's bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent, so you only have a few gadgets, but they're good ones. the q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas bond can't reach, like the q-spider in "eon", only better. the classic laser watch is useful, not just for getting into sealed rooms, but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available. sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with, but you must experience them for yourself. besides the gadgets, you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game, including the gray suit from the movie, the standard black tuxedo, a retro stealth suit, and that classic white tuxedo, all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies. when you drive in the game, you drive the aston martin db5 straight out of "goldfinger." it can't turn invisible, but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie. and when you're not flying down the streets of istanbul in the "goldinger" car, you can fly through the air in the "thunderball" jet pack.then there's the multi-player. of course, it has to be compared to the standard of the "goldeneye" game, and it fails. also, you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game. but the multi-player is amusing, and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing. the basic game does have other flaws. some of the movie's most exciting moments, particularly the gypsy camp shootout, bond's brawl with red grant on the orient express, and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebb's bladed shoe, aren't done justice in game form. and the game is a fast play, even on the hardest difficulty. but overall, this game is the best james bond experience so far.

good: engaging cinematic firefights, great presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, fairly appealing multiplayer, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on.bad: main missions are a bit short.this game defines what a "good" third person shooter(not necessarily a spy-game) is. great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete every single mission through, and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer. the hype this game had, was lived up to, and i personally think you should buy it, and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one. loads of fun. the sound in this game, is a rip-roaring achievement from a few previous bond games, and firing a weapon, really feels like you're firing a weapon. it ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.all in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through, and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty james bond "nightfire" game for gamecube.

i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. i am glad i did. it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game. i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie/game remake. the bonus levels were very hard! the sniper one i think was too hard, it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half. there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. the only thing i might change was the upgrade system. i didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. i really liked the q copter. i think the developers did a good job.

why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie???!!! the cast gives some good performance (elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl, ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin, a guy eternally lessened by his bother), but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original. i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen! julie corman (the producer): are you crazy???!!!

forget the jaded comments that come before these. this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting. well-acted, even by elizabeth berkley. recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change.

picture the scene: a mountainous alien landscape. twin moons illuminate the blood red sky. the tardis lands, and out steps the doctor, a middle-aged man in a victorian frock coat, and rose, his companion from earth. a flicker of recognition crosses his face. "well, i never! its the planet saurious-7. where i fought the warlike kraggartians. they tried to use giant skinkons to take over the planet.". the girl sniffs the air. "can't we go, doctor. i don't like the look of this place. i keep thinking we're being watched.". the doctor wags a disapproving finger. "don't be silly, girl. i wonder if the king and queen of cordaraby city remember me from my last visit. come along, rose, come along!". he strides off, the girl struggles to keep up. high on a hill, sinister red eyes regard them with hatred... that was not how 'rose' began back in 2005, and thank heavens for that say i. unfairly derided at the time of its original u.k. broadcast, 'rose' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode, putting 'dr.who' back where it belonged, as one of the b.b.c.'s flagship programmes. the mistakes made by the mcgann t.v. movie were well learnt. instead of trying to shoehorn the new 'who' into existing chronology, it represented a fresh start for the series, beginning with shop girl rose tyler ( billie piper ) going about her daily routine. one day she goes to the basement to find a man named wilson, and then the trouble begins. mannequins come to life and attack her. it is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger ( christopher eccleston ) that she is saved. the story, slight though it may be, is more than adequate as a starting-point for the series. the autons are, of course, an old villain ( this was their first appearance since 1971 ), but no references are made to their past appearances - another wise move. the finale effectively recreated the famous scene in 'spearhead from space' when shop window dummies sprang to life. as the doctor, christopher eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors, preferring a modern leather jacket to the doctor's traditional period clothes, but this made him more accessible to the show's hoped-for new audience. billie piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as 'rose'. also good was noel clarke as her boyfriend 'mickey'.yes, there was an added emphasis on special effects, but then there needed to be - the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television. what is more important is how good a script this is. ten million people tuned in to see the new doctor.'dr.who' was back - and back with a bang!

they did it. and, boy, did they do it fantastically or what! the bbc finally brought the doctor back to our screens on a saturday evening where he belongs! and they did it with style! episode one: "rose" - one of the strengths of the new series is russel t davies as a writer and executive producer. he's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want, but also is an experienced writer in his own right, so knows what other people want. another strength, as perfectly shown here in this first episode, is billie piper and her character of rose tyler. finally the doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. also nice to see the return of the autons - a nice nod to the classic series there.episode two: "the end of the world" - in the start of this double bill to show off the tardis' strengths, we end up in a story where special effects is everything! they now have the technology to create real, believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits of sorts! also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new doctor's past - very intriguing to kill off all the time lords and make him the only one.episode three: "the unquiet dead" - we've had the future, now lets have the past. the first non-davies written episode is a little flat in some places, but this is made up for by simon callow's charles dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful gelf are not so pitiful after all...episode four: "aliens of london" - the consequences of the doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, not least with the repercussions of rose running off with him. also, we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of ones admittedly. the slitheen are an interesting villain, though they can look too cgi for their own good.episode five: "world war three" - the second part of this story about the slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first. also, the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people.episode six: "dalek" - yes! we've had the future, the past, and the present(ish), but now we get to the good stuff - the return of the doctor's arch-nemesis. here i think we can complement christopher ecclestone - he was brilliant as the doctor, and no more so then in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he recollects the time war and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a dalek himself.episode seven: "the long game" - really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale. saved by simon pegg as the smarmy editor and tamsin grieg in an amusing cameo. the media are controlling us - that's never been done before, has it...episode eight: "father's day" - this is a great episode. full of human emotion and heartache for rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history. full marks to billie piper here.episode nine: "the empty child" - i don't find this kid very scary. sorry, but i don't. it's a good episode though, but the cliffhanger still could have been better - it's those "next time" bits that spoil them. john barrowman is introduced here as captain jack, the dashing conman - he's a good actor who's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now.episode ten: "the doctor dances" - part two of this ww2 story - very well made in historical context terms. a nice upbeat ending, though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the "mummy" is revealed? episode eleven: "boom town"- probably the weakest of the series, but that doesn't mean its bad. a nice return for the slitheen and also an interesting character study of the doctor and rose.episode twelve: "bad wolf" - this starts off quite silly, with some good-hearted humour and cheeky fun making at popular tv shows over her in blighty. things turn deadly serious quickly, though, and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! episode thriteen: "parting of the ways" - goodbye christopher ecclestone. a fantastic doctor in so many ways, david tennant is having to really work his socks off to be as good as him. the regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. oh, and the daleks are back - in the extreme! god bless cgi, because they'd never be able to pull this off normally! overall - brilliant! 9/10

as essential a part of british pop culture as the monty python and james bond, doctor who was a massive hit for 26 years (1963-1989), making it one of the longest running tv shows in the world (most serials are lucky to have ten seasons). plans to reboot the series were always on the bbc's agenda, and after a miscalculated (not to mention americanized) tv movie produced by fox failed to capture the magic of the original version, another nine years (comic relief spoof and animated mini-series notwithstanding) were required before the ultimate time lord could return properly, courtesy of acclaimed writer russell t. davies.davies' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider: rose tyler (billie piper), a london-based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic. she is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the doctor (christopher eccleston) and then disappears after quipping: "nice to meet you, rose. run for your life!". as she gets more and more curious about this "man", she soon finds herself in a whole new world: aliens, invasions, travel through time and space, and of course, the omnipresent police box-shaped tardis.the first 45 minutes of the new doctor who are almost perfect (the special effects could have used a bit more polishing) because davies nails two things: the show's unique humor and the two protagonists. the original series' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci-fi and pure british comedy, a hybrid that's hard, if not impossible, to export. here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between rose and the doctor, who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode. okay, so technically eccleston's doctor is the ninth to use that name, but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a northern accent (the one he uses on a daily basis) and justifying it with a terrific line: "lots of planets have a north!". the real triumph of this episode, though, is piper's performance: in theory, rose is in her late teens, therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the doctor before. her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new, exciting universe, represents the new generation's reaction to the return of a tv icon, and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and eccleston is a sign indicating the new doctor who is just as good as the old one.first, fifth, ninth, it makes no difference: there may have been others before eccleston (and piper, for that matter) but together he, william hartnell, peter davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character, one so cool he doesn't even need a name: he's the doctor.

as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up. even the grim ripper made us smile. those two alien things made me laugh, bill and ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie. this is a lot better than the first one. and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something. something big. something important. made a better house and girlfriends. no, i'd say better villains. use clones instead of robots.i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks.the grim ripper, don't be scared he's not the deathy kind, is funny. when he fell from the sky i split a gut. splat, i'm not sure about those aliens. what where they? scientists? no way.

this movie is awesome. if you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, it's quantity of "dudes" and "right ons" brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago. i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness, and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor, "bill and ted's excellent adventure" (1989). if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes, and totally mature humor, don't watch it; however, if you want a film that is humorous and silly, yet intelligent and engaging, you will enjoy it. i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today's theatres. and hey, it's keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting...right...doesn't get much better than that :)

two years later... bill (alex winter) and ted (keanu reeves) are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their instruments. in the future, bill & ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man (joss ackland) is set to kill bill & ted by sending cyborg look-likes to destroy them. cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill & ted. now, both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future.directed by peter hewitt (tom and huck, the borrowers) made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects. much more funny and entertaining than the original. william sadler (the shawshank redemption) steals the show as the grim reaper.dvd has an good anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound. dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette. this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also (believe it or not), one of the best sequels ever made (depending on your point of view). george carlin reprises his role from the original briefly. pam grier also appears in a bit role. it's a enjoyable fantasy comedy. (****/*****).

it may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly, it's pretty cheesy, but it's just so much fun! nothing makes me smile like bill and ted. lovable, optimistic, and hilarious, bill and ted are a great way to unwind.although i love excellent adventure, bogus journey is funnier to me. death is flippin hilarious and bill and ted are even more endearing. people give me grief about loving this movie, but only really pretentious movie-watchers will say it's not even a bit entertaining. if you like this, you'll probably also be a fan of wayne's world, dude where's my car, and dumb and dumber. admit it, though foolish, they make you grin and turn your tickle box over. so watch them just for kicks and giggles!!

bill and ted's bogus journey is the sequel to bill and ted's excellent adventure. their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie, and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer.the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted. once the robots kill bill and ted, they must compete with the grim reaper (death) and return their lives to normal.the acting in the movie is top notch, and even thought it is a little weird at times, especially bill and ted's conversations, it is a great movie. the wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie. pick this up the next time your at blockbuster!

alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie.the only difference is that their trip is "somewhere" between heaven and hell and ends up being both. when they meet the grim reaper, they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have. besides playing roles they have...er...perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet).the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with "what it might be like" instead of "what was." without spoiling the movie, i can't give you anymore information about this (i guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.

now this is more like it! the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting, but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through.seriously, this is just full of great stuff, brimming with creativity, and it's less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time. the scenes in hell are great, and so are the ones in heaven. there's really no shortage to the mad-cap adventurous romp that this one promises, and you will never see another movie like this. even the hammy final act of the movie isn't as bad as the first one, being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely cliché repertoire of family fun movie bliss. and even keanu reeves, despite looking about 30, isn't that bad here.sounds like a good deal to me.

okay, i'll admit it--i am a goof-ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy. while i have seen more films by kurosawa, bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny. a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail, uhf, start the revolution without me, strange brew and the bill and ted movies. they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them.while bill & ted's bogus journey isn't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film, it still is great fun. also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs. but, every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the grim reaper. and, by the way, this reaper is about as different from bergman's in the seventh seal as you can get!! in addition to a lot of laughs, this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film. the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes--provided you aren't an old killjoy like de nomolos. great viewing for kids and adults alike.

will and ted's bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality, religion, time, heaven and hell, man's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine. it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art- dante, iron maiden, virgil, shakespeare. this time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past- napolean, joan of ark (noah's wife), oscar wilde, and charles darwin. they took the skills they learned from each of these people, abducted a couple of princesses, and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs. these songs teach the world to love again and war, hunger, evil are vanquished for eternity. we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called simon cow-al wants to rule the world. he eats rooshus (the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin) and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time. the cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel, and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact. it is their job to kill the good biff and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no-one could like. by doing this they will change the world forever- gryll and jed's music will never be made leaving a world of war, famine, and hatred, and more annoyingly, bland boy/girl group pop music. there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world, themselves, and their wives from the evil dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies.penelope spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references, and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves. she presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism, self love, and malaise of the time. charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message, but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares. to overcome is to succeed, to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving. in the words of kenneth reeves- 'wow!' best scene: for a fun game- see how many songs, bands, and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film. there are at least 6.

visual creative epic of inimitable style.this film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting. but who dares to say this film is no art? i'm not a supporter of the idea, that an important film must be serious, non-commercial or bothering me with questions. even there are a lot of films, apposite to this attributes, that i like.bogus journey, for sure, is not one of this films. what you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive charged, childlike energy. this film doesn't reflect reality. its friendly-naive and utopian. imagine the world of the future described by rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time-place combination to live in! except of that music ;- )technically, bogus jorney is very well made. i always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie. especially in this point bogus journey tops its prequel by far. also the effects are good, and i think most of them very made without cgi. i generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. sure its 'just another hollywood movie' out of some peoples view. but i think it is this in a very charismatic way.a short word to the soundtrack: all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film. also the sound design has no lack. i am not a big fan of rock music, but i had to get this track by winger from the scene 'station' builds the bill and ted robots in the van. i love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning.let me conclude saying this:this film is very naive and very imaginative! it is way better than panzerkreuzer potemkin, the godfather, eraserhead or aguirre - the wrath of god. it is absolutely superior to citizen kane, apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil... ...it is even better than total recall... no way!? yes way!bill and ted's bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made.who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of "artsie-fartsy behavior" or likes terminator salvation (what is the bigger self-defamation)ps: part 1 is not the better movie. so bogus jorney is a superior sequel. not even terminator 2 is a superior sequel! its not!

go way back to page ten of this review section, and work your way back up. go ahead; i'll wait.done? well, then you've probably noticed the same trend that i have. you could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes, dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in 'bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now, love me later" flicks.bill and ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion. that worked fine for the original, but obviously bombed in 1991, when no self-unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80's. as ted would put it: "dude, this is a totally deep hole. wanna play 20 questions?" they say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles, and that certainly seems to be the case here. here in 2010, those of use who grew up with cindi lauper and megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that (like it or not) made us who we are. if you're one of those who look at 'bogus' as if it were an outdated ("fa gs!") ripoff, then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed.in self-referencing its own origins (the star trek episode" and and time traveling with a phone booth), b&t makes no attempt to hide its creators' love for homage. quentin tarantino, anyone? i'm not saying 'bogus' is 'true love,' but i do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is: a fun snap-shot of our society at a time before child psychology, ritalin, anti-smoking ads, terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear-mongering. so, for all of you b&t haters out there...turn off your screaming trees cd, get that hair out of your face, go to the beach and lighten up. narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are so corporate.

i realize that alot of people hate this movie, but i must admit that it is one of my favorites. i happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies.first off, i think that people never give the story any credit, much like back to the future, time travel is hard to write, and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey.i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie, they looked cooler, acted cooler, and said cooler things.the set design of this movie is awsome as well, the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell...but isnt that the genius of the whole franchise, making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth.the costume design was awsome as well. bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey, where as in excellent adventure they look rather like, well as they would put it, fags!!!even the music in this movie is awsome, the score especially. there so much i could say about this film, cause i love it. but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more, so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure (which i also love by the way).get down with your bad self!!!!

oh, come on, learn to have a little fun. when i was a kid, oh, this movie was oscar-worthy to me. i thought it was absolutely hysterical. one of the best movies i had seen.now, it's a little stupid, but come on. if you enjoyed "excellent adventure", you should most likely have fun with "bogus journey". this was the movie before "dude, where's my car?". only this one is actually funny. like i said, it's just a good time. it shouldn't be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one, you should like "bogus journey". it's just a funny movie with some memorable characters. for your enjoyment only, watch it, let go, and remember that it's a silly comedy. that's all.7/10

when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world? if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching "bill and ted's bogus journey." this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch, keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from "bill and ted's excellent adventure" with even more 'style' then they had in 1st movie. it's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh, the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh. don't expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls' just expect pure fun!

1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: terminator 2: judgment day and bill & ted's bogus journey. out of the two, i've always liked bill & ted's bogus journey a bit better. terminator 2: judgment day is the better made, but there's just nothing like bill and ted. besides chris farley and david spade in tommy boy, it's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than bill and ted. they are one of a kind.seemingly influenced by national lampoon's o.c. and stiggs, bill and ted were created by ed solomon and chris matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in l.a. back in the 1980s. the two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long bill & ted's excellent adventure was born. the film, shot in 1987 and released in 1989, became a big box office success and an instant cult classic. it wasn't long before work began on the sequel. stephen herek, the director of 'excellent adventure' wasn't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean-spirited and unlike the first one so peter hewitt, making his feature film debut, was brought in to direct the sequel. there couldn't have been a better director for the job. bill & ted's bogus journey is marvelously directed. it's filled with its own unique style and energy that can't be matched.what makes 'bogus journey' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original, it is just as fun. it doesn't change the characters like most sequels do. bill and ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film. this is because it was written by the original writers. most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one, but since 'bogus journey' had the same screenwriters, it ended up being just as good as 'excellent adventure' if not even better. just like the first one, 'bogus journey' is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun, and above all, original. it's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from alex winter, keanu reeves, and william sadler. it's an unforgettable 'journey'. 10/10

bill and ted's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched. though the acting and scenery etc is poor, who cares. the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent, the ideas are great as well. i recommend anyone to see this classic. the best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death, i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film. this is so much better then the first one, which was great as well. possibly the funniest movie of all time!!!!! i think the best parts of the film however, are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo, it was hilarious. rock on bill, ted and eddie van halen, bring out a 3rd film!!

bill and ted are back, only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil bill and ted to destroy them, thus destroying 'wyld stallions' and the basis for human society in the future. this time bill and ted have to travel through the afterlife 'totally bogus' and save humanity 'excellent'with much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper, station and robot bill and ted (stations creation) bogus journey once again entertains, and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone.7/10 a most triumphant sequel party on dudes! hehe

in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure, bill and ted are under threat from the future, as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted, in order to change the future.in a great comedy pairing, winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel. though lacking the sharpness of the first, bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky. this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.the first watch i hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, bogus journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.

my take: a goofy, yet imaginative mess. keanu reeves (yes! that keanu reeves) and alex winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure, now a cult classic. in this sequel, bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time. they might as well travel heaven and hell too! during the beginning of this sequel, bill and ted are preparing for a "battle of the bands" competition which may make them more famous than ever. meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (the always watchable george carlin) is running a university praising bill and ted's names. there, an evil tyrant (joss ackland, from the hunt for red october) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock-stars once and for all. so he sends two identical android replicas (in the words of bill and ted: robot us's) to do the dirty job.there after, bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell, with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories, and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends... and their show. along this whacked-out voyage, they play board games with none other than death (william sadler, from die hard 2), reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal, aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.bogus journey's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren't up to to-date standards, and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated (to be honest, the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year, even for the 90's). but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction, bill and ted's bogus journey is fun, imaginative, and yes, bogus.rating: ***1/2 out of 5.

what can i say? i know this movie from start to finish. it's hilarious. it's an strong link to my past and will change the way i view film in the future. hypothetically speaking :) the down-fall? there's no socrates johnson!

anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked. it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer, but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time. one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor, bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again. notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending, which is highly "emotional". keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best, ted theodore logan in bill and ted: the return.

the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen. it was a bad version of 'back to the future' with zero charm. once accepted that bill & ted are nitwits, the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.this is a surprise. this is your only spoiler warning...by today's standards, this is more fun. this was shunned upon release, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. we get the photographer of 'face/off', the editor of 'fugitive', a production designer from burton's early work, and the sound designer of 'matrix'.the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep. since this was shunned by the fanbase and public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. it's not, it fits the material. like 'death becomes her' and 'catch-22', this dares to be smart, but we like our movies "simple" so we don't buy it. probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. what's so good?--nice self-reference towards keanu; from airhead to messiah. see also arnold schwarzenegger.--joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he makes his own hatred. the evil b&t and the "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their originals: lesser copies and depreciation of language.--the "duality" motif. nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles, lots of high and low angles. they even use roy brocksmith from 'total recall' to emphasize the point.--the "choices" motif. i don't know where this started in the genre (maybe 'ghostbusters'), but it's used pretty well here. it even boils down to the 7 games against death--battleship and club.--film self-reference, even present in the game against death (clue). this is smarter than tarantino or brooks. notice the premier magazine cover at the end: "bill and ted: the movie." ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the 'die hard' and 'lethal weapon' sequels.i still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former--particularly in the teen market. carlin is a great comedian, but in these movies he's wasted. also, for all the daring this effort shows, even cracking gay jokes, they can't kill a cat?so, despite looking like a nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. from this movie we got beavis and butt-head. "we're in heaven and we just mugged three people." final analysis = = midrange material

i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store. this one was (i think) just as funny as the first but a much wierder story. it was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death. the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue. the only thing i'd change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great.

it was only on my second viewing, years later, that i realized two things about this movie: 1) i enjoyed it immensely, and 2) that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants. i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests--valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness (even *good*-natured airheadedness) just aren't inherently funny, especially when drawn out to feature length. but though the movie's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end, reeves and winter and sadler (and hal landon jr. in an unforgettable scene) display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily-scripted jokes (e.g. ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) work as effortlessly as the witter ones (e.g. the challenge). and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted (who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie, disaster if they're not well-matched) appears utterly unstrained.(side note: i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining--sightly different comic sensibilities there, it seems.)i give it a 7.75. surprisingly good fun.

i wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original, but it is very good in it's own right. the comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.the story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great. peter hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast. the core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles. i don't care what anyone says, i think keanu reeves is a great actor! i really enjoyed his portrayal of ted in both of these films as i did alex winter's bill. i was very happy to see george carlin returning to the role of rufus, very cool! hal london jr, who plays the part of ted logan's father does a really good job. the scene where ted possesses his fathers body and hal london jr begins acting like ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well. i can't forget to mention william sadler as death, he completely made the movie for me. the rest of the cast is quite good as well.if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series, then i would hope you would like this film as well. but, don't expect it to be as good as the original. i really hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-chris

when i was a kid, i totally loved both bill & ted movies. the other night, bogus journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since i last saw it, i decided to tune in. and i loved it all over again! this film is still funny after all those years. 'excellent adventure' is better, but this one rocks just the same. sure, some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this entire film is cheesy in a cool way. plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie! concluding: totally like non bogus movie dude! way excellent! station!!!

i admit it's very silly, but i've practically memorized the damn thing! it holds a lot of good childhood memories for me (my brother and i saw it opening day) and i have respect for any movie with fnm on the soundtrack.

one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time, bill & ted's bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s. preston esq. and ted theodore logan, aka wyld stallyns. there are two ways to look at this film: first, you see dumb dialogue, far fetched plot, juvenile idea. or.. you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's bill and ted. this is a tricky fence to balance on, but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it becomes so much more.

this movie is very underrated. it's highly imaginative, creative and clever. it's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one. but the film was forgotten when it first came out, and became even more overlooked as the years passed. "bill & ted's bogus journey" also bombed at the box office, whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular. i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late. in 1991, bill and ted already seemed "so '80s". even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time, the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, pearl jam, nirvana, grunge and the seattle sound. bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne, van halen and guns n' roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91, and i think that's one big reason the film bombed at the box office. nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like "excellent!" and "bogus!" in 1991. "gremlins 2" which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s. the transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s. 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, whereas right now, 2002 and last year 2001 still looks/looked like 1995 or 1996.if only "excellent adventure" which was made in 1988, was released that year instead of 1989, and "bogus journey" was made quickly and released in 1989, then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first.

when you start watching this animation-masterpiece, you quickly notice, that it's a european production. although the europeans have (sadly) integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an american production of this kind, most are missing. one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our (very few and very unlikely) heroes can vanquish. another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money, is greedy, runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature. this movie would have been better off without both.the movie is based upon a tv-series that was out four years before the movie. unlike the movie, the tv-series is a cartoon and not a computer animation. at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was quickliy convinced: whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff! although the characters are obviously fictional (in stills they don't even look real), they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest. making characters who by "normal" standards could be considered deformed (those micro-legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump) so alive and lovable is more than "just a highlight"! the creation of the world is another masterpiece. not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it. the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air. when a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground, it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight. in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere. although the world of floating islands is completely surreal, in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesn't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in new york.i wrote that the looks of the world aren't as breathtaking as the idea. as true as that might be to my mind, the quality of the world, the characters and the attention to details is staggering. although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes, emotions can be read as clearly as in sean connery's or dustin hoffman's face. the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike. the background is always in motion, something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive. if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find.the existence of hector actually puts the cherry on top. hector is a furry little "thing" (possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world) who is totally lovable and extremely funny. although he isn't really important for the main plot, he would be missed like scrat would be in ice age. the really cool thing about hector is that you need to speak gibberish to understand him.if the movie is so great, why didn't i give it 10 stars? well, the plot in itself was rather thin. two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world, isn't really original. that in itself wouldn't be much of a problem. what i missed was the background information. what kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way? i love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth.another thing i didn't like was zoé. although a little girl like her could be considered adorable, she was somewhat of a pain in this movie. she seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality, kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down. she would have been ok if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie - or had been less of a girly to start with. to me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers.all in all, this is a really good movie for just about all ages.

the world of the dragon hunters is a 3d gravity challenged world. planetoids, bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen. it is a world reminiscent of neverending story, when the nothing came to eat the world away.funny enough, the villain here is the world gobbler, as well. this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal. they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who, to my chagrin, did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death.the animation is great. the voices and the sounds are top notch. too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine. they go to stop the world gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they defeat him. the end. no real character development or story twists. not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot.bottom line: it's a cute thing to watch, kids would probably enjoy it, but that's about it. no depth to this world (pun intended).

this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series. the series ran briefly on cartoon network, but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going "huh?" this is the story of lian-chu, the kind heart muscle, and gwizdo, the brains of the operation, who along with hector their fire farting dragon,he's more like a dog. travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid. into their lives comes zoe, the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind. it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes. in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. zoe of course tags along...what can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock? this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender. its a beautifully designed, fantastic looking film (the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures) that constantly had me going "wow" at it. the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian-chu (one of the best vocal performances i've ever heard) and rob paulson as gwizdo (think steve bucsemi) is first rate. equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience, using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films (not disney nor pixar). its all really well done.is it perfect? no, some of the bits go on too long, but at the same time its is damn entertaining.if you get the chance see this. its one of the better animated films from 2008, and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009.

dragon hunters has to be the best-looking animated film i've ever seen. it was jaw-dropping. the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash, their weird furry blue dog that pees fire, and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight, and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler, an impossibly immense dragon. but honestly, it doesn't even matter what the film is about. because, it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. the gravity in this fantasy world is different, so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike, and there are forests of floating lily pads. the world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a sort of muted storybook look to it. the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings. the monsters are visually stunning as well, like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats. some of the plot isn't too original, like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world; but the gorgeous graphics, some seriously sinister scenes, and emotion-evoking dialog makes this film spectacular.

what people fail to understand about this movie is that it isn't a beginning, middle, and end, it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long tv series. so remember that when you all talk about how the world wasn't explored enough. that was all done in the tv show.as great and stunning as the visuals are, i think the ***spoilers*** argument between lian-chu and gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie. seeing characters i had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing, and seeing gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while lian-chu sharpened his blade was almost tear-jerking. then we got a total contrast with lian-chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons (which had been featured before in the series) while gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill zoe. *shudder* i'm surprised that this particular scene hasn't been mentioned more in the warnings. any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that gwizdo wasn't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl. it was enough to bother me, and i'm 15.the world is amazing, the plot is a lot better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go. check it out. :)

my 3 year old loved it. i loved it, my wife loved it. so 10 out of 10 from our family. as for violence level? not really that violent, mostly of the slap stick variety. nobody truly dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it certainly is appropriate for children, much more so than many saturday morning cartoons.this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go.first of all beautiful graphics, textures wonderfully done, with true depth, not trying to be realistic, but forming an artistic whole. the moss on the stones, the rust on metal, the reliefs on the wood and the stone, everything adds to the whole.character modeling, unlike many contemporary cg movies, is quirky, not cute, again within an artistic whole. the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies, but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like. i think that is a good thing, it lends veracity, how strangely it may sound, it is easier to suspend your disbelief.hair, fur, clothing, on par, at least with the likes of pixar. just note in the opening scenes when lian-chu is fighting the giant slug; gwizdo is in front of some farmers, and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.the setting. far beyond the likes of cars, and even walle. space has been done many times, but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings, but again it is an artistic whole, and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly. magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc. where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility, or walle where we see the immense trash towers he made, abound in this movie, everything is grand, yet never dwelt upon; it is just the background the whole way! the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls. the chinese wall, the islands floating in the sky. the broccoli in the sky? that is truly where i believe cg should go, make something which takes your breath away, and do it again and again.the sound is good, the music is varied and not only epic, and thankfully without any vocals, and purely original for the movie.animation is quite good. lending its inspiration to cartoons, especially some good use of stretch and squeeze. sometimes not that realistic, but the 3d models are not realistic either.characterization is well done too. lian-chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zoé.gwizdo the wily manager of lian-chu redeems himself in the end, while zoé isn't really changed at all, but who wants that cute child to change anyway? i at least loved lian-chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc.the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures, just as it should in a proper fantasy story.the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story, especially how the world brakes apart. the monsters are pretty standard fare, except the flocking one. it lacks the emotional impact of walle, which is the really strong point of that movie, but it is a much more fun ride, and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one, and has action from the first scene. this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time.the whole movie has, as i've mentioned a whole vision, which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout.it seems, that the setting is ready for more adventures, and i for one would hope so.one side note, the french actor doing lian-chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first, but i'm happy it wasn't him, though he is one of my favorites. nice to hear a new, to me, voice.i give it a max rating, a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some; i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote. approach this movie as an adventure, and as a european movie, not opposed to hollywood, but different.

after watching the trailer i was surprised this movie never made it into theaters, so i ordered the bluray. i had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there. of course, it has its flaws but i can still really recommend it. the animation is well done, very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end. some of the backdrops are just drop-dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it. i thought that forest whitaker's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character lian-chu is depicted in this movie. so overall, thumbs up, i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this. i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget. hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are stitch-like hilarious.

this movie took my breath away at some points, i simply loved it! i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better, but hey, this is just a simple (short) story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon, there's nothing more to it!the overall design, atmosphere, the beautiful landscapes... it's all just magical! they've put a lot of love in this movie. character designs were great and funny. a bit tim burton-ish if you like. i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design, displayed in a simple small, but lovely story.

my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact, making it one thrill ride from start to end. written by frederic lanoir and arthur qwak, the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story, with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around, which can either be wastelands, or globes of greenery.the story's a simple one, which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy, and the resident knights have all but been annihilated. enter the king's granddaughter zoe (marie drion) who gathers lian-chu (vincent lindon), a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant, and his partner-in-arms gwizdo (patrick timsit), who balances the partnership with his cunning brain. lian-chu and gwizdo (together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement, but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free, hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn't exactly pay off.that's basically the whole gist of it, but what makes this film a spectacle, is its cg graphics, which is solidly rich, detailed, and an eye-popping marvel to behold. it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action,, and during those fight sequences, there's nary a boring moment. photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief, and it's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here's having at you george!) and i couldn't get enough of the finale battle as well, though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters.i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of pixar's. and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac: the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple, and let your moving artwork do all the talking. definitely highly recommended!

i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time. the animation is stunning. the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry. i was amazed. moving beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh. character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family.

have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon? oh, you have? was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey? did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon? i didn't think so.i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did! it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. much like the pixar movies, it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world. the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is staggering (the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites). the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action.although the plot may not be entirely unique, the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. our protagonists are likable and interesting, ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path. of course, hector is the character most will fall in love with. a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english, hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of.in summary, i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity. watch it for the incredible animation, the breath-taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen. at the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, i am)!

this is my first review on imdb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) fyi i'm in my late 20s1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. the characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. but the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. the blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic, much as scrat from ice age. the story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds that good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for very young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.8,5 for me

for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature. having healthy respect for pixar, i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this. animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. the graphics is amazing, the background surroundings are mind-blowing, almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly. sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i've seen.the plot is absolutely romantic. as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be. the characters are lovable, especially hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pawns, rocks and rules! the other char-s are very nice also. the humor is top-notch.generally it seemed that creators didn't invest much effort into this. i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar&dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new. and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great. they've made a magnificent, touching movie, a candy for eye and heart.the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10 not 10/10

this is a real eye candy. a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents... who can resist that? an ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero... sounds familiar...? yes we heard that song before. but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery.this movie is fun to watch while it lasts. but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more story.what is behind the 30-years-circle? what drove the knight crazy? who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities... and why are they falling apart? and apart from that one bunch of farmers, where are the people? really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's no lord of the rings.

i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the u.s. to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan. in fact, pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa--the only exception may be the robot. unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds, the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. if it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. the importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. overall, i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny.

the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. my dad actually recorded it off the tv. i must have watched is over 20 times, before the relatively recent release on dvd.i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. in the first version, which i still have on vhs, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. however the new version, featuring van der beek et al, is more comic.to put it another way, it's like watching the original us release of akira with that dub, before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the japanese.i'm in no way complaining, the story and quality of animation are not detracted from, but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film.....

this film is amazing and i would recommend to child and adult alike. the animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is captivating; far better than anything the american studios were producing at the time. however, there is a couple of caveats to this statement. it's a shame that disney bought the studio ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it. my main point being, disney re-dubbed the film, despite the original english version being very impressive. the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e.g. pazu and sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers. the original music score is also far better than the disney remix. it begs the question why did disney make such changes? it seems to me is that by having van der beek et al being cast then disney can draw in more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they tainted they film. it is still a beautiful film and i would still recommend it to anyone. my main beef is that disney ruined a film from childhood which i loved and still love. i am lucky enough to have an original japanese import with the original english dub which i am now going to guard with my life!

saw this on sbs tv here in australia the other week, where it was titled "laputa: castle in the sky". i had enabled subtitles and i think sbs provided their own for that, which, as usual, was of very good quality.just looked up "laputa" on wikipedia and it confirms what i suspected...the floating island of this tale is taken from the classic jonathan swift novel "gulliver's travels", which was published in the early to mid 1700s.anyway, this is an engaging japanese fairytale, which features an english speaking voice-cast. it's suitable for young children, i think, but it does run at just over two hours in length, so it may be too long for some, though not for an adult like me.the story concerns two children who seek to find a legendary floating island which has a castle on it. the children are not the only ones looking for this island. they have pirates, the army and spies looking for the island too, and looking to capture the children (sheeta, the girl, voiced by anna paquin, and pazu, the boy, voiced by james van der beek) in order to help them find it.the graphics are magnificent...sort of photo-realistic at times, especially the scenes of stonework lit by torch-light, or the pretty scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist.recommended.

like many americans, i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw "spirited away." i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki. one of his earlier works is "castle in the sky." although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as "spirited away" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).a young boy named pazu (james van der beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. when she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as sheeta (anna paquin). but sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki. watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. it also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. the voice acting is varied. james van der beek fares best. he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character. anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta. she's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska. he's dangerous and wants something from sheeta, and will do anything to get it. the other voices are bad. cloris leachman is awful as dola. leachman may have won an oscar for "the last picture show," but she's annoying as the pirate leader. leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. it's so bad it nearly ruins the film! jim cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.i would definitely recommend seeing "castle in the sky." i'll probably end up buying it myself. but even though it's not as good as "spirited away," it's still pretty good.

retitled from its original japanese name of laputa (for being an offensive phrase, something which director hayao miyazaki was oblivious to at the time), castle in the sky is the master animator's third film, and it's one of his most beloved of all time. initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release, it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world. inspired by jonathan swift's "gulliver's travels", castle in the sky is a steampunk-themed action adventure tale about two young orphans -- young miner pazu, and mysterious girl sheeta (who wears a magic crystal around her neck) -- who team up to find the long-lost island of laputa, which is rumored to have great riches and gems. they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty dola (who at first chase them, yet turn out to be true allies) and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost-secret agent, muska, who wants the power of laputa for his own benefit.for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours, this film is an excellent choice, featuring just the right amount of humor, exploration, wonder, and mystery to keep one interested. the artwork, although not as spectacular as in some of miyazaki's later movies, is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations, incredibly exciting action scenes, and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy. and while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than miyazaki's other works, each has a memorable, endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over. dola, in particular, makes for a terrific comic character, shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of sheeta the next. muska is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain, but like dola, he commands every scene he's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly.anime fans have often compared this movie to gainax's sci-fi adventure series nadia: the secret of blue water. after all, both works share similar story and character elements... not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself. where both differ is in their execution. nadia, although charming for the most part, suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point, devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot, even though it did have a strong ending. castle in the sky, on the other hand, remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time, and is all the better for it. while the film's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some "cartoonish" moments, like a brawl between pazu's boss and one of dola's sons, it's never to the point that it detracts from the film.about eleven years ago, disney released an english version featuring a cast of big-names such as james van der beek, anna paquin, cloris leachman, mark hamill, mandy patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as tress macneille and jim cummings. it also features an ambitious reworking of joe hisaishi's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra (interestingly, the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself). as much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore, miyazaki had no such problems; in fact, he is said to have applauded the reworking, and for good reason, because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub. while there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring (notably the journey through a dragon-infested storm cloud), the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original, particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end. here, hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals. as far as the performances in the dub go, the leads are probably at the short end of the stick; james van der beek's pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character, while anna paquin's sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times (a problem which actually works in favor of the character). that said, both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout. it's the lively supporting cast, however, that really make this dub so much fun, particularly cloris leachman's dola and mark hamill's muska. both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they're in; as with the rescore, these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub. the script adaptation borders on the loose side at times--there's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary (some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone)--but aside from at least one debatable alteration (sheeta's speech in the climactic showdown "the world cannot live without love" as opposed to the original "you can't survive apart from mother earth"), the overall characters, story, and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original. on the whole, there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece, and i like them both. (they're also better than streamline/jal's more literal but frightfully robotic, lifeless, abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980's; don't believe anybody who says this version is "superior" to disneys--trust me, the opposite is true.) either way, though, you can't go wrong with castle in the sky. it's one of miyazaki's all-time greatest, and i highly recommend it.

the first of the official ghibli films, laputa is most similar to its predecessor nausicaa, but whereas nausicaa was a sf epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak sf premise.for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it. once again you find yourself in awe of miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. the animation, though still not in the league of the later ghibli films, is a little better than in nausicaa.i mentioned in my review of nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'lupinesque' anime style. here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. they provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element i'm not sure. there was nothing funny about nausicaa, and i think it was better off for it. still. having said that, dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female long john silver. don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'treasure planet' at times) and is well voiced by cloris leachman in the american dub.the english voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. however something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. i'll come back to that later.there is so much to admire about laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. it was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.the crucial thing for me was this: i really found that i didn't care much about any of the characters. disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals. that's where laputa falls down as far as i'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. having said that, it must be admitted that miyazaki was leagues ahead of disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'great mouse detective'.laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but i do feel it's over-rated. i definitely prefer the earlier 'nausicaa of the valley of the wind'.btw, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from nausicaa popping up briefly in laputa.

it is an almost ideal romantic anime! must see for all ages! but the english dubbed version is not too good. perhaps the 1999 version will be better.

this is the best dub i've ever heard by disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in kiki delivery service. urrrghhhthis one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. this one has both hero and heroine (although i don't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here, since miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme). as usual, after being introduced by spirited away, amazed by mononoke, troubled by grave of fireflies, and deeply touched by majo no takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part. wondering if this will be the first ghibi's dud. well, in the end just like only yesterday and whisper of the heart, i ended up giving 10 rating. i'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.spoiler somehow i see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. it is as if mankind really can't live with too much power. the collapsing scene gave me patches of metropolis ending. it's just sad somehow. the plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well (as always). joe hisaishi really belongs to uematsu, kanno, williams caliber.people who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.this is a feel good movie that used to be part of us cinema in the classic days (it's a wonderful life etc etc). well, things change....

i just realised i've been using imdb for years now and i've never reviewed my favourite film. by favourite i don't mean something i like for now, i mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it. this is obvious because i am never going to be a child again; i saw this film on itv in the early nineties. i was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at, i'm also male, the gender that this film is intended for (the overwhelming majority of miyazaki's protagonists are female). consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and i am forever indebted to carl macek (sp?) for producing the english dub of this film which is far superior to the di$ney production which is not even funny - i've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the macek version is so good (the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original japanese actors) that this version is available on the japanese dvd! it's not available on any distribution in an english-speaking country. go figure.there are hundreds of competent reviews so i'm going to put some trivia here, not that i'm the definitive archive of information for this film.first up i'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review miyazaki's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on imdb combined pale into insignificance.the fascinating story with this film is that miyazaki based the countryside around slag's ravine (pazu's town area) on the welsh mining communities. he visited wales for a few months in the early 80s (might be late 70s) just after one of the great mining strikes. being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight. the fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. the countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where i grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest british isles.the island is of course from swift's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in swift's book is, deliberately, ridiculous. in castle in the sky, miyazaki weaves together myths such as atlantis and the tower of babel - i think the architecture in addition is based on peruvian ruins though i'm not sure, someone told me that.anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film really will want to check out miyazaki's epic series mirai shounen conan - future boy conan - based on the short sci fi novel 'the incredible tide' by alexander key (novel is available online). conan is basically a prototype for laputa's pazu and shita. in addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for masterpiece theatre - some of his key frame animation. he also did key frame for sherlock hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds i've ever seen too. also check out miyazaki and takahata's first feature film horus prince of the sun (1968) - amazing by today's standards in fact. what else... gauche the cellist and the flying ghost ship - though they're pretty rare.this film is such a gift, i don't know what we'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around, this is like an oasis. arigatou miyazaki-sensei!

castle in the sky is undoubtedly a hayao miyazaki film. after seeing it for the first time i'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. on the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! produced early in his cinematic career, castle in the sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. and, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, flying machines (lots of it!!), beautiful painted sceneries  but alas, no pigs ( at least that i've noticed, after all i have only seen it once). never the less, miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with nausicãa, which was a dress rehearsal for princess mononoke, his magnum opus. castle in the sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his tv series conan, and his directed episodes of meitantei holmes. in here we are introduced to sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of laputa, pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. as the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing myiazaki at his best. the sound track is very reminiscent of spirited away, (or vice versa, as castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, joe hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward! a note to the english dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although anna paquin's sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for mark hamil as muska, making up for a delighting yet devilish villain! don't miss this one people!

i never met a single person (out of hundreds) who hated this movie. bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur, or a victim of one. this film has everything. ask yourself, "are you a fan of. . . ?" then go see "laputa".it's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is directed by the same person (hayao miyazaki). in any case, this one ranks among my top five. and i've seen a lot of movies.

i've seen the original english version on video. disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. i can't believe i'm saying that. the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own. the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film. the animation quality is excellent! if you've seen disney's job of kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production. it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion. (but not quite!) finally miyazaki's films are being released properly! i can't wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa!

lapyuta (castle in the sky), more than any of hayao miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical. it's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it's here check it out! and stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever.)i give it a ten/ten.

hayao miyazaki's second feature film, and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically (though his debut - nausicaa aka warriors of the wind is considered by many fans his best), 'tenku no shiro rapyuta' aka 'castle in the sky' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like 'kiki's delivery service', 'mononoke-hime' and 'spirited away', but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime. it's important to remember that 'castle in the sky' was made two years before the revolutionary 'akira', and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece, the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters, and the story is quite predictable and obvious (at least in today's standards), miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before. while the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times, the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as 'spirited away'. and if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low-budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of japanese cartooning - you'll see miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on 'spirited away' and mononoke. while 'castle in the sky', being a sci-fi adventure and very suitable for children, fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since, his motifs and principles still show and play an important part. to say much more would be to ruin the movie, so i'll kindly shut up. suffice to say that i'm giving it only nine stars because if i gave it ten i couldn't go any higher for 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke'. and that would be a crime.as in most anime movies, i recommend watching the japanese version with the english subtitles, even if you don't speak a word of japanese - the english overdubs just don't tend to be very good, and in this case it's just horrendous. you might want to watch it in the english version once, though, just for the laughs, and for the star-filled cast (the english dub was only recorded following the success of 'spirited away', as it was for 'kiki's delivery service') - anna paquin and james van der beek (yeah, the dawson guy!) fill the lead roles, mark hamill (luke skywalker from 'star wars', in case you don't know!) plays the villain, and other roles are filled by andy dick, tres macneille (the simpsons, rugrats, animaniacs...), michael mcshane (friar tuck from kevin costner's robin hood travesty) and mandy patinkin (hello, my name is inigo montoya...) good for a laugh, or a few laughs really. but watch the japanese one first.

breathtaking, this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression. years went by and i forgot the title of the film, and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again. after reading other peoples reviews and analysis i'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must see for all children and adults. its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind. if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it. there's not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy.

listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this). i've seen it twice thus far, and i should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice.i've seen all miyazaki & studio ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (mononoke). at least, compared to for example the other ghibli master takahata (grave of the fireflies / only yesterday / raccoon wars). but not this one.in laputa, miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example totoro. every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. the pacing is so perfect that i know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being. the story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it.it is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist.despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece. if you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that hayao miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. this of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact. if you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same.

i know anime. i've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon; i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was. and just so you know i'm not bragging about my, let me say this: out of all the animes i've seen, castle in the sky is by far one of the best. it's obvious people say spirited away is the best, but i really disagree. most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award; this isn't an exaggeration - i've shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people who'd only ever seen spirited away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three. personally, i'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke, until i finally saw castle in the sky. i still think that the prior is the better of the two, but castle in the sky is easily on par with it; in many ways, castle has major elements that mononoke was missing. in either case, if you've only seen spirited away, and think that that is miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken.

i first saw this film when i was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy i was in no way disappointed by what i saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone. but this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike. with a floating island, a mad general, a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down i would recommend this film to any one.

hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts. who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138? i remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation. so when i found a copy in a well known store for £9 i couldn't resist but buy it. the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way).viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean 'moebius' giraud some of the artwork is. i can only assume some influence here.when pazu catches a falling girl (sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for laputa - a reference to jonathan swift's overlooked portion of gulliver's travels. with healthy references to jules verne it's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa.this is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree. this is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground.although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals. the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same.it is incredibly stylish, i would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything.myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime. buy this movie and treasure it.

have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own, with one of your closest friends at your side, facing all sorts of dangers and villains, and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets? even if you're not quite that much of a fantasy-lover, have you ever wished you could simply experience what it's like to be a kid again, and not have a care in the world, for just a couple of hours? this is exactly what miyazaki's "castle in the sky" is all about. pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day, a girl named sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds, while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail. simply put, it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another, and i can't help but feel my worries melt away every time i see it.as it is one of miyazaki's older works and takes much place in the everyday world, the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as spirited away, howl's moving castle, or even princess mononoke. still, i find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other, because all three of those films are, at some point or another, mystical to the point of being enigmatic, if not perplexing, especially for the youngest of viewers."castle in the sky", on the other hand, doesn't try so much to be an allegory of any kind, and it's not a coming-of-age story either; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child's mind i've ever seen. not only is the artwork beautiful, but the use of perspective from the kids' eyes is just amazing; whether it's the panning up of the "camera" to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead, or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air, i just can't help but feel like i'm there with pazu and sheeta, just a kid in another world, far far away from reality.even the kids themselves don't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like ashitaka/san or chihiro/haku; sheeta is pazu's angel, having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day, the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start. as the film progresses, more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions. not only are they an adorable reminder of who i used to be, but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film, only growing stronger all the way to the last frame. for that reason, i've fallen in love with the two of them more than i have with any other miyazaki couple.at the same time, "castle in the sky" is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be, you'll be sure to find your fix here. mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, even some western...it's all here, just about everything people go to the movies for (except maybe horror). this why i can easily recommend it as a first miyazaki film; it's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.even the ending song of the film, when translated into english, conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization, and some kind of soul-mate, that could not be found in our mundane lives. "the reason i long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them...the earth spins, carrying you, carrying us both who'll surely meet." miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of joe hiasashi's gorgeous scores, but this is the only one i've seen that's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream. i have found myself near tears just listening to it."castle in the sky" may not be miyazaki's most developed, spectacular, or meaningful work, but it's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be: a true vision of childhood fantasy, and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids. sit back, relax, and love it for what it is.

it's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being 'the best,' whether of all time, a certain genre, or what have you, but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact, laputa is the greatest animated film ever made. it is in my mind the masterwork of hayao miyazaki, the most talented of japan's animated directors, and it best captures his strengths as a director, storyteller, and designer, as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes. the version i'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub (i know, sacrilege for a hard-core anime fan to not watch it in its native language); there is at least one other english language dub out there, i have it on vhs (i have no idea from what source), and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film. but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.laputa tells the story of a boy named pazu (voiced by james van der beek here), who's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named sheeta (anna paquin) literally drops from the sky. it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent, colonel muska (mark hamill), who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck. to keep things lively, there's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal, led by the aging but still boisterous dola (cloris leachman). the plot revolves around the crystal's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of laputa, a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure. it's all very much in keeping with a fairy-tale setting, but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story, and the plot is peppered with 'gosh-wow' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.the design work on laputa, nearly twenty years later, is still revolutionary. flying machines of all sorts abound, utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking. the world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century, with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines. but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution; laputa is both the garden of eden and the fire of heaven itself, and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal, its power, and its danger.besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film, laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography. from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one-man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water, laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of cgi  can only daydream about. though we only see a small fraction of this world, its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it. the film also contains one of my favorite, if not the most exciting, action sequences ever: a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in, all the while trying to protect sheeta (who was the one who woke it up). meanwhile, pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her, literally, from the jaws of destruction. from the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last-second rescue, the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.it helps that laputa has an amazing score. composer joe hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world, the dewy innocence, the exciting action, and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians. though he re-recorded it for this dvd release (which imo is not an improvement over his original score), adding pieces here and there, the score matches the visuals perfectly, a rare total union of sound and vision.this isn't a bad dub. i'm inordinately fond of the older english dub, and this one over-explains things just a tad in spots, but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those (and those matched the japanese pretty well). dola in particular is hard to get right, but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman (her sons aren't quite as good as the original). paquin does a good job as sheeta, and mark hamill, while i knew it was him early, is more than talented enough to do muska (i liked the other english dub of muska a little more, but hamill's good). much of the film rests on pazu's shoulders, and van der beek is wonderful. listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub, because vdb matches up very closely with the original pazu. although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful, as much as i love this film, i don't think you're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular anglicized version. john lassiter of pixar introduces it up front, and my suspicion is that he, like so many others, simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and mononoke (one of his few films i didn't care for), but to me laputa is still his crowning achievement. anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work, and again, this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder. i'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen; while that will probably never happen, it's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on dvd.

laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! the plot is classic miyazaki. i won't give it away, but the end is really great. i rank this as one of miyazaki's three best with nausicaa and spirited away. also you may want to check out howl's moving castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa. enjoy, piper a

by now you've probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki's classic film, laputa: castle in the sky. during late summer of 1998, disney released "kiki's delivery service" on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in "1999". it's obviously way past that year now, but the dub has been finally completed. and it's not "laputa: castle in the sky", just "castle in the sky" for the dub, since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish (even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub). you've also probably heard that world renowned composer, joe hisaishi, who scored the movie originally, went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements. laputa came out before my neighbor totoro and after nausicaa of the valley of the wind, which began studio ghibli and it's long string of hits. and in my opinion, i think it's one of miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem. laputa: castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it.for those unfamiliar with castle in the sky's story, it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours. the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted, you see miyazaki's true vision. and believe me, it's one fantastic one. the film begins with sheeta, a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship. sheeta holds the key to laputa, the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization. the key to laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many, namely the government, the military and the air pirate group, the dola gang (who sheeta and pazu later befriend). soon, the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid. she falls a few thousand feet, but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant. as she floats down from the sky, pazu, an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines, sees sheeta and catches her. the two become fast friends, but thanks to her pendant, the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the dola gang and government try to capture sheeta. one action sequence after another, we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue. plus somewhat twisty surprise. i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time. the story is wonderful, as we peak into hayao miyazaki's animation which has no limits. the setting of the film is a combo of many time periods. it does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s, but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons. laputa is also surprisingly a funny film. the film has tons of hilarious moments, almost equal to the drama and action the film holds. i think the funniest part is a fight scene where pazu's boss faces off against a pirate, and soon after a riot breaks out. it's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.now let's talk about how the dub rates. an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life. teen heartthrob james van der beek plays the hero pazu, who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version, where in the original he sounded more childlike. either way, i think his voice is a nice fit with pazu. anna paquin, the young oscar winner from "the piano", plays sheeta. this is also a nice performance, but the voice is a bit uneven, she doesn't stay true to one accent. at times she sounds as american as apple pie, but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand. the performance i most enjoyed however was of coris leachman, who played mama dola. not only is this an excellent performance, but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life. if there was ever a live action laputa movie (g-d forbid), she would be the one to play her, you can just imagine her in the role (well, somewhat). luke skywalker himself, mark hamill is muska, and this is another top rate hamill performance. you may be familiar with hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies, but he renders muska to full evil. his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker, who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series. rounding out the cast is voice character actor jim cummings, who does a great, gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy patakin as members of the dola gang.now let me talk about what really makes this dub special, joe hisaishi's newly arranged music! for those who have never heard of him, mr. hisaishi does the music and like all of miyazaki's films, the music is very memorable. each of his scores has it's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly. now, these new arrangements he has done are more "american like", which i think was the goal of the new recordings. don't worry, the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form. the score, to me, sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster. it has more power, it has more emphasis, it's clearer and deeper. the film's prologue, the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships, has some new music (i am not sure, but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all). but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy. things seem very enhanced. in a powerful scene, the music is more stronger then in the original versions. in a calm scene, it's more calmer. overall, i think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes, i highly did myself, and personally think it helps improve the film. i prefer the new score over the old one, and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful, and much of the original japanese lines are intact. in kiki, i'm sure a few lines where changed, and this is the same way, lines have been changed. but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written. i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered, but they were there intact. some new lines have been added as well which help out. but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing, disney did not translate the ending song, it was in japanese. i was mortified when they did completely new songs for the kiki dub, but with this version it's the original song... in japanese. so i guess it's good it's still the original, but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english.there is a big down side to this dub, and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips. of course in any dub it won't be perfect, but i think in kiki and mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed (and disney had a little bit more time with this one...). some of the time everything matches perfect, some of the time it doesn't completley match, and in a rare case, someone says something and the lips don't move at all (there's a scene where sheeta chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit).as far as things about the film itself, these are my thoughts. i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation. from the opening sequence to the ending, the animation is so lush and detailed, you just have to watch in awe. you see the true nature of each character, true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action. you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film. everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn, it's like a moving piece of art. and to think, this was done in the mid 1980's. the animation is quite different from disney, ghibli has it's own distinctive flare which is very different, but very good. and after all these years, the colors look as vibrant as ever. laputa also has tons of action sequences, lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground. these sequences are so well done and so intriguing, it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film. and the finale is just something you must see. the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions, guns firing and everything else well. and like all miyazaki films, each one focuses on a different theme (i.g. kiki: confidence). this one has a great a lesson on greed and power. people don't realize how greed can take over you, and how having too much power isn't good. people are obsessed with power, and are greedy, and the main villian, muska, greatly shows this.all in all, laputa: castle in the sky was a great film to begin with, and is now improved for the most part. i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory. with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from joe hisaishi, disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy. though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the kiki and princess mononoke disney dubs, castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film.

i first saw this back in the early 90s on uk tv, i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it, many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again, the main thing that stuck with me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, its easy to watch, has a great story, great music, the list goes on and on, its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it, yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch, it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty, i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top 10 films of all time. buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film.enjoy

this is one of my all time favorite movies, period. i can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does. this flick has it all: action, adventure, science fiction, good vs. bad and even some romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between the pazu and sheeta). maybe best of all, you don't have to be in mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of miyazaki's other movies (i don't know about you, but i watch movies to take a break from thinking). this is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. the only sour note is the american dubbing. i found vander-geek to be just plain annoying. but all is not lost, the original japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! who cares if you can't understand spoken japanese? if you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original japanese recording with english subtitles. you won't regret it.

i first saw this film when i was about 8 years old on tv in the uk (where it was called "laupta: the flying island"). i absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it. i was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "streamline dub" (the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney. the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dub or the original japanese had, and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead. they have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from "pazu" to "patzu", and added some dialogue. but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which i find annoying in many disney films.this film still blows away most recent animated films, and i cannot recommend it highly enough. the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.

this is one of the best animated family films of all time. moreover, virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of hiyao miyazaki and his studio ghibli. specifically, other great films include "my neighbor totoro" and "kikki's delivery service." spirited away is quite good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult. the one thing that sets "laputa: castle in the sky" apart from other films by miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride.why is this film so good? because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling.most japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized, and juvenile. none of these problems plague castle in the sky. it has imagination to burn, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (none of those trench-coat wearing posers) there is plenty of adventure, but not blood and gore. the animation is smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots. the backgrounds are wonderful.the voice acting in the dubbed english version is first rate, particularly the two leads, pazo (james van der beek) and sheeta (anna paquin). the sound engineering is great, too. use your studio sound, if you've got it.one aspect that i particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained. laputa was once inhabited, and is now abandoned. why? we never know. we know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters, who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters (e.g., gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60!

i have seen just about all of miyazaki's films, and they are all beautiful and captivating. but this one rises above the rest. this movie totally impressed me!i fell in love with pazu and sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. they were what made the movie for me. of course, the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. but the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality.now, let me clarify: i'm really talking about the japanese version of the movie (with english subs). while the english dub is good (mostly), it simply pales in comparison to the original language version. the voices are better, the dialogue, everything. so i suggest seeing (and hearing) the movie the way it originally was.

hayao miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to walt disney. that is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. he really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and laputa is indeed one awesome ride.but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me. laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination. ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true. every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself. not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi! everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.

i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero's every week.you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure.oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies.so any ole way i believe i've got what i wanna say.would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,if this is so then i must go so lets do it.

the freedom of having your own sea going power boat, the excitement of going on underwater adventures a rugged,an's man of an adventurer and lovely(and so well endowed!) assistants in fine bikinis were all definite selling points for "sea hunt"(1958-61).just what was the reason for producing a sort of sea going "gun for hire"* series. let's look closely now. there must be a some clues around.if we were to look back just a little, we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater! (1955). it starred jane russell, gilbert roland, richard egan and lori nelson as a quartet of very attractive scuba diving adventurers working on salvage in the carribbean, including a pre-fidel cuba. the film was moderately successful and was memorable not necessarily for its story as for the looks of the principals in swimming suits. fine, shapely women folk in some really keen 2 piece bathing suits (woo, woo, woo, woo!) are always a plus for the guys; and the presence of rugged, athletic men folk displaying their best beefcake "poses" is equally pleasing to the gals.and there is one element that is a true legacy of this old rko feature. it is on the soundtrack contained in between the musical queues and themes. it is the recording of "it's cherry pink and apple blossom white", written by louiguy and jacques larue and performed by damaso perez prado and his orchestra.anyone who hears this insturmental or song (with lyrics)will not soon forget it. its carribbean beat is so very lively and its rich use of the brass section of the orchestra is powerful and instantly renders instant impression and memory. the 45 rpm record of this song made it to the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many saturday evenings on nbc tv's "your hit parade". we can't remember just how many weeks nor just how high it got. (maybe some one can fill us in on that one item, please!) so, we got back to "sea hunt" and its own odyssey in getting on "the tube". the public had taken to underwater! all right, but would they go for a tv series.ziv tv productions was getting a reputation for putting out a type of product that, for the most part, didn't get signed on by the networks for the multi-station hook-up treatment. but they had been having some great successes with television syndication.** by that we mean, offering a series for stations for showings on a one to a tv station per each market area. (much like the various newspaper syndicates "sell" comic strips to various papers around the country, and world, even.so, we got 'mike nelson', himself, in the physical presence of lloyd bridges. mr. bridges had been around for approximately 15 years or so and had turned in some very memorable performances in mostly supporting and highly varying roles in a couple of boston blackie movies (with chester morris)to they stooge to conga (3 stooges 1943), sahara (also 1943), home of the brave (1949) and the whistle at eaton falls(1951).lloyd brought a very convincing manner to his characterization, along with a fine, convincingly athletic physique, having the look of a guy who makes his living with his physical abilities. he took very well as the diver's diver, whether it's performing duties on board ship, or fathoms beneath the sea.and lloyd did take to the role quickly, but contrary to a lot of misinformation out there, he was not familiar with s.c.u.b.a.*** prior to landing this mike nelson gig. but the athletic mr. bridges proved to be a quick learner, as so many of the close-up shots underwater revealed that there was no doubt about it, that it was lloyd with the mask, the bubbler(air tank) and the flipper fins.stories almost always involved the helping-out some client for pay, much like a private detective would. so what if the client was a lovely lady who looked good in the bathing suit, all the better.like so many of the other ziv/united artists tv productions,"sea hunt" possessed a fine, haunting opening theme and closing, along with some original incidental music and queues.at one time, i believe that "sea hunt" was the top syndicated tv series, a success that ziv series had known before with the likes of "science fiction theatre"and "highway patrol". as far as the showing venue for this underwater saga, here in chicago it was shown late night (after 10:30 p.m.) on wnbq tv, channel 5 (our nbc affiliate, now known as wmaq tv).and i can remember just who was the original sponsor in this particular market was. and there were even on scene commercials done by the star! how well we can remember and visualize lloyd as mike nelson, riding on his power boat. and as we were being invited to return the next week and watch ".....another adventure of "sea hunt", sponsored by the g. heileman brewing company of lacrosse, wisconsin' the makers of old style lager beer!", all while mike was toasting us, raising an old style bottle. (shame on you, mike! drinking beer on your moving boat! we're tellin' the coast guard!) then, the boat would leave the dock, accompanied by the sea hunt theme and rolling the credits.note: * more figuratively than literal, mike was for hire and things ran very much like a deterctive story.note: ** ziv's syndicated successes included "science fiction theatre", "west point"(and its clone "men of annapolis"), "sea hunt" and "highway patrol".note*** and of course, scuba is a acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus.

lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series. what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater. the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious.the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro, mike nelson. there were excellent shows, and the program always appeared to be well produced. granted, the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds it's own with any other show produced during this era, the infancy of american television.

i loved watching ''sea hunt '' back in the day , i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch ''sea hunt '' and mike nelson in his underwater adventures .i loved it ! he took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . pre ''thunderball '' or even before cousteau became common , there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids .i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show . watch and enjoy !!!

what a night. perry mason then have gun, will travel followed by gunsmoke (when it was a half hour) and finally at 10:30pm came 'sea hunt' with its wonderful opening theme music and mike's boat sailing off to a new adventure. terrific.. regardless of the story it was the lead character (played by lloyd bridges), strong, honest, sincere. a man's man and a boy's man. this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years. why they don't show on cable or make it available on video, no idea.. too bad.

this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network. i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet. this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie, though i would rather watch the original japanese version. americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed. this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot. he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun. during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother, a beautiful woman named matel, who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero, or really bad. he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series, so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe. all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending. there would be a sequel to this one, but it was not quite as good as this one, however the ending was a bit more final than it was here.

what can i say ? an action and allegorical tale which has just about everything. basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world ..... and more. he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains, and has quite a time telling them apart. a definite must-see.

anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. this is a fine movie that tells about tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grows up in the process. the journey on the train sort of represents tetsuro's journey from boyhood to manhood. the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can tell it's a 70's movie) and the animation is only slightly better than your average "star blazers" episode. but the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn't matter. a must-see for any animation fan!

one word can describe this movie and that is weird. i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting. well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.

galaxy express 999 (ginga tetsudô three-nine). made in 1979. directed by rintaro. based on the original work by leiji matsumoto.what little i know of the history of galaxy express 999, it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by leiji matsumoto. ge999 is set in the same star wars-type of space universe as matsumoto's other famous space manga: captain harlock. in fact space pirate harlock and other characters from that manga (including queen emeraldas and tochirô oyama) make appearances in ge999. ge999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes. it was aired in 1978. a year later came this anime film, which isn't a sequel to the series, but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie. the story is set in unidentified star wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility. people of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years, maybe even forever. the protagonist, tetsurô hoshino, is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel count mecha, whose entire body is made of mechanical parts, kills tetsurô's mother. tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body. to obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train galaxy express 999. however, since tetsurô comes from poverty, he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket. by a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman, maetel, who bears a resemblance to his dead mother. maetel offers a ticket for tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey. and so the journey beginsi first saw this film last october, about six months from now, and again yesterday. i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed. then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? whatever the case, the situations change with a fast speed and tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance. i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes. however, there's no arguing that ge999 has deserved its place as an anime classic. the animation itself, very faithful to the style of matsumoto's manga, is detailed and beautiful to watch. even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become "out of date" but puts many later anime films in shame. the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat "old" these day (it was the 70's after all). i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good. voice actors give life to their characters, most memorable ones being masako nozawa (mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga) as the excited and young tetsurô, and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel. the supporting characters are not left in shadows, but also have a life of their own, most memorable to me being waitress claire. the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours, as well as for those who try to find deeper messages. ge999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood. the whole film is told from his point of view, so we are forced to feel what he feels. i think many people can relate to tetsurô, for despite the fantasy elements, he is a very realistic character: young, hot headed, awkward and naive. we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not. maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end, when she reveals who and what she really is, it doesn't much answer to anything. maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man, always close but just out of reach. it's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsurô and maetel that still awakes talking and questions, and fascinates after the decades. people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends, of mother and son, or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since maetel's age is unknown and tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet). without any means to sound deep, i think the best term to describe them is "soul mates". there is no question that the two feel devotion, caring and love for each others, yet it goes beyond that of friendship, family and lovers. i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories, it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters. the ending scene, even if you already know what is going to happen, is still very touching and memorable.all in all, despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes, galaxy express 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomo's akira (1988) and mamoru oshii's ghost in the shell (1995). the film is directed by rintaro, who had previous experience of leiji matsumoto's works as he had worked in captain harlock series. later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines. galaxy express 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan.

yeah, it is. in fact, it's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies. number 15, i think. anyways, i'm usually not one for plots, but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games, (final fantasy 7, for example) and not movies. but this one has it all. vivid drawings of planets, stars, an extremely well written screenplay. while this is not really for children, they can still watch it, it contains no graphic blood, guts and silicone. but i don't think they're going to understand it.

i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say, galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time. if you've never understood the appeal of anime, discovering this film may be your golden ticket to otaku-town.the story is as delicate and poetic as ridley scott's blade runner. the cell animation, while somewhat traditional, possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual storytelling.this is one of those unique children's films like star wars, the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own terms.i highly recommend this film.

those childhood memories...when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.one of the initial memories i have from childhood is this animated program "galaxy express 999," about a young boy named tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the galaxy, in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-hearted, trophy gathering mechanical hunters. accompanying tetsuro on his journey is maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago...back in the early-80's, as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in seoul, south korea, "galaxy express 999" was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them. the memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time...those were some wonderful memories, never to be had again...as i moved to america, and while residing here for over 2 decades, i sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from america by an enormously vast ocean, of this childhood program, with its hit theme song, and of the boy named tetsuro, his protective companion maetel, the enigmatic train conductor, and of the spacefaring train galaxy express 999.many, many years passed...last summer while i was in korea, i was able to track down a copy of the original "galaxy express 999" (1979) on dvd, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. "galaxy express 999" remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life's journey into manhood.here's to wonderful memories. "good-bye, maetel. good-bye, galaxy express 999...good-bye, to my childhood."10/10

attention, spoiler!many people told me that «planet of the apes» was tim burton's worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film. so i decided not to see it. another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a tim-burton-movie is still a tim-burton-movie'. i decided to do it, and i found that he was right.it's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `planet of the apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. still, tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `beetlejuice' or `batman'. if you are already fond of burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.what the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: what's the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake? first of all, burton wouldn't be burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. on the other hand, burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. concerning the story-line, burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with  and here is the spoiler  leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `planet of the apes'. an ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because  and here i'm disagreeing with various `planet of the apes'-homepages and -platforms  it does not make any sense. there cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. tim burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. well, and i don't think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again

....after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me!!!! whatever happened to the old burton who read "the dark knight returns" by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988-89? by the looks of it burton didn't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong! this movie sucks! it's not as good as the original and it doesn't deal with the same subject as the original. if you want a good ape movie watch the original.**out of****stars

take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. it's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn thriller. visually, it's incredible. everything else was just ok. for what it is, i think the movie is awesome, but i like everything burton has done. people need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b/c of this movie. it wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it's not. the ending was cool. . i took it as a parallel universe.

charleton heston wore one, james franciscus wore one but mark wahlberg opts not to don the traditional loin cloth. i hope no one casts him as tarzan. linda harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 planet movies but estrella warren barely shows cleavage - her hair is always in the way. tim burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. even the chaste helena bonham carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. she's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. as in artificial intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - planet of the apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. lisa marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. this movie has three great actors tim roth, ms. carter & paul giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. superlative make up (a certain oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.

i'm not sure if it is available worldwide - but if anyone who's deciding what is supposed to be put on videotapes and distributed in video clubs - is reading this - please , please buy it! (if i wasn't clear: get the movie into videostores!)can't be explained - must see!

along with the "maratonci trce pocasni krug" from the same director, one of the masterpieces of ex-yugoslavia comedies. if you want to understand serbian mentality, you must see this movie. and if you want to see several of ex-yugoslav great actors at the same time, this is a opportunity.

ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times. believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it. but truth is that the humour in this comedy is special.it is caratherisic for serbia. and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well!!! so i think the rest of audience (for example: in europe)can't enjoy it so much. because the subtitles ruin the hole thing. but they should at least try!!!! yes it is ironic! this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it! :-) if you have got a chance to see this one, don't blew up ok!

this is the best movie i have ever seen.i've seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988 (?).that month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday night.the next week there was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name of which i don't remember. if you know it, please let me know! in any case, how can i get to see this movie again???? a dvd of this movie, where?? please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nlthe next week there was another great movie (involving a train, rather than a bus) the name of which i don't remember. if you know it, please let me know! in any case, how can i get to see this movie again???? a dvd of this movie, where?? please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl

this is what i call a great movie. it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital belgrad. the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together. watch it and you gonna remember it for life... its filled with slavic humor and lifestyle.and another reason for its magic : it is hard to get!!

i watched this film over a hundred times. it is really best serbian movie made ever.i wood like to recommend this movie to everyone. it is very good comedy. i surely like it!!!!

i like this movie a lot, but it's a fact, that you cannot understand it, unless you're from the ex yugoslavia. most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia. i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection. macedonia. serbia. montenegro. bosnia and herzegowina. croatia. slovenia.all of this was ex yugoslavia, a melting pot of the balcan nations. it could be a dream land, if slobodan milosevic, franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldn't poison the nation's mind with their sick ideas.

actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university. but nobody in usa has heard of it, which is a real shame! the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad. they are stuck together on a long bus trip--someplace most of us have been!! but i never had one like this!! my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral. then the man & woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing! just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way--the consumptive starts hacking & they realize everybody is watching!! talk about surprised! but...you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny! when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did! serb humor at it's best!

at first sight, who's singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy with only a kind of unusual, quiet and slow motion : what a mistake ! beginning with two singers on a desert landscape, then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors, it hides a gem !the folded story, and a false rhythm induces you to think, yes it is comic, but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie. not at all : very funny by instant, dark subtle cynical on others, its development surprises you all along the story very ingeniously and cleverly presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them full life.and what is astonishing, it's based on deep observation, great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings, and really everything, the general direction and how also the details are presented, that it simply makes you forget it's a movie: it is like to watch a kind human society, you yet don't know,shot by a friend behind a camera.and you're the one behind him. it is simple, and simply exceptional !don't misunderstand me; in no way that would means the script , the quality of picture, the music score have a kind of amateurish way, no, no ! it's great art ! because it flows like a river from high up in the mountain, down to the sea, with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea from a tiny thing to a main stream.this metaphoric image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has who's singing over there. for me, again, i take the hammer : simply exceptional...i've seen that the director is the one who made chat blanc/chat noir, which i know is quiet famous but as i yet didn't see it, i had no idea about this gentleman.others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film, i fully agree !european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated, but i am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language, with good english subtitles. all in all : deep, delicious and exceptional...for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs, avoid it at any cost, it may be too subtle and good for you !but if you're interested in different genres and/or classics, i guess you won't regret this one, and in case of buying, it will have good companionship in your personal dvd library, with such no less than merited big names like billy wilder, lubitsch, or sacha guitry among some of my preferred directors . at least for this movie !***a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles***

"ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films i ever saw. a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god-forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii. i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and i had no chance to come across it ever since. it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.

this is the movie i've seen more times than any other (i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released). and every time i see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography. this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. in the same league: maratonci trce pocasni krug, balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu. this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection.

years ago i was lucky enough to have seen this gem at a >gypsy film festival in santa monica. you know the ending >is not going to be rosie and tragedy will strike but it's >really about the journey and characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into what was "yugoslavia". >while i am not yugonostalgic and tend to shy away from >the current crop of "yugoslavian" films (give me ademir >kenovic over late 90s kustarica) i'd be happy to have the >chance to stumble on this film again, as it shines in my >celluloid memories. ever since seeing who's singing over >there" 15 years ago i still hear the theme tune, sung by >the gypsies, ruminating through my head "i am miserable, >i was born that way" with the accompanying jew's harp and accordian making the tune both funny and sad. the late, great actor pavle vujisic (muzamer from when father >was away on business) was memorable as the bus driver of >the ill-fated trip in his typical gruff yet loveable manner. hi

the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes. the man who "steals the show" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. in the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country.

one of my favourite "domestic" movies. i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie! it's funny, and sad at some moments...i don't know how did people around the world (who had opportunity to watch it) accept this movie, because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century, to be able to understand it! but as i see here, there is somebody from canada who watched it...and he liked it.i think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site, but first to find out how to do that...cheers.

superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit, absurdness and serbian mentality. movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. best point in a film: characters, then humor itself, story and dialogs. humor has 'inner development' , rare in serbian movies. so, it is consequence of characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and cogent. also it is sharp, intelligent and lucid. most of the movies, unfortunately, had constructed humor (devise a joke and put it into a characters's mouth) or ordinary situation comedy, burlesque, farce. some of the 'art immortality' are incorporated in this movie. little masterpiece, hardly reachable.

a milestone in eastern european film making and an outstanding example of serbian mentality. a group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord. with "maratonci trce pocasni krug" makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word.

this movie is one of the funniest, saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the balkans yet again, 45 years after the time depicted. all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger, sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response. the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types, however, make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-yugoslavia to its madness. in fact, no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie, and its twin, *maratonci trce pocasni krug.* did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen?

this "tragicomedy" written by famous serbian theatre/film writer dusan kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. and yet, its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. a masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed).in an aged bus en route to capital belgrade, a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour. two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with stanojlo milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real-life performance).the spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into nation's collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. using a simple movie language, director slobodan sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (world war i), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the great war veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a german spy.brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "maratonci trce pocasni krug", "kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota", and my other director's favourite "davitelj protiv davitelja").

i saw this film (it's english title is "who's singing over there?") at the 1980 montreal international film festival. it won raves then... and disappeared. a terrible shame. it is brilliant. sublime, ridiculous, sad, and extremely funny. the script is a work of art. it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.

i had never heard of robert roy macgregor before "rob roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. playing the title character, liam neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to oskar schindler, and jessica lange also does a really good job as his wife mary. archibald cunningham (tim roth) is one person very likely to make your skin crawl.all in all, this comes out as good as "braveheart" (maybe even better). i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back-to-back taking a swipe at england. very good. also starring john hurt, eric stoltz, brian cox and jason flemyng.

i first saw rob roy twelve years ago. with little money for entertainment, i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter's night. the movie i had wanted was gone, so i rented this instead, not expecting much, and was very much surprised with how good it was. i just recently watched it again, and loved it every bit as much as the first time. for those unfamiliar with the story, it's about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor, a cattleman and folk hero. from the little i know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it's a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused. basically, the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from. but, his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest. our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis, and mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham, a smarmy englishman with no soul. atrocities ensue, until, in an immensely satisfying conclusion, rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey. there are many great performances in this movie, but allow me to touch specifically on a few. liam neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of. honestly, this man is like ice cream: even when he's bad he's good. his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him, in the best way he knows how. jessica lange, as mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure. you just know she doesn't take any b.s from rob, or anyone else for that matter. tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald, yet somehow, it works. all the posturing and preening, combined with some wicked dialogue, result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory. combine all of this, and the stellar work by other supporting players, with the luscious scenery of scotland, and you have what amounts to one really, really cool movie. if you haven't seen this, i highly recommend that you do.

the year 1995, when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson, also saw another very fine, yet underrated movie on scottish history, rob roy. although it is a very different film, especially due to the historical period the story is set in, rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies.it is a film that discusses similar themes, like fight for dignity, courage, honor, revenge, family being a key to happiness. it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature. robert roy macgregor (liam neeson), the main character is a true hero (so universal in epics), sort of "scottish robin hood" who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords. although he worsens his situation through the acts, has to suffer a lot, two things stay in his mind undeniably: honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman, mary macgregor (jessica lange). that leads him to unexpected events...except for the interesting content and quite vivid action, the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals. this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe. many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images. for me, the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means. then, he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman. the scene he escapes marguis of montrose (john hurt) to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual. of course, there is some graphic violence, like in the duel for instance, but i don't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films. its justification is like any other epic's: bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it. the most disturbing scene, for me, was the rape done on rob roy's wife by the villain of the story: archibald cunningham (tim roth). it's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away. however, all the rest is o.k. yet, there is one aspect that made me really love this movie, the performances.all the cast do perfect jobs, from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall, brave, strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn, a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war. jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film. there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes. john hurt, one of the best british actors, does a terrific job as marguis of montrose, a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means. i like that calmness of his portrayal. but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character, archibald - a man who mocks love, who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter. but, like in any good epic, this exceptional evil must find its end...and one more aspect: the musical score: such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long. the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations. scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect. it was, as if, my second journey to scotland.rob roy is a very nice movie, very well directed, photographed and acted. it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes, but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have: stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education. i really enjoyed that film, do not hesitate to call it metaphorically "highlands of entertainment" and rate it 9/10

i haven't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty. i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart. it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters. ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like, messy hair and beard with simple clothing. also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him, he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy. it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace. gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter. the story contains a little romance, conspiracy and an underdog story. sound anything like braveheart? but instead of a film that cries out "freedom", liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour, love and justice. this makes it a more interesting film. much like gladiator. the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour. the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic. this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do. overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch. go and see it!

this is a very exciting and romantic film. i have seen it several times and never get bored with it. everything is realistic and it is a good plot. the actors are excellent liam neeson, jessica lange, tim roth and brian cox.i actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes. there is many exciting scenes - watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene. this is really good and surprising scenes.the music are lovely...it really suits to the movie. the setting is amazing.

i loved this movie. the scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. on two fronts, however, "rob roy" scored far above average. first, i have rarely seen a "popular" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. i could give numerous examples, but why should i? just watch the film. second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. for a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a really believable villain. if you don't have one, there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys. and "rob roy" has not one, but three--the earl of montrose, his henchman kilairn, and archie. not one-dimensional villains, either, but fully fleshed and very nasty. it takes a bit more patience than "braveheart"--there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit tough, but it's a much more clever and subtle piece. (as i said, i loved this movie!)

a very engaging, intelligent, and well-made film. liam neeson and tim roth play their roles superbly. the cinematography is outstanding. the fight scenes are amazing. this is a film i will enjoy watching again and again. one of my favorites.

when braveheart first came out, i was enthralled, and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film. when rob roy came out, i was intrigued, and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film. however, as time has gone by, my appreciation for rob roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished. braveheart is great entertainment, to be sure, but there are flaws as well. the most significant, in my view, is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce, who was without a doubt scotland's greatest king. another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, that the beginnings of mel gibson's egomania can be seen clearly for the first time. in contrast, rob roy has grown on me over the years. partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart. but also because rob roy is like fine wine, growing more mature and complex with each viewing.

rob roy is and underrated epic of passion and action!some mild spoilers within. liam neeson gives a towering performance as rob roy macgregor,one of the best in his career.jessica lange is letter-perfect as his wife mary.they have the most passion and chemistry i've seen in a screen couple.john hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.tim roth portrays one of the great screen villains.his rape of mary is repugnant and harrowing.he really is a magnificent bastard in this movie.the final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best swordfights ever.well scripted ans scored,and michael caton-jones direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.

i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie. some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. don't listen to them!!! if you like shawshank redemption and/or braveheart, you will definitely love this movie!the acting performances are superb! tim roth, john hurt and jessica lang are allsuperb and liam neeson does an admarible job and is a very imposing character because of his size. the cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. it is onw of the few movies i have seen in my life (along with shawshank) that was virtually flawless from casting, directing, writing, acting, etc.!!!i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. i felt so passionately about it that i just registered with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop. i have seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone has loved it! you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning. if you have the attention span longer than most of these juvenille kids writing reviews for the movies on this site, than you will love this movie! come on...all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at #32?!?! that should show you the age range of most reviewers here!this is a top 50 movie!!!

to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart. though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well. roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. scottland is still run by english nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. rob roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that braveheart was. there are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. rob roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor. he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose (john hurt). things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. sounds fair enough, doesn't it? problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves. one of them, known as archibald cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. played wonderfully by tim roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother. this man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. he rapes macgregor's wife and burns him out of his home. this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. along with another crony of the marquis (brian cox) cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt. this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.spoilers ahead!!!!!luckily for the macgregor's, a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. and for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. just when it looks like rob roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. the first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as cunningham! rob roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. the score is quite memorable, too. the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor. the film is violent, but there isn't too much gore. it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. the film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.the hound.

mel gibson's braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but it left a sour taste in the mouth. rob roy, by contrast, is slightly less polished, but a better film by far. this is a historical film which combines timeless themes with truly historical values, whereas braveheart put a gross and unpleasant comtemporary gloss on an ancient tale. what makes this film is the cast. liam neeson plays the hero, in a role he basically reprised (in a watered-down fashion) in the phantom menace. the character is heroic, but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover. admirable yet human, he commands the screen. against him are set a selection of equally human adversaries including tim roth's cunningham, obnoxious but brilliant, and john hurt's morally bankrupt laird. also to praise is jessica lange, as rob's pragmatic wife: also strong and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, which is only as it should be. this is not the most original film you will see, but it has the courage of its own convictions, and the strong performances make you care.

liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century. he is a true actor. he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary. mary is such a beautiful woman. it's her love that makes rob roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. they need each other. tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find cunningham disgusting. the scotland scenery is beautiful. the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. if you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy rob roy. there is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent. one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. it's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. this is something special.

the early to mid 90s were a high point, in my opinion, for the historical drama. last of the mohicans, braveheart, rob roy - all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective time periods.rob roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by film. it really has everything - interesting story, great acting, remarkable dialog, and breathtaking scenery. i was particularly impressed by the apparently genuine dialog. i can imagine this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved.something else that surprised me was the vulgarity expressed by the characters. i found it to be more repulsive and shocking, albeit often more subtle, than most found in films set in modern times. the movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era.the pace was very tight, with hardly a dull moment. there was much intrigue and political subplots that complicated things a bit, but yet did not detract from the main storyline.the action was also very well done and gripping. something that i will forever find remarkable is that during the highlight action piece in the film, there is no soundtrack whatsoever. it makes for a very tense, exciting sequence, since we have no musical cue as to the direction and resolution of the scene.rob roy will always remain high on my list of favorite films. i would recommend it to all.

this is the moving tale of scotland's legendary hero, rob roy, and his battles with the feudal landowners. like braveheart to which it is frequently compared, it is not very historical. despite their primarily fictional nature, i rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. the 13 century william wallace is, as others have noted, a larger than life national figure, while the early 18th century rob roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary scotsman.the story revolves around a clan chieftain, robert roy mcgregor, who lives in a scottish highland cottage with his wife mary and their two young sons. as the movie begins, he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. rob roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand scottish pounds from a local noble, the marquis of montrose, in order to buy cattle to herd to market. he temporarily entrusts this money to his friend, alan mcdonald. when both mcdonald and the money turn up missing, rob roy finds himself in conflict with montrose as well as his despicable protégé, archibald cunningham, and his sleazy factor, killearn. rob roy's honour is also tested when montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival, the duke of argyle, whom he wishes to accuse of being a jacobite.the charismatic liam leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander rob roy, an intelligent, virile, and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. personally, i feel that this is neeson's best performance, his brogue (albeit irish) adding authenticity for the average viewer. rob roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, and honest man whose word can be trusted. he is a loving husband & father, and also touchingly loyal to his friend, mcdonald, who is accused of robbing him. tim roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, archibald cunningham, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock. he is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women, whether willing or otherwise. the pathetic cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity, though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder, rape, and thievery. also, he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl, betty, after she becomes pregnant with his child, resulting in her suicide. john hurt plays the arrogant and foppish montrose, who is eventually implied to be cunningham's father.the movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife, beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between rob roy and mary. those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! i think the phrase used by this pair, 'how fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. the most compelling performance is possibly by jessica lange as rob's wife, mary mcgregor. lacking make up, she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. the actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable cunningham, while the disgusting killearn looks on. her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. i give hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as mary's pain and humiliation, but nothing intended to sensationalize. their kinsman, alastair mcgregor, shows emotional anguish when he learns of mary's rape, and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by cunningham. of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the scottish highlands, also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. there are no grand battle scenes as in braveheart, but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between rob roy and cunningham. this is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale.

its not braveheart( thankfully),but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around. i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week,find it has held up well over time. not a classic film,but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment.

this is a very good, under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.the basic story concerns rob roy's borrowing of 1000 pounds, its theft, and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen.cunningham( tim roth) is an amazing villain and character in this story. brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil.rob roy (liam neeson) is excellent too, but i think the writers used the word "honour" 1 too many times.the rest of the cast is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed.the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic, but not too gory. the story is good and you really want rob to win.all in all just shy of a classic.

this sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. it is often compared to "braveheart" because both movies take place in historical scotland. even though i love braveheart, i think this is the better of the two films. jessica lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an oscar). liam neeson is fantastic in the title role. tim roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an oscar). john hurt is excellent as lord montrose, another dislikeable character. i am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that john hurt can play. this is a story of a dispute over money between rob roy and his clan, and lord montrose. rob roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with montrose if it violates his sense of honor. montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. and that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. this movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. it has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. one of my favorite films.

overshadowed by "braveheart" released the same year, the two costume dramas beg comparison. i admit my bias against mel gibson, yet i maintain a rational preference for "rob roy." both "braveheart" and "rob roy" compellingly depict scots history in bloody, romantic fashion. "braveheart" is an epic paean to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. it's also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. note its cornball usage of slow motion filming. its violence is both ugly and glorious. it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset. while "braveheart" surpasses "rob roy" in sheer levels of carnage (not to mention its indulgent running time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. its sex is less showy, yet more erotic. "rob roy" also has a better realized romantic interest. its dialog attempts to approximate the poetry of the period. its rotted teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to approximate the dentistry of the era. and tim roth is a superlative villain. also recommended: "the last of the mohicans" and "the patriot." you may find the latter more akin to "braveheart" with its emphasis on blood lust, with the former more similar to "rob roy" in tone. all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence.

**attention spoilers**first of all, let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's. it was an amazing achievement for all those involved, especially the acting of liam neeson, jessica lange, john hurt, brian cox, and tim roth. michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. but alas...it constantly, and unfairly gets compared to "braveheart". these are two entirely different films, probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland. yet, this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". i like "braveheart" a lot, but the idea of comparing it to "rob roy" is a little insulting to me. to put quite simply, i love "braveheart", but it is a pale shadow to how much i love "rob roy". here are my particular reasons...-"rob roy" is about real people.let's face it, the william wallace in "braveheart" is not a real person. he's a legend, a martyr, a larger than life figurehead. because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing wrong, and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land. when he finally does fail, it is not to his fault. like jesus, he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most. he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much.the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective. but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me. i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection. that is why "the last temptation of christ" is a better film than "king of kings", and that is also one of the reasons why i think "rob roy" is better than "braveheart". rob roy may be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones. now sure, not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness. let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act. but rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask of him.rob's wife mary, is also a normal, ambigious person. let us start though, with how she looks in this film. sure, she's beautiful, but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show. compare this with the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) of william wallace in "braveheart". now these two ladies are hot, but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time (especially the lay persons). maybe not a fair comparison, but just another example of how rob roy's attempts for accuracy are far more effective.throughout "rob roy", mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion, cunningham. she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle, but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape. such revenge would surely mean the death of rob, and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice.the villains in "rob roy" are equally as compelling. although the enemies in "braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. robert the bruce, a man both brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm. should he take his claim as the king of scotland, or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name? bruce is the most ambigious character in "braveheart", but from brutus in "julius ceasar" to fredo in "the godfather part ii", these types of characters are hardly original. longshanks, although a compelling villain in his own right, is very one dimensional. he is the epidemy of evil, and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace's heroism."rob roy" has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery. first of all, let's start with marquis of montrose. he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image, that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "see to it that i am not mocked" are his favorite words to his "factor". he is a man obsessed with power, upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him. he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure. he is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique.cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in "rob roy", and are also roy's direct assailants. callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical. he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis, which includes backstabbing and trickery. cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis. he needs a father, little does he know that the marquis is his real father. therefore, when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. he is very much like the evil of modern man, so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others.many have criticized tim roth's performance in this film as overacting. hogwash i say. it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film. in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement, is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character? we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life. "rob roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed. it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion. rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world.another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll. he is a true nobleman, and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis. he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary, and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor. he gives the world hope for the people of power. hopefully, people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule.- the final duel in "rob roy" is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in "braveheart".one thing i get tired of is people telling me that "braveheart" is a better film because of the battle scenes. first of all, battle scenes are hardly original. from "spartacus" to "gladiator", hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes. "braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film, but they suffer from one important problem. these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom.now, don't get me wrong, duels are hardly original either. in fact, there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes. but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold. it is one of the greatest scenes in film history. let me explain why...first of all, the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. cunningham is effette and dangerous, rob roy is strong and courageous. cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword. cunningham fights with quick tricky movements, while roy's fighting style is more obvious.the whole film, from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half, is leading up to this moment. it is powerful stuff, and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. when rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively,) it is one of the greatest moments in film history. rob wins because he has more to live for, and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham's. the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell "freedom!". but hey, maybe that's just me.- "rob roy" is more realistic than "braveheart"i don't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in "rob roy", but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. i feel that many people are bored by "rob roy" simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying. if this is the case, then read some shakesphere, or put on the close-captioning. "rob roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. many of the dialogue in this film is clever, but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it.by contrast, the dialogue in "braveheart" is hardly very interesting. of course, what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian? this is a legend, and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times. this film takes place several centuries before "rob roy", and yet they talk like the people today. thus the reason that many people like it better. audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. therefore, as with many epic films, they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language. sure, it is clear that the wallace is scotish, but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of "aye"s for acknowledgement, the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound.so, do these descriptions prove that "rob roy" is a better film than "braveheart"? hardly. but if it proves one thing, it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that "braveheart" is a better film than "rob roy". to put simply, "rob roy" is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today's world. "braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic. you can make a decision on what you think is better...grade - a score - 9

major spoilers!! this is for people who have seen the movie!!commenters have touched on the major theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons to "braveheart." i'll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on:this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. the first character to get pregnant is the villain's (roth) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. the shame of her situation ("i'm to have a bastard's bastard.") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. the second character to find herself pregnant is mary, rob's wife, after a rape by roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, rob). late in the movie, as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth, mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a tone hinting of abortion. rob replies in a noble tone, "it's not the fault of the child," and then states what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. i find this "pro-life" stance on the part of the hero to be very un-hollywood. rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism.another related theme is roth's character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who his father was, and has few kind words for his mother, though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. is it coincidence that roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. in the final sword fight between rob and the villain (roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. his employer and pseudo-father figure (john hurt character) holds the mother's picture in his hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth.also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. i found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction, with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take.in the final fight scene, i have to correct an earlier commenter: the weapon roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon rob chose was a claymore. someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon. what is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made: the actors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). even more true to history, roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it's purpose by design! (rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) rob uses the claymore in broad slashes, as it's design intent. the fight goes down as i would expect it to -- roth effectively wins. though rob wins the day by grabbing roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.folks, it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.i'll also note that for whatever reason, i remember 1995 (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the u.s. government. hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both "rob roy" and "braveheart," and i think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from hollywood.

what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and occasionally most weirdly -i wont say 'sympathetic'..i will say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the cinema, and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday? this is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. i loved it. john hurt and tim roth were great villains. jessica lange was very moving, tender, and sensual.

this is one powerful film. the first time i saw it, the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd, used the english subtitles when i needed them, and really got into this movie, discovering just how good it is. it is excellent.the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts, with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart, an involving tale of good versus evil. here, it's liam neeson (good) vs. tim roth (evil). both do their jobs well.few actors come across as despicable as roth. man, you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant, irritating puss. (he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart. jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead. the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved, so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this.

this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective. while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward. in truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.poor vs. rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)

michael caton-jones's scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name...the film opens in the scottish highlands, with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham's cattle... the scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs, adorned shirts, soft colored coats, paleface make-up and conventional gestures...macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose... when he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with montrose, he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose's evil-doers... the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie, though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape... when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers, the action becomes well understood, ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade...liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character... he is intelligent, fair and virile... he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community... he is a loving father, a passionate lover, and a noble husband, driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains... he'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust... oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife, a proud peasant woman, brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat... lange's lines are filled with dignity and integrity: 'i will think on you dead, until my husband makes you so. and then i will think on you no more.'john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis, ruthless with money and tempered by the english court's fashion for foppery... he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service... honor, in his view, seems a quaint notion... he has two objectives: ruin the reputation of his rival, the duke of argyle, and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor... he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders' homes, to kill their people and their livestock...tim roththe perfect antithesis to the hero, is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer... he is a penniless british aristocrat, a nasty 'hired sword' wonderfully evil, ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist... his name is archibald cunningham... he turns out to be a liar, a thief and a murderer... he dismisses himself as 'but a bastard abroad, seeking his fortune and the favors of great men," and therefore can't care about anyone else: "love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow." he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl...cunningham seems pathetic... he smiles foolishly, and utters words with affected refinement, but not terribly harmful-until a muscular swordsman insults him, and we discover that he's a cool head and an expert with a sword... he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination...and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn, andrew keir is montrose's rival, the powerful local aristocrat, the duke of argyll, one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family... set in 18th-century scotland, and with an atmospheric musical score, 'rob roy' is really a love story between a man and his wife, a recognizably human story, unjustly dwarfed by mel gibson's 'braveheart,' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords...

from the excellent acting of an extremely impressive cast, to the intelligently written (and very quotable) script, from the lavish cinematography to the beautiful music score by carter burwell, rob roy offers a rarity in movie going experiences: one that is nigh impossible to find fault with in any area.there have been several comparisons made with braveheart, which came out the same year. with all due credit to mel gibson, braveheart struck me as too much of a self-conscious and preachy epic to rival rob roy as the kind of movie i would care to see more than once. while braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, rob roy just grabs you and absorbs you into its tightly edited storytelling. not a single scene is wasted.rob roy contains the perfect balance of dramatic tension, action and even occasional humor. the characters are well fleshed-out, perfectly conveying vernacular and mannerisms that anchor them in their authentic period setting.further, they are not caricatures of good and evil as we all too often observe in even modern film.for example, while we hope the heroic rob roy prevails, we realize his predicaments are products of his own pride and sense of honor. tim roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in the history of cinema, yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life have shaped him into becoming what he is. rob roy employs a level of character development that makes its story even more believable and gripping.rob roy is a delightful treasure, featuring one of the greatest sword fights ever choreographed and a climatic ending worthy of all the tense anticipation.

i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrock's films, and to me this is the funniest. it reminds me of early jackie chan movies. admittedly, ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress, but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady. this film, while probably not the best of all her films, was the most entertaining.

i'm a huge fan of the twin sisters. although this was one of their "not soo good" movies. i'm not saying it's bad, i can't say it's bad, but this whole popular and not popular thingy isn't good. although i give this movie a 4.

i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of mary-kate's and ashley's characters sam and emma stanton! they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but; unfortunately, it's just not that easy for them to actually do! i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here! if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed-out; big time, and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now! this movie is a real winner! sincerely, rick morris

this movie is so good i could watch it all day long! mary-kate and ashley were robbed at oscar time!! if i got to be one of the actors i would be so excited!!! i can't wait for the new charlie's angels movie starring mary-kate and ashley.

i, as a teenager really enjoyed this movie! mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease. i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to! be sure and rent it!! also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players! :)

i think that this movie was reasonbaly good. it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house. anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. it's just kind of an older version of it takes two.

trapped: buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened, and is soon to close.we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts, to avoid the possibility of avalanches. somehow, that doesn't make sense. anyways, he's about to blow away one particularly big one, when he notices the resort is open. despite his best efforts, higher authority tells him his day is over.soon, as everyone expects, an avalanche hits.look, i'm not gonna reveal any more, all i can say is this was a b-movie designed for the family channel (which i just saw it on, and the fact it had no commercials proves it's a b-movie) anyways, it's a pretty decent film, but it's partially unreal.firsthand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they're buried. not just traced by powder. or, what about a cd for a screwdriver? it's not possible. and finally, what i can't stress enough, is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche, guaranteed.furthermore, it's worth a rental or a tv viewing, but not owning. 7/10.the movie is rated pg, but maybe it should have received something a little more strong. a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, dead people are laying around.enjoy.

the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his oldfriends.but there is one problem, the friends are superfighters. the film is filled with blood, super action and the best stunts forever. and lau ching-wan is a great co-actor. of course the movie has the typical hk-fun.but i love it! in germany "black mask" is uncut.

this is definitely one of jet's best efforts. few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can. the action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. as a result, it may take americans a little off-guard. a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film. i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially fist of legend) making it into the us market. a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.

i'm no big fan of martial arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon 4 and i got it free when the other films i'd rented, either way i rented it. i absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old biochemistry and accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. i can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila). i never enjoyed bruce lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action.

once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask. in this film li plays tsui, an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him. to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace. thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. the martial arts is amazing, but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences. if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts, then black mask is for you. i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. this is one of li's best films, go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america.

i am a massive fan of jet li! he is the best hk action film star alive... and consequently - this film rocked! i saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, i didnt register its presence at first, and had to look twice. i immediately knew what i would be renting out. my only qualm (i suppose i expected it) is that it was dubbed (aaargh) and not subtitled. elsewise, the movie's original/strange/cool plot, and full on action made it one of jet li's better movies... even though they all fall under that category....

i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it. then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it. i am ready to watch it again.i am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian? the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my favortites.of course the martial arts are stunning. there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style. however, if you are not... we paused playback briefly and walker, texas ranger was on. we noticed that after every strike there was a cut. not in black mask.

this movie is rich with action and gore. the story line is strong enough to support the action sequences. the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable. this movie ranks among my personal favorites next to "hard boiled" ...

hak hap(black mask)is what i'd like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (a biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian. but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask.) the style that the movie goes for, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining. i love martial arts movies that are a spectical. people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop. but that is what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of jet li doing what he does best, and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch. as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala. jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time, these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats. but i must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape? who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment.......ohh well suspension of belief i guess) , the movie to me stays interesting. it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter. but still all around a great high paced action movie.

now let me tell you about this movie, this movie is my favorite movie!!! this movie has excellent combat fighting. this movie does sound like a silly story line about how jet li plays a super hero, like spider-man, or etc. but once you've seen this movie, you would probably want to see it again and again. i rate this movie 10/10.

very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee .li is excellent as the low key librarian/cop who saves all time and time again . he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with .francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage , she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable .the villain , the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits , can some one help me out with that ? thanks ! enjoy hak hap or black mask , in any language its good entertainment !

ok, it's not a perfect movie by any means but i disagree with the overall imdb opinion that it's really really bad. i watched a lot of hong kong flix in the 1990's and loved the era dearly. i never saw 'black mask' at the time and only saw it last week for the first time. apart from the embarrassingly poor dubbing which my dvd copy didn't give me the option to turn off, the movie contains the raw energy and bravado that permeated hong kong movies during this time. i still stick to my guns in the opinion that, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, add an element of magic to the screen no bourne supremacy, casino royale or mission impossible (i'm not knocking these movies - i just reckon they lack the spontaneity of this one and feel too regulated) will ever achieve. what is it? it's the feeling that the film-makers were experimenting as they shot and edited, not afraid to leave in some blemishes so as to learn lessons for the next time. for me, this makes watching movies, all the more fun and dangerous.

what more could i say? the americans totally hated it because the u.s. cut was so bad, although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it.talking about the u.s. theatrical release(along with the newly released blu-ray disc version), it's faster and tighter than hk cut, the background musics were all changed from the dark, grim hk musics to hip-hop musics; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out. though, the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor's voice and tone. but, the problem is hak hap(black mask) the movie was designed and meant to be dark, grim, super-disturbing and totally gruesome. very unfortunately the u.s. release just skimmed the cream they wanted, which in return completely changed the movie's undertone(hk release was rated 18+) to be even more comical and amateurish.now let's talk about the original hk release. this movie is like a hidden gem, a prototype for the whole "matrix" tide and era. the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit "old-school" among hk movies. however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture. with all the leather, black costumes and decorations, this movie features a batman-like superhero in a black mask against a run-of-the-mill gang of multinational super-soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss. yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child, but it works. it's so impressive that the whole movie's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats. in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg-13 rating, but without jet li and liu qing yun. and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship. and, did i happen to mention francois yip? her roundhouse kick was totally cool, even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting. did i mention she was also smoking hot? anyway, there are a lot of things to like about the movie.however, the movie also suffered from a lot of problems. first off, it's a mediocre script made at its best potential, which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer. there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences(us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut). anyway, you can't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie. also, this movie is entirely improper for children. i won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old. it's saturated with disturbing contents including blood, gore, sado-maso costumes, extreme brutal violence and so on. along with the style of the movie, it can be called a wet dream for heavy-metal rock music fans and action fans. (the u.s. cut was milder, but if you want to see it, see the hk release for what it is.) 7/10. status: inspiring, hidden, undervalued, adult.

this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort. this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li. this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions, including the once upon a time in china series. the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work. i only saw the wires in two shots. aside from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as filler. to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area. they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint.

this is a very strange hk film in many ways. first, many of the action sequences really aren't that much fun. the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly. not cool silly, or even funny silly, but just silly. that's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but most simply don't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen. the opposite side is that this film actually has characters, not just people. all of the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well acted. all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch. the dialogue is quite witty, and doesn't seem to lose much in translation. this film is worth seeing, but i hope that uninitiated american audiences don't think this is the best hk has to offer.

in black mask, jet li plays a bio-engineered super-killer turned pacifist, who has to fight against other super-killers. bad plot, bad sfx(60 million dollar budget), but the fighting scenes were excellent! jet li is the greatest martial-arts star alive!

i can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li. fist of legend would have been a much better choice. anyway, black mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix. but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (i'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. more focus on li's fantastic physical skills were in order. black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li's skills.

this film appears to draw a borderline - on one side, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable.to begin with, there is an awful lot of comedy in this film that many viewers are not "getting". of course jet li's mask looks like bruce lee's kato - he's supposed to, it's a joke. the guy who has a time-bomb sewn to his heart - outrageous? of course, it's a joke! some readers will probably ask, if this film is supposed to be so funny, why all the excessive and gory violence? well, for one thing the tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and while hong kong audiences would recognize this violence is extreme, it's certainly only slightly more than average for a hk action film.also, black mask is really the kind of film that takes a genre's conventions and pushes them to extremes, simply because the conventions themselves are wholly unrealistic. after decades of watching people get shot without any noticeable open wounds, many people were horrified to see bonnie and clyde and the outlaws of the wild bunch spurting blood all over the place. but the fact is, when you're shot with rapid metal projectile, it's almost certain that blood will spurt, especially from an artery.this film is a chinese comic book movie. it is true that the spiderman films never get this gory - but if they were faithful to reality, they would be! well, despite its comic-book origins, this film is faithful to reality.the only complaint i have is the flashy, over-stylized filming and editing. if the makers of this film had shot it with an eye to hollywood-style nostalgia (as, e.g., the rocketeer, or the recent sky captain film), i doubt anyone would have found it offensive.but as it stands, i still had a lotta fun watching this movie.

anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie. the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping, who also did the fights in the matrix. and the fight scenes are somethin.li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (ya got me). when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade, li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them.there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie (one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices). the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches; the body count is way up there. li has seldom been better, and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars (yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier). anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord (no suprises there; he makes a cameo in every hk movie). it's unfortunate they don't make action movies like this in the us; i wouldn't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much. recommended.

the story would never win awards, but that's not what it's about... the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. who needs a story with fighting like that? really, it's worth watching for that reason alone. if you can handle the gore, of which there is a lot... none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at. i gave it a 7.

i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds. but this movie i enjoyed, mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films. most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action. and mindless action is right. you get to see jet li jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. it's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4. that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped. most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film. but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film, and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them. if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing.my rating was an 8.

in stand by me, vern and teddy discuss who was tougher, superman or mighty mouse. my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too. sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix. but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan, bruce lee and jet li. it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead, but it is a fun one. and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask, you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan. in this film he comes across as a martial arts god.black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men, to be supreme fighting machines. their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. they are invincible in some ways. now that is the premise for the film, but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.jet li is a marvel. he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do. and that is what makes watching him so fun.besides the martial arts in the film, black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star, the police officer. they are great together. but to be honest. if anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department. and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action. you will love this film.

i have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many imdb users (some are saying it's his 'worst movie ever.' what?? haven't any of you seen cradle 2 the grave?) my favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. duh! what the crap were you expecting from a jet li movie? did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story, then just loaded it up with action? of course not! black mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time. it's also deliciously gruesome, and we get plenty of severed limbs, decapitations, and creative ways of watching the bad guys (and quite a few innocent people, too!) get slaughtered. most of li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to black mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences whatsoever! and that made me a happy camper. again: if you go into a jet li movie expecting magnificent dialog and an intriguing plot, you are going for the wrong reasons. black mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of the horrendous dubbing).

well i gave this movie a 7. it was better than "thirdspace" but not as good as "in the beginning" as far as the b5 movies go. i really think the television series did a much better job overall with the special effects and character portrayal. let's hope the producers and cast get the next series "crusade" up to the standards of b5.

an excellent film with great performances from zack & lochley. much to their displeasure (& mine) garibaldi arrived on station. (all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 & 5 i lost sympathy for the character.) it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack (who i love best of all on the show)and taking charge. i'm sure zack could have coped. the soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as zack does. the humour supplements it nicely. 10/10

i thought "the river of souls" was a very good babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances from martin sheen, tracy scoggins and ian macshane. if this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series.personally, i've always preferred scoggins to christian, although granted jms didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the byron/telepath plot. if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. probably my third favourite of the four movies, but in no means bad at all.

let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice, i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie. those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors. the acting was better than average, but the plot held no surprises. they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation. now as to the historical errors, if you call them that, the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april, then capt. pike, jim kirk, etc.. according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's the reason a prime directive was created) but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series. i hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a backseat.

i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember. when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very excited.the premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait. it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters. the nx-01, enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love.scott bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer. jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol. that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of starfleet.enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series well worth watching, and i recommend that. watch it.

this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series. it has a "down to earth"-kind of feel with darker and less "plaggy" scenography.the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential. one thing that is fairly disappointing (with all star trek series really) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (earth has stopped war, famine etc) the female characters here are two, subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human. hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a "vulcan babe". some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american (as opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew) but creates interesting dynamics. a very good pilot though for a very good series.

there is star trek canon -- lots of it. from canon we know the history of the future. advances in technology, events, places, first contacts with new beings, names, dates, etc.enterprise pretty much disregards much of st canon. an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans. as one, i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of tos and retro back from there -- but no.the phase pistols, like much of the technology, look much more modern than found in tos. an old style starfleet laser gun, a slow gold speckle transporter effect -- that's what i expected to see. also, i did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects similar to tng but far apart from tos sound effects. in the earliest view of tos (the original pilot: the cage), we see a starfleet with a more formal military aspect -- a bit of old earth navy. with enterprise, we see a shocking disregard for rank. there is more military code in the cartoon star blazers than in enterprise.it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe (quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his application of human justice), but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal. unprofessional, unsure, more distant from the feel of formal military service than found in any st series -- and that says a lot!the casual country music opening theme song heralds the journeys of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military vessel.enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun, warm-fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic, bold, gritty, high-rick exploration of space.i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor. still, i liked the actors for the most part. linda park, an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college, is sure to develop nicely. the characters making up the crew seem to be thoughtfully created.enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series. let's hope for a good future!

enterprise is the entertainment, but it is also the forefront of science fiction and a positive outlook for tomorrow. with gratitude and respect mr. berman and mr. braga. i wish you well, thank you both for your service to trek.enterprise is what trek is about...

call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series. if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series, you should definitely watch this one. perhaps more compelling than that of voyager's caretaker, which launched the series with cpt. janeway, archer's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...the music is catchy too. no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.

i remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoying this. i recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since then, as it was aired on "walt disney presents" on the disney channel. i'd forgotten most of it, and some of it was geared towards kids, but it was still enjoyable. i can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews.

this is what i was expecting when star trek ds9 premiered. not to slight ds9. that was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted. enterprise is that show. while having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways. it makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again. and that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved. another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members. viewers really cared deeply for the crew. enterprise has much promise in this area as well. the chemistry between bakula and blalock seems very promising. while sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, i feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical. i think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television. also, we should note the performances, blalock is very convincing as vulcan t'pol and bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance. the rest of the cast delivered good performances also. my only gripes are as follows. the theme. it's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking. we need something a little more grand. doesn't have to be orchestral. maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice. and my one other complaint. they sell too many adds. they could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters. otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of voyager.

"secret of the lens" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine. the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. i wish he did more campiness like this.my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence, the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen, the party riots that bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, worsle appears.check this out.warning:this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans!

people don't seem to be giving lensman enough credit where its due. a few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the lensman experience.the year: for the year it was made in (1984) lensman features some of the most stunning effects i've ever seen. as a person who watches a lot of early 80's animation lensman is unique in it's use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. kim's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. every time i watch that i have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made.the soundtrack: lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that i've heard, and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film. lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine. while the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the thionite factory on radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of chris. it's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when i was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point.western influences: helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has roughly the same voice as darth vader. clarissa fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of sw and her name sounds suspiciously similar to marissa fairborn of transformers. takes over han solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise. buzzkirk - a definite improvement on chewbaka. the lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach christianity at the audience than in the original sw. while the force relied on belief far more than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. theoretically, anyone could wield the lens. the lens is far more limited than the force - being purely a defensive/offensive weapon.technology: the boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships. they look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white. the idea of a dna weapon was nice if only it had been developed. the galactic alliance looked like starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60's series where they were battling the xylons). there weren't enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second lensman film.finally a note on worzel. this character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film.

lensman is a rather lesser-known anime gem from toho and mk studios.it's loosely based on the novel,but it reminds me more of the game "metroid".if you want to see this,see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain japanese.the english dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to death.there is not much new,despite the fact that it's the 1st animated feature to combine cg-graphics with hand-drawn animation,but it's fun to watch,nevertheless.

though i like e.e. "doc" smith's books and david a. kyles books of lensman, the anime, which is loosly based on the books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.though the story may seem familiar to sci-fi/fantasy buffs, such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family, it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless. plus, lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once. sure, it may look a bit outdated now, but it is still an innovation. if it were not for lensman, none of that would have ever happened (personally, i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action.)too bad they only released it on dvd/vcd in a few countries in the worls (mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different). i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd/vcd in every part of the world, not just certain parts.p.s. worsel rules! i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well.

the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring, they were so noble as to be unbelievable. i also like the sub-plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans. its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs. it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two, though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show. the only negatives that jumped out at me were the "quick cut off the ending at 2 hours" feel of the end, which is common among many of the trek shows. the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes. it was out of place, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre-teen audience with some skin. but its not my job to make the show profitable, so oh well.lets see how the next episode does.

i, like many die-hard trekkers (or trekkies, i don't care!) suffered through seven seasons of "star trek voyager", dreaming of a better show when it was over, lamenting the end of "deep space nine" in 1999. prayers, answered. "enterprise" is fantastic. fresh perspective, radically different characters, stunning new visuals, a pop-song for the intro. (i was shocked!) i can't think of anything i didn't like. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "star trek" is back - "voyager," nobody misses you! keep on trekkin'!>

i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet, i say potential.. we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas... but i hope not! for those that have not seen it..see it! without that annoying "prime directive" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool.. and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain, and the vulcan babe is hot too, (check out the decontamination scene)i gave this a full 10... it blows away all the other series openers.. i hope this goes longer than 7 years...

ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. starting with the technology. when star trek: tos ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. in the 35 years seince tos premiered, the crew of star trek have become experts at economy.ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all. so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii? as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200. nothing was firmly established.enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. this is what voyager could have been. no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that star trek has so few. so, quit gripping and enjoy.

after 7 years of watching that dreadful nonsense called star trek voyager i was feeling pretty numb. next gen and ds9 were bloody good stuff and voyager ruined tv trek. this opened with probably the best pilot to a trek show. the crew were really good as were the choice of actors for the parts. scott bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unpolished way of doing things was a refreshing change to the already know everything captains from before. the rest of the crew were really likable in their roles and i think they got off to a good first season. when the show was prematurely canceled i was really disappointed. in a mirror darkly showed us what the cast were capable of. pity a film or tv movie was never considered. so much back story and founding of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the klingons..........

okay, the recent history of star trek has not been good. the next generation faded in its last few seasons, ds9 boldly stayed where no one had stayed before, and voyager started very bad and never really lived up to its promise. so, when they announced a new star trek series, i did not have high expectations. and, the first episode, broken bow, did have some problems. but, overall it was solid trek material and a good romp.i'll get the nits out of the way first. the opening theme is dull and i don't look forward to sitting through it regularly, but that's what remotes are for. what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene that just about drove my wife out of the room. they need to cut that nonsense out.but, the plot was strong and moved along well. the characters, though still new, seem to be well rounded and not always what you would expect. the vulcans are clearly being presented very differently than before, with a slightly ominous theme. i particularly liked the linguist, who is the first star trek character to not be able to stand proud in the face of death, but rather has to deal with her phobias and fears. they seemed to stay true to trek lore, something that has been a significant problem in past series, though they have plenty of time to bring us things like shooting through shields, the instant invention of technology that can fix anything, and the inevitable plethora of time-travel stories. anyone want to start a pool on how long before the borg show up?all in all, the series has enormous potential. they are seeing the universe with fresh eyes. we have the chance to learn how things got the way they were in the later series. how did the klingons go from just insulting to war? how did we meet the romulans? how did the federation form and just who put earth in charge. why is the prime directive so important? if they address these things rather than spitting out time travel episodes, this will be an interesting series.my favorite line: zephram cochran saying "where no man has gone before" (not "no one")

a very good start. i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: it should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series. the cast is interesting, although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human. she needs to school on spock who, after all, is the model for this race. too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan. i like ms. park, the korean(?)lady. the doctor has possibilities. haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy. he's a really likeable. bakula needs to find his niche--in ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. he is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics. the heavies were ok, although i didn't like their make-up.

a strong pilot, this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for "enterprise," the "prequel" to the original "star trek" series. it stumbles a few times into "trek" convention and cliché--candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style, and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as "seven of vulcan"--but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well-drawn, and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful, in different ways, than those of earlier (later?) series. scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger, and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator anymore!) as supporting players. the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in "star trek: the next generation," "deep space 9" and "voyager": instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift, it's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later--which i hope happens, because after about a half-dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.

enterprise, the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'broken bow'. first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban (who are the main enemy in the first season of the show). from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is, with some of the best character development, story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time.the opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans, whom some believe that the song is out of place. what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves. if one listens to the actual song, instead of the theme, then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together. and eventually as the series progresses further and further, and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew, will the song actually become meaningful. overall diane warren's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson.what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered. enterprise is (in my opinion) one of the most well cast shows since the next generation. choosing scott bakula, as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean-luc picard. as the captain always leads the show, bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins. he simply is (both actor wise and character wise) a superb human being and his charm, wit, and compassion are overwhelming to watch. as for the other cast members, a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr. phlox. it's also nice to see a non-human playing a role, and the decision to give the captain a dog, named 'porthos' was a well-received idea. throughout the show character development was brilliant, it was fast, well timed and almost perfect. i say almost because sadly travis mayweather's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season. he does have some things to say here and there, but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important. jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol. dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer. connor trinneer plays commander charles "trip" tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato, who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting. all of these characters make up enterprise, and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time. each person makes this show worth watching. smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx-01.the ship itself, the nx-01 is somewhat questionable in design. the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk. so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships, namely the akira class starship? continuity has been an issue in enterprise, but thankfully rick [berman] and brannon [braga] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them. continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details. if you see the show with and open mind, then you'll have no problems, but there is an urge to know 'why' all the time. so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself? according to them the nx-01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact. when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise-e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker, it changed the ideas in his head. that's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on. of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer, some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer. come on guys grow up.when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy, fans couldn't do anything, only watch and sap it all up anyway. and then they learned that, well maybe its not that bad after all. if you can't accept a quality show for what it is, not what it should be in your mind, then go elsewhere. or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do.the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine. they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military. perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise (aka flagship of the american fleet) like it so much. they are striking sets, and represent the show perfectly.rick berman 'the overlord of the empire' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have, and in all the right places. whether that be technicalities, visuals, sound, editing or score. enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be, when in the hands of geniuses. the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan, so should you.

in 2151, in broken bow, oklahoma, a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital. the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor. however, captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet. jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr. phlox, who is treating klaang, to complete his crew, and the vulcan sub-commander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise. when the equipment of the starship is shut-down, klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital. after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting, captain archer is informed by dr. phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x. they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier, bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronos.in spite of being a huge fan of star trek, i have not followed the episodes of "enterprise" on cable television. i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me. the adventure of the first enterprise, captain jonathan archer, the gorgeous t'pol, reed, mayweather, dr. phlox, hoshi and trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts, but on dvd they are just one, therefore my review is valid for both. i did not like the music score theme, which i found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "broken bow"

when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomon's mines i was very excited. i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure. what i got was a 4 hour long (with commercials) epic that was very slow. the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it. the ending was good (no spoilers here)but i was still left wanting more. well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does "roadhouse 2" so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous. until than if your a fan of king solomon's mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours.

i never had an inkling while watching the movie that it was meant for the idiot box. i always thought that this was some very good successful movie of the late 90's. but after i saw on the internet that this was meant for the tv, i was shocked because for a television film, it is absolutely fantastic!the thing that mostly concerned me was the length. i felt that the one on one battle scene should've been removed as it was completely unnecessary. also, it began to drag towards the end as it seemed as if the adventure was never going to end. on the plus side, there is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with magnificent performances by everyone. i just felt that patrik frayze looked a bit haggard. i also felt that gogool, who looked dementing turned a bit stupid at some scenes.i was delighted by the beautiful landscapes of africa. also, the first half of the movie would have made me give this movie a 9. still, its a great film for the television. 8 out of 10.

true, it does not follow the book very closely, but it's still a very entertaining take on the story. swayze was far better in the role than i expected. and doody avoided the "silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness" portrayal most of us probably expected (cf. kate capshaw in "indiana jones & the temple of doom").at any rate, it's amazingly better than richard chamberlain's awful pair of quatermain flicks.it is very reminiscent of a western in many ways. about the only thing i didn't care for was all the mysticism, but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre. like "how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen?" heh.

"broken bow" takes us back to where it all began. set 150 years in our future and 100 years before kirk, spock and mccoy. this installment of the "star trek" franchise, is in my opinion the first series since "tos" to recapture the feelings of wonder, danger and excitement of "going where no man has gone before". scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer, the first captain of the first "star ship enterprise". he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy. john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr. phlox, and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol. broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks, and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud.

i loved this movie. great storyline and actors and good movie sets. it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack. i can not find it anywhere. please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack. other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating. swayze did a great job. i think this is some of his best work. his past movies were ok, but this one really told a story for a change. this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired. congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.

watched both parts twice. enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero. he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain. i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the "lady in distress". alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. she didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. a man at 50+ can be much sexier (and , patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth, no matter how pretty. hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile.

i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done. my only reservation was alison doody. her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain. it was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like val kilmer, brad pitt, etc. he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie. this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger. it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie. i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated. i am looking forward to seeing this once more, and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles.

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain (or at least is an alan quartermain type of character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply. what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga (with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there). it was labeled by many critics to have been a "great parody," or "unintentional comedy." unintentional is the word. this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. unfortunately, it's witless rather than witty.with this new m4tv mini-series, you get much more story, character development of your lead, solid portrayals, and a fine, even, entertaining blend. this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy. while it features both action and eye candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq, making for a fine, well - thought - out plot, and some nice complementing sub-plots. now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones. nor is it a poor attempt to be so. this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq/ksm saga. filmed on location in south africa, the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas, sa aboriginal cultures, and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.steve boyum totally surprised me with this one, as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision. in fact, i have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. this version rates a 9.8/10 on the "tv" scale from...the fiend :.

if you a purist, don't waste your time - otherwise, hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure. i loved the stewart granger/deborah kerr version - i've seen it dozens of times, but this film is every bit as good, only different. i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film. also, it is a pleasure to see alison doody again (i'm a huge indiana jones fan), patrick swayze is good as quatermain, and the supporting cast is superb. i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception. the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect. if you are looking for entertainment, you won't be disappointed.

king's solomon's mines brings us patrick swayze (playing allan quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in africa, but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son. he finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit. in comes alison deedy (playing elizabeth) whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth's father had sent her. elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father.there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (russians) who want the map also.the movie holds your attention until the end. patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress. patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; in king solomon's minds his character actually smiles a few times. i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong. maybe a little dancing would help. but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it.

this is a sprawling (4 hours) remake of the rider haggard story, with the usual added female and an extraneous subplot with russian soldiers seeking a "stone of power" buried along with the treasure of king solomon. it's very well shot, giving a vivid sense of the wide open spaces of africa, and very well acted. patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain, and allison doody is attractive as elizabeth maitland, who hires quatermain to help rescue her father. sidede onyulo as umbopa, gavin hood as mcnabb and the leader of the russian soldiers (not named in imdb's listing) are also memorable. for all that hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adapt it, this one is well told and, except that it's too long, i enjoyed it. 6/10.

the next-to-last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season; though flawed, 'all our yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. kirk, spock, and mccoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours. but as it turns out, the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate, and using a kind of time travel device, have escaped into the past. each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library,' run by an elderly man named mr. atoz. atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well, and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers. there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:mccoy- where did they go? atoz- wherever they wanted to.the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england, while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past. from here, the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment. spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth, the woman. he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan, 5000 years ago. kirk makes his way back to the library first, and finally convinces mr. atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. spock and mccoy return just before it's too late, leaving zarabeth behind; the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes, destroying the planet. the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though kirk's adventure into the 'english' past is amusing. all in all, a very decent latter-day star trek outing.

there's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. from the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. kirk, spock and mccoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.the librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england, while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. the intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by mariette hartley as a woman exiled to the ice age, and ian wolfe as the urbane librarian. somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode city on the edge of forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. this has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.

this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek. there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. they meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves. you can literally taste the sadness at the end. leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....a love story, the salem witch trials, spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. this one is a classic, don't miss it....i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans!!!!!!

dr. mccoy and mr. spock find themselves trapped in a planet's past ice age, while capt. kirk is in the same planet's colonial period. however, it's the former pair that has the most trying time. besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves, there is a third inhabitant, the beautiful and so sexy zarabeth (mariette hartley). as spock spends more time in this era, he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors, feeling a natural attraction to zarabeth and throwing "caution to the wind" about ever leaving this place. only with dr. mccoy's constant "reminders" does spock hold on to some grasp of reality.this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some "emotion" and nimoy (spock) plays it to the hilt, coming close to knocking the bejesus out of deforest kelly (mccoy). surprising to previous installment, captain kirk (william shatner) wasn't allowed to get the girl, another plus for this one.perennial "old man" ian wolfe assays the role of "mr. atoz," the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past.

kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr. atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library. despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. they have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. then, while a disk is in the viewer, kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv (the 1660s). when mccoy and spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository.while kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, spock and mccoy's is much more eventful, as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment. the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy.spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode--one well worth seeing.fyi--ian wolfe, the excellent character actor, played mr. atoz. i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969. interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years--dying at over 95 years of age!!

the penultimate episode of star trek's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. essentially, spock, mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr. atoz, the librarian. all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon's past. spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the 'city on the edge of forever'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon's present. in the end, all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova. the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.ironically, as william shatner notes in his book "star trek memories," this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way. nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show's executive producer, fred freiberger, that vulcans weren't supposed to fall in love. (p.272) however, freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in "plato's stepchildren," play music with hippies in "the way to eden" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. spock's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner. (p.272) the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time, mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just spock. but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant spock/mccoy performance and the originality of this script. who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet's fate by travelling into their past? this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek'--a genuinely inspired story. shatner, in 'memories', named some of his best "unusual and high quality shows" of season 3 as the enterprise incident, day of the dove, is there in truth no beauty, the tholian web, and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome. (p.273) while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty' is problematic, "all our yesterdays" certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films. i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays.'

an unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. they beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!). in some kind of futuristic library, they meet mr. atoz (a to z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. it turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras. mr. atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another trek prognostication of cds and dvds!). when mr. atoz prepares the machine (the atavachron-what-sis), gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time ("...you're a bully fine coo.. witch! witch! they'll burn ye...!"). spock & mccoy follow kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier.kirk manages to get back to the library first. the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago. this doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, spock & mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan). in any case, spock really shows his nasty side here - forget "day of the dove" and remember "this side of paradise" - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. spock also gets it on with zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son, the result of this union). all these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in. it's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier ("requiem for methuselah"), mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly atoz, who insists that kirk head back to some past era ("you are evidently a suicidal maniac" - great stuff from actor wolfe, last seen in "bread and circuses"). it all works out in the end, but, like i mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. a neat little trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.

i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd. i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series. for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode collections or when sci-fi would re-run the episodes. however, when sci-fi would host the re-runs, they generally stuck to the same episodes. there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn't repeat. does anyone know exactly how long this series ran? it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years. if you loved the twilight zone, night gallery and outer limits, you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.

this series was just like what you would expect from mr.spielberg. it is truly one of those frighting, funny, childish shows that you won't forget. just like outer limits (another great show) this little series does what not a lot can. it was great, and deserved to run longer. it was a great show, that even kids could watch, though some of the shows were a little scary when they wanted to be, but all of them always had a moral at the end (like the twilight zone) that made you realize what situation you didn't want to end up in, or ones that you did. i remember watching some of these on sci-fi when i was 10, and even now, i still enjoy seeing them when i can. truly a fun, imaginative show. i loved it, and still do.

steven spielberg produced, wrote, came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories, so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right? unfortunately wrong. some episodes are just fantastic, but all too often it was a mixed bag. in fact, that might have been it's downfall is it was way too mixed. some episodes were light comedies, some were dramas, some were horror, and one was even animated, which made this a similar, but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone (which also was around).normally i'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show, but they just didn't fully work here. some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network, like the episode "ghost train", which was directed by spielberg himself. in that episode, it gave the message of hope, and gave us a fantasy story, but overall it was just a build up to the ending which didn't blow me away anyways. the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama, but there were far more dramatic ones, and they grow tiring to watch. acting wise, this anthology got some big stars, similar to the original twilight zone. kevin costner, kiefer sutherland, milton berle, dom deluise, harvey keitel, beau bridges, charlie sheen, forrest whitaker, tim robbins, john lithgow, rhea perlman, danny devito, patrick swayze, christopher lloyd, june lockhart, kathy baker, weird al yankovich and many other well knowns have been in episodes of the show. it's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series. great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself, clint eastwood, burt reynolds, bob clark, joe dante, mick garris, paul bartel, joe dante, robert zemeckis, danny devito and even martin scorsese. i'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and/or the 80s than anyone else.amazing stories was sometimes amazing, usually good, occasionally mediocre, and every once in a while a real stinker came out. but, this show has nostalgic value to me, and it's sort of fun to sit on boring afternoons and watch some episodes. john williams' theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone's head who watches this, too.my rating: good show. 30 mins. per episode. tvpg

to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life, does it have a meaning? - is sheer impossible. of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness. this happens if the input from the senses overrules the "input" from our mind, i.e. our thoughts. few directors know how to communicate essential things. tarkovsky, is one. his "stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind. i think de zee and de graaff do the same.

this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy. he examines the ever illusive question of 'who am i' and 'what is i?' it's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise. there is a shipload of beautiful images, dream-inspired, escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the hand drawing itself, or rather, erasing itself. more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film, we see him phoning with his wife who left for peru, leaving him to take care of their baby, a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his dilemma's that he hardly looks at the child anymore. his wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helping him go over the last treshold until he erases him-self. interspersed with eye-pleasing and i-destructing images, the story is mainly philosophical. it's about the veils of maya, the world of illusion. the paradox of the movie however, is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid philosophising the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie. if that was the purpose of the maker, he succeeded quite well.

one is tempted to define the genre of gert de graaff's movie as `event of the thought' following the example of merab mamardashvili. the nominal storyline is a certain bart klever's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality. the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. this film-monologue originated as a response to fellini's `8 ½' and cost gert de graaff 13 years of work. excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience, it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary, the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies: that of guttenberg and that of maclhuen. for some time we are apt to side with the script writer, who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality (`man', `catholic', `window washer'). and together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma: how can one eliminate from the future movie. bart klever? just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator, who is deeply immersed in work, we realize that together with the main character we have again been `framed'. really, what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter?so who is he, this bart klever? is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like frenhoffer from balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written)? gert de graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves.

after going for a bike ride that day, lying beside a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it, this film made absolute sense to me.the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need. switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done.reminded me of baraka (1992) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph.this comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten. after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment.

the plot doesn't begin to describe the film: a man is writing a film, or rather, *this* film. it's totally self referential to the point that you think it's going to fold in on itself like a black hole. the writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it.it's very philosophical, like "waking life" but more zen oriented and for that matter, much better, in my opinion. at one point there are person-on-the-street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed, and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines. there is beautiful scenery and optical illusions.i hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully. seen at cinequest (the san jose, ca film festival) on 2/25/2002.

this stylistically sophisticated visual game presents a story within a story'. the protagonist is scriptwriter bart klever who fights persistently with his new text  which is, at the same time, the screenplay of the film we're watching. in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film bart's struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl. the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space, light, colours and a couple of cats. the outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker's interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment. the constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise: what is truth' and what illusion' ? which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space?

we all create our own reality, or do we? that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m.c. escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `who are we and what is our place in the universe?', and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. the film centers on bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `the sea that thinks.' as he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. ultimately, de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses. note: after you've seen the movie, check out the film's entertaining web site.

i can remember watching this for the first time, when i was 9 years old. i wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". this movie is still great. one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short. implying that the "barbarian brothers" where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly! plus, you have chases, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes even a bar brawl! yes, the acting is bad so that's why it's not a ten, also the story line has received a lot of criticism. i think it is quite original. not to many movies in it's genre have the same original story lines, or colorful dialogue. i definitely recommend this film.

well, some people would say that this particular movie stinks...but hey! thats not right, not right at al...the movie may not have the best special effects, and may not have the best actors (except the exelence of the barbarian bros.) dispite theese minor fact, i can honostly say that this is one of the funniest movies i´ve ever seen, and i´ve seen em al!

apparently ruggero deodato figured out, early on, that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously, so he decided to camp it up. the result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy! and i think i'll go the second way. the brief gore moments are well-done, the paul brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in one scene!), and there is also a charming, spirited, good-natured performance by eva la rue, as the girl who tags along with the "boys". plus, where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque?? (***)

the barbarians maybe´s not the best film that anybody of us have seen, but really????........it´s so funny......i can´t discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw it..the director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but it´sso misirable bad....so bad that it´s one of the funniest movies i´ve ever seen......so my advise is that you should see it.....and if you alredy did, se it again!!!!!!!

i love bad movies. not only, because they often are as entertaining as 'really' 'good' films (like pirates of the caribbean series and other hollywood pathos), but they often are far better than those films. and that's the reason why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s. and that's the reason why i especially love this movie, the barbarians & the company.director ruggero deodato has made some actually very good movies, like house on the edge of the park, and also his atlantis interceptors and live like a cop, die like a man are enjoyable action movies. but this is really bad. the barbarians is so idiotic movie. peter and david paul as the barbarian brothers kutchek and gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. but if they can't act, they yell and scream every time they do something important. in one scene people try to hang the barbarian brothers, and they escape very extraordinary way.bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, actually everything is bad in this movie. i can't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time. the barbarians & the company is camp classic everybody should see once. if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp, this will be a real killer.

this movie maybe really bad, but it is alot of fun. the bad acting and poor direction enhance the film's hystericalness. the twins are very funny in their conanesque roles. if you go into this film expecting the first conan or excalibur, than you will hate it. if you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good, dumb fun you will have a good time. watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers, its funniest scene in the film. i wish mystery science theatre 3000 would have done this!!

as shallow as it may sound, i actually delayed my viewing of "the barbarians" several times just because the vhs cover (as well as the picture image displayed here on the website) looks so incredibly gay! by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay. just trashy, cheesy, campy and enormously fun! it's almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato, director of "cannibal holocaust" of all people, was the man responsible for this comical cash-in on the contemporary popular sword & sandal fantasy flicks, particularly schwarzenegger's conan movies. the film opens with a terrific 'once-upon-a-time' type of off-screen narrator, introducing us to the ragneks. their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers. in other words, the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks! their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks' beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby. meanwhile, and as some sort of amusing waste of time, the two orphan twin-brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death. instead of that, however, they escape and develop a plan to free their queen. actually, the plot isn't half as bad as i initially feared, but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers' on screen chemistry, the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy-monsters, like a dragon with adorably cute eyes, some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp. the soundtrack and make-up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace. the barbarian brother's acting capacities are much better than i anticipated, apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds. the supportive cast is splendid as well. eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara, virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut-shaped hair style (i kid you not!). last but not least, "the barbarians" stars everybody's favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster. i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people, but "the barbarians" really is a must-see italian exploitation highlight.

deodato brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. absolutely a classic in it's own particular kind of way. this movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarians. if you get a chance to see this movie do so. you'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time. not because it's funny or anything mundane like that but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good, though maybe not clean, fun.

this was directed by ruggero deodato, a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious cannibal holocaust. however, don't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a conan inspired outing for a young audience.such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole conan inspired sword & sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this, it has to be said, this movie is just so much fun!it's mostly played for laughs and features two huge and highly likable heroes in the form of david and peter paul aka. the barbarian brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters.b-movie favourite richard lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for big george eastman and michael berryman.added to this, the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration (a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre!)what can i say, - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and i recommend it wholeheartedly!

yes, i loved this movie when i was a kid. when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out.my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system. at first, my mom wasn't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it.like i said, this movie is every little boys dream the movie contains a terrific setting, big muscled barbarians, beautiful topless women, big bad monsters and jokes you'll only get when you get older. so, a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time. at first, i was bored, then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid, and continued watching. yeah, the experience wasn't as great as i remembered the acting is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes weren't funny anymore, but the women were still pretty. yes, i've grown up. even though the movie experience has changed for me, i still think it's worth 7 stars. for the good old times you know

this film was great.the plot was preposterous.the action sequences contrived.but, provided you can lighten up enough to laugh, it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger.the baddies were more silly than bad. the good guys weren't too good. the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes.the inclusion of a baby added a good touch. sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise. i have to disagree about the acting. it was, on the whole, very good. i really wanted to punch judge reinhold.and, after all, isn't that the mark of a really good movie, wanting to punch judge reinhold?

i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies/language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the microphone on the water barrel part =d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas/coffee/phone/play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid -_- i think i'm done never mind i'm still not done what is this a joke? why do we have to go all the way to line ten... really what's the point of it??!! i will just right random words for now -_- maple story is fun i love my friends

just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour. i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end. there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone. it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error. the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet (hood) and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on. it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn't going to be lowered and then it was. i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn't that bad!!!!

in light of bad reviews - or car crashes - i feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due, and do a service. i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad, almost automatically.it's rare for a movie to have suspense. this movie maintained suspense it's whole length, for me, despite any flaws that may be. how many films can say that? not even many big ones. because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie. yeh, the suspension was tight, and over some bumps the shocks did their work. it's not just a tv movie, but an all-action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates, or becomes talky. it would be hard to make a film like this, always on the road. only duel, or speed, are this that i recall. the best thing in them also was the constant tension.acting is not bad: the judge is as good as ever, and the others are. script is good. but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry. what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. your first judgments are not always right, but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie.stunts are mostly terrific, especially for a tv movie. their only failing may be the noticeable, and again, apparent, slow speed. but we all know how deceivingly slow grand prix cars can look.i liked that the beginning said, "inspired by a true story." so you are not going to go how much is true? you know just the basis is. the usual "based on a true story" makes me think it should mostly be true. but maybe that's my error.how to save them: good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up. just a few inches would do. a stunt driver could do that at 100 mph. odd that they didn't call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there's a way.i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster. or at least neutral. and help it become a runaway success.pic quality is a little soft for a dvd.spoiler: they would have been winched out after the baby was, but strangely that life-saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out. i guess we know why. end of movie. suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby.

how this has not become a cult film i do not know. i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!"runaway car" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good god it's bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. and laugh you will. films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth. this film is the pinnacle in entertainment, i laughed from beginning to end. at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces, i was laughing hysterically. but when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face.it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's "like a prayer" video. he seems to get everywhere.

look, although we don't like to admit it, we've all have to suppress our fears concerning the extreme likelihood of experiencing the events that take place in this movie. you know: you get into your car and you immediately start thinking,"gosh, i hope today isn't the day that my accelerator sticks at a comfortable cruising speed of 55 mph, all four door latches break in the locked position, both my main and emergency brake fail, my ignition switch can't be turned off, and i've got a full tank of gas; all simultaneously." fortunately, for most of us, our thorazine kicks-in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car. not so for the makers of the harrowing, white-knuckle, edge-of-your-seat (if only in preparation to leave the room) action juggernaut, "runaway car" but they go ahead and drive anyway!i am endlessly pleased to have found (thanks to the imdb) that this movie is real, and that i didn't merely dream it.this movie is, at the very least, one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el dorado of very bad cinema.i highly recommend it.

this movie is the next segment in the pokemon movies which supplies everything on hopes and dreams of a pokemon warrior named ash ketchim and his friends. they go out and they look battle and run into new pokemon and take on new adventures with pikachu and other pokemon favorites. this adventure takes on with a new pokemon called celebi a time pokemon. go join ash brock and misty to find all sorts of new things!

whoever says pokemon is stupid can die. this movie is superlative. i even shead a tear when celebei died. i don't cry much! this film is a touching animated thriller. in this fourth installment of pokemon, ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. in the time, sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters. i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball (if you've played pokemon gold, silver, or crystal, you know what it is.)i also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brothers. putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea. the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever.

my brother and i have pokemon 4ever on dvd. we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best. too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time. i'll get used to it.the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball. good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control.there was only one song in the ending credits called cele-b-r-a-t-e performed by russell velazquez.pokemon 4ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film.

the 4th pokemon movie made me cry when celebi died. don't you dare say that pokemon sucks! i don't like it when people say that.... i've liked pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy pokemon, including this movie and other pokemon movies. so, without further ado, please say that pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages. and also, why do pokemon-haters give low ratings for all or most of the pokemon movies? i don't understand.... they shouldn't do that.... there's absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that pokemon sucks besides the fact that: 1) pokemon is for little kids only. 2) pokemon is stupid. and 3) people shouldn't like pokemon. i think this is why people don't like pokemon.

i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies. yes, i know, all of them are very corny, mediocre in some certain areas and sure, even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement,"hey, lighten up, it's a kids movie," but all that aside, aren't they still good pieces of entertainment? in my opinion, they are so and i enjoy them greatly. this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and certainly cuter. it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable, fresh pokemon celebi. it's not the best pokemon movie, but i do enjoy it more than the third installment, even though the third is not bad, and the entire series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more, nothing less. this film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially around the climax/ending, as do all the installments, and the characters, while a bit more lackluster than the previous three, i thought, are still likable and humorous. this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length adaptions, and it doesn't deserve that.

out of these pokemon films (which are in order of best to least for me): pokemon the first movie, pokemon 4ever, pokemon heroes, pokemon 200 and pokemon: entei and the unknown, this is probably the one most concerning the environment, arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one. whether these are good points for you or not, "pokemon 4ever," still has entertained many.as well as the three points covered above, this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi (as well as anime). the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket (the comic reliefs/rubbish baddies) end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks. the flaws are, as always, the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting, even more so than a few pokemon film baddies. a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest. a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere...meanwhile, ash, brock and misty are entering a large forest...curious? watch the rest...good for all pokemon fans and "american" anime movie fans, enjoy "pokemon 4ever"! :-)

i so love this movie! the animation is great (for a pokémon movie), the cgi looks so awesome. i love the music in the movie. so great they kept the japanese music.as for the story: its great. it has a great feeling of friendship. celebi is a very cute and powerful pokémon. ash is really great in this movie, and i like his friendship with sam. the only thing i didn't like was suicune's appearance, he just suddenly pops up, helps ash & co a bit and leaves. they could have made his part in the movie a little bigger.but overall, awesome movie! can't wait to own the usa version on dvd!

another pokemon movie has hit the theaters, and again, i'm hearing the same old, "pokemon is dead, blah blah blah." the franchise's detractors couldn't be more wrong. kids are still playing the trading card game, they're still watching the tv series, they're waiting for the game boy advance games, and they want to see "pokemon the 4th movie."that said, "pokemon the 4th movie" introduces us to two more "legendary" pokemon: suicune, the "north wind" of lore, and celebi, guardian of the forest (and star of the show). celebi transports itself and a boy named sam 40 years into the future, to the present day, where pokemon trainer ash, his faithful pikachu, and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto. sam and ash become fast friends, once they discover the other's mutual love for pokemon (sam's vintage pokeball with screw-on top is a great moment). together, they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story, the team rocket agent aptly named vicious, who is hell-bent on capturing celebi for his own ends. will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious' dark balls? where does suicune fit into the picture? will jessie, james, and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before? and just who is sam, really?like with the first 3 movies, if you go into the movie deciding that you're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it's pokemon (or just because your child/niece/nephew/younger sibling/et cetera "dragged" you into it), then you're going to hate it because you've decided that you want to hate it. that may be, but to blindly trash "pokemon the 4th movie" simply because it is a pokemon movie, and especially without having seen it, is just plain stupid. even non-fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon. i'm not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie, but you can indeed enjoy it, if you'll let yourself.unlike the first 3 pokemon movies, "pokemon the 4th movie" is being distributed by miramax, who i've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th pokemon movie, which was released this past summer in japan. miramax claims to have some boffo-aggressive marketing strategy for "pokemon the 4th movie," but all i've seen so far is a feeble limited release, which doesn't include the usual pikachu short in the beginning, which i was really looking forward to this time. i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short, called "pikachu's exciting hide-and-seek," onto at least the dvd/vhs release, if not with a future wider release of "pokemon the 4th movie." i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film.

i can't see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm, when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about. this is a fun movie. my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it. granted, the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher, but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark, gloomy, and very morbid pokemon 3. my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will "put off the childish things" and move on to others. i am glad that we got to enjoy this together.

as a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much. it introduces new legendary pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy it(this includes most adults). some of the lines were corny, but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english. the animation was beautiful, although there were a couple parts that did not look good. and although the villain is kind of corny, i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains, and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one. those who did not like it, i say to each his own, but pokémon fans will love it.

the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies, what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery, the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times. while most of these were rip-roaring swashbucklers about the wild, superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like errol flynn and tyrone power, gunga din is very different in its focus, scope and tone.part of gunga din's secret is the division of labour in its writing team. the original story is by ben hecht and charles macarthur, two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood's golden age. however the actual screenplay was the work of joel sayre and fred guiol, both of whom, guiol especially, had a background in comedy. what we get from these four is a plot that is well-balanced and engaging, yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches. most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies, usually featuring one or two comic-relief supporting players, but they didn't use laughs in the way gunga din does. here, all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes. we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light-hearted brawl. the first main battle scene is an even-handed blend of action and gags, in the style of the silent swashbucklers of douglas fairbanks, sr., something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to replicate. towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot. however the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this "slow" portion bearable.producer-director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point. this was his first full-on action feature, and he does a startlingly good job. in particular his use of moving point-of-view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating. he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era  a sense of real dread and fear. he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters. the portrayal of the abandoned village and the thuggee cultists cry of "kali!" is genuinely haunting. this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here, causing us to worry for these likable characters, and making the comedy a greater relief of tension.a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience. we are made aware of din visually, as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him. because of this, we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the regiment, but he quickly becomes a notable character to us, and crucially a sympathetic one, as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men.but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast. fear not, for gunga din has a top-notch one! victor mclaglan and cary grant were ideally suited to the material, since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy. grant in particular is at his best, largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over-the-top whooping and capering that was his trademark. douglas fairbanks, jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions, but he is by no means bad. and of course there is sam jaffe, cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs, but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity? i have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of errol flynn and tyrone power, and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely. but gunga din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve. not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel, it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy, in a way that few pictures have done before or since. and that's fabulous.

this happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler, based rather loosely on rudyard kipling's memorable poem as well as his novel "soldiers three," qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s. cary grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. set in faraway india, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din (sam jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee. sergeant archibald cutter (cary grant of "the last outpost"), sergeant macchesney (oscar-winner victor mclaglen of "the informer"), and sergeant ballantine (douglas fairbanks, jr. of "the dawn patrol"), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins (joan fontaine) and enter the tea business. naturally, cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentine's plans. when their superiors order them back into action with sgt. bertie higginbotham (robert coote of "the sheik steps out"), cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him. half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves. director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees. lenser joseph h. august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.

early hollywood at it's best!! a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast. i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it. i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and, admit it, you do too!!

i only saw it once. this happened in 1952, i was seven, the movie 13.we were so young... but i kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of gunga's sacrifice.i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation. under these historical circumstances, in the movie, the personal relation of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, the one raised between people who share daily life, who see each other faces, who knows each other names, but belong to different worlds, can only make appears. then, in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges: "whom are we, in first, supposed to be loyal?", which people, family, motherland, the person you know close to you?. you do not have time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there, and it is for life or death. gunga-din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself. somewhere, in a confuse manner, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life i lived it, i shared with my child unconditional friendship. it was lived by the spectator i was. that day i loose gunga-din for ever. as i left behind, later, my pretty childhood, as i left from then so many worlds i lived in. i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up.

this movie had it all,action,comedy,heroics,and best of all some of the finest actors.gunga din will remain a classic to be enjoyed by all who like good movies.excellent picture,i have it in my collection.

cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclaglen are three soldiers in 19th century india who, with the help of a water boy (sam jaffe) rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult. the chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time. sam jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem. a must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.

this is a ripsnorting, old-fashioned adventure yarn. i understand that by today's political standards, the treatment of the indians was unacceptable. but this moving isn't about politics. it's about action, dialogue, comradery, acting, direction, music, and photography, and it's marvelous on all these factors. grant, fairbanks, and mclaglen are electric together, and jaffe is superb. this is the ultimate buddy movie.

the film is based on kipling's heroic lines that inspire hollywood's biggest movie 1939.out of the drumbeat rhythm of kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year.big on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples thugs and mystic mountains of india .the picture is bigger still in its scope and sweep,is thrill and action but biggest biggest of all in the life breathes through three(gary grant,victor mclagen and douglas fairbanks jr) roaring,reckless,swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure,it's a honest film of it all that makes gunga din a new experience in entertainment .joan fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three.the romance between fontaine and fairbanks jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen. the motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show.it's a fabulous,furious and far-flung adventure with the red-blood and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of india and storm the screen with the lusty,rousing,robust life-thunder of men who fight for the love of it and love for the fun of it.the pictures is interpreted for the brave and roguish gary grant who rounded hundred villains thugs and the mean guru(eduardo ciannelli), grant shouts : you're under arrest!.besides is the heroic water man,sam jaffe,who regiment colonel(montagu love) says of him : you're a better man than i am,gunga din!

" now in india's sunny 'clime, where i use to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her majesty the queen . . . " so goes the famous poem penned by rudyard kipling. this is the literal foundation upon which the movie "gunga din" is based. if you are fortunate enough to watch this legendary classic, you will enjoy films the way they use to make them; for the sheer pleasure. taken from the script of the established novelist and poet, this is a story of a humble indian native named gunga din (sam jaffe) who works as 'a regimental beasty' during the british occupation of india during the 18th century. his greatest wish is to become a soldier. the water boy is part of a british calvary contingent threatened with death by a notorious blood cult of kali called the 'thuggee.' three particular soldiers stand out in this company who are noted for their bravery and comradeship. first is handsome and debonair, cary grant playing sgt. archibald cutter. next is victor mclaglen as courageous sgt. macchesney and finally there's flamboyant douglas fairbanks jr. as sgt. thomas ballantine. all three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a hoard of mountain stranglers led by their fanatical leader called the 'guru' (eduardo ciannelli). amid the chaos of war, is the brave water-boy who hopes to earn a place in the army by playing a bugle he found. a solid story for an old black and white film which needs little fanfare for anyone looking to enjoy a classic. ****

the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film "gunga din." based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclagen. the title role is played by sam jaffe, well known in my era as ben casey's boss, dr. zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. say "dr. zorba hair" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about.set in india at the time of the british occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, dashing figures in grant and fairbanks, and mclagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality, three overgrown boys. gunga din is the water carrier, treated somewhat meanly - verbally, anyway - by mcchesney (mclaglen), but cutter (grant) is fond of him. when he catches din (pronounced deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers, cutter gives him a few pointers.the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine (fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (joan fontaine) and leaving the service. however, when gunga din and cutter run across thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (eduardo cianelli), gunga din escapes to warn the unit, and ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save cutter. it's a buddy movie after all."gunga din" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by cary grant, who is quite funny. both he and fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. in the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, thrilling battle.grant has the showiest role, fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and mclaglen as mcchesney, mostly due to his treatment of gunga din, is the most unlikeable character, although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie. his softness comes through toward the end of the movie, particularly in the very touching, tear-jerking final scene.always a gentle and likable actor, sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. without much dialogue, jaffe conveys gunga din's soul magnificently.this is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. another one from that remarkable year, 1939. highly recommended.

gunga din (1939) is based on rudyard kipling's poem.the movie is directed by george stevens.it's set in india during the 19th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult.gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.the three leading men are brilliant.cary grant is sgt.archibald cutter, victor mclaglen is sgt.'mac' macchesney and douglas fairbanks jr.(the son of the legendary you know who) is sgt.thomas ballantine.let's not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way.the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline stebbins.it's awfully fun to watch the difficulties of tommy's and emmy's wedding plans.gunga din is awfully lot of fun.it can be funny, it can be thrilling.it can be everything a good movie requires.

"gunga din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly "water-bearer" named gunga din, a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts; three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism. their's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other. gunga din longs to be a soldier too, a bugler in particular, but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing. however, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle, but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks?...."you're a better man than i am, gunga din"! one of hollywood's classics and a perfect 10!!!!

this- and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera-was the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year, 1939.i will not not restate the obvious-cary grant,victor mclaglen( who was a bengal lancer), and douglas fairbanks jr. give superb comic performances.however, i want to note two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. the magnificent final battle sequence, as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply grand. it never fails to enthrall me. yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli's performance as the guru. this is no fu manchu caricature, but an well drawn, articulate, historically informed ( "have you ever heard of changruputra maurya?he defeated the armies left in india by alexander the great")villain. indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( a german, not an indian). gunga din, anti-nazi tract? not quite. but still, a tremendous, funny, moving epic.

its about time that gunga din is released on dvd. i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but, i never tire of it. the lead actors worked so well together. victor mclaglen (sgt mcchesney), cary grant (sgt cutter) and douglas fairbanks jr (sgt ballentine) are an unbeatable team.i just cannot get over their exploits in india. your first glimpse at the sergeants three, is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think.they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few "residents" in hiding. soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base.later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din. they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters. din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured. soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din, and they are too captured.faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them. the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush. in doing this, din is shot dead.the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. at the end, din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army.

three sergeants in the british army stationed in india, are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the thuggees. one of the sergeants, cutter, leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the thuggees lead by the sinister guru. gunga din, the regiment's water boy, goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him, but are also captured. now the major sends a full detail out after the three, but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the thugees. it is though, gunga din who saves the day. excellently made buddy film, even though it is today politically incorrect. grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with jaffe very well in the title role and cianelli very sinister as guru. rating- 10 out of 10.

my favorite "imperialism" movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time. grant, mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most "pc" of film goers. memorable scenes abound -- the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs; macchesney & cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch ("save some for the elephant"); cutter to macchesney -- "i'm an expedition"; din breaking cutter out of jail, with a fork ("what do you think i'm trying to break out of? a bleedin' pudding?!) and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing, bold as brass -- "all right, you're all under arrest!"i could go on, but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on. for armchair adventurers and generals, it's hard to imagine a better 2 hours.

i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention, what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroism,bravery and the honor to have served in her majestys service.this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be,however i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgt.cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group.to be certain sgt. cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of england.i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great.a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear.i think grant was excellent in this role,truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore.i never felt ballantine was a shoe-in ,in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture.what do i mean?this picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention.both ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majesty.these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful,even enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene.is it believable?i don't know.i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service,and getting married and going into the tea business.machesney says he could sign up for another 9 years.it will make a man out of him.i like that sentiment.i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests.where does this end,in fact it may never end.those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old.i had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kali.there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kali,this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence.this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted.i think this is an excellent film.george stevens directed.there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr.kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kipling?george stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred.the information is honest,compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din.there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned.sgt.cutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restrained.din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril.with a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple.the sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned.a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified.it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows,sgt.cutter says good work soldier.i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril.the end is far from being anti-climatic,it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed.ballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time.the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense.machesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal.this is a very sober point and then he comes to din.now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead.the poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men.gunga din bravo!

of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers, charge of the light brigade for example, this movie stands out as the cream of the crop. it reflects a time when "the sun never set on the british empire." get over it. i won't go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great. i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals. and even though i know it's coming, seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read "yes, din! din! din!you lazarushian-leather gunga din!though i've belted you and flayed you,by the livin' gawd that made you,you're a better man than i am, gunga din" i still, at 54 years of age, get misty eyed and anyone who says they don't is a liar. the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie. like the ending of another great film, of mice and men.

i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i can't help but be entertained by it. gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made "monsters" to carry a scene. the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant, victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr. is suberb and very entertaining to watch. the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly. some might consider it "corny" but i consider it "classic" filmaking and acting at its best. one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil. gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades. in short, its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either.

....rather well done, actually--attack the evil villains in their lair, stop a little big horn style ambush, save the day via the waterboys' bugling, works for me. stiff upper british lip and all that.so how does it play on a dvd 66 years later? struck me as being like a western, subbing apaches or sioux for the thugs, and the us cavalry for the imperial british army. it's very colonial in it's outlook, you know? white man's burden and all that? kipling certainly would have approved.cary grant, fairbanks and maclaglen play it as broadly as possible, putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure. (i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife--did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor? very short-) none of them were aiming for an oscar here--in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes--but sod it, it still works. and where else would ben casey wind up as an indian bugler? only in hollywood.def. check this out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style antics. it was done by a bunch of pros, well i might add.*** outta ****

this movie is one of my all time favorites. cary grant, victor mclaglen, and douglas fairbanks jr...what a cast. not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din. drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up into one. the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears. if you haven't seen it, i'd strongly recommend it.

the film was shot at movie flats, just off route 395, near lone pine, california, north of the road to whitney portals. you can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built. and you'll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie.i won't bother with the plot, since i'm sure it's covered elsewhere. the movie stars three athletes -- fairbanks fils, who must have learned a good deal from his dad -- grant, an acrobat in his youth -- and maclaughlin, a professional boxer from south africa. their physical skills are all on display.not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously. it's about thugees, a sect in india, whence our english word "thug." i can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director, george stevens, was a polymath with a background in laurel and hardy movies -- see his choreography of the fight scenes -- and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of shane and the diary of anne frank. dynasties rose and fell. geological epochs came and went, while liz taylor and monty clift kissed in "a place in the sun." here, in his comic mode, he excels.this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy -- too easy -- to read homoeroticism into it, as many people do with howard hawks. or hatred of women. but it isn't that at all. sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention. men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (women share secrets.) read deborah tannen, nobody's idea of an anti-feminist. well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. for most of human history -- about nine tenths of it -- hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather. hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. men who were not very good at bonding were darwinianed out, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. and grant, fairbanks, and maclaughlin have got it in spades.sorry to ramble on about evolution but i'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. did i ever tell you about the horse in vaitongi, samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me? you've got to watch the hooves.joan fontaine is lovely, really. only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies. i lived in saratoga, california, where her sister, olivia dehavilland, grew up and went to a convent school. pretty place.if you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the british empahh at its height, you should never forgive yourself. it's so famous that it's parodied in the peter sellers movie, "the party." yes -- the colonel's got to know.

i saw this picture in 1940 for $.11 and i would like to secure a dvd in 2006 the film was the greatest adventure of the time and,like all epics,is still an entertainment marvel (b&w and all)you get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe & eduardo cianelli are outstanding (this could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of kipling's poem over the body of gunga din and tells the "untouchable" "you're a better man than i am gunga din"they don't make movies of this character today.the only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine

for years i thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of john ford, especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads. it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford laces his films with. to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it. still i refuse to believe that this film wasn't offered to john ford, but he was probably off in monument valley making stagecoach.victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks, jr., play three sergeants in the indian army who have a nice buddy/buddy/buddy camaraderie going. but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine. not if his two pals can help it, aided and abetted by regimental beastie gunga din as played by sam jaffe.the rudyard kipling poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about barracks life in the british raj. the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film. not that the makers were racist, but this was the assumption of the british there at the time, including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively.the british took india by increments, making deals here and there with local rulers under a weak mogul emperor who was done away with in the middle of the 19th century. they ruled very little of india outright, that would have been impossible. their rule depended on the native troops you see here. note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that.note here that the rebels in fact are hindu, not moslem. there are as many strains of that religion as there are christian sects and this strangling cult was quite real. of course to those being strangled they might not have the same view of them as liberators. but until india organized its independence movement, until the congress party came into being, these people were the voice of a free india.but however you slice it, strangling people isn't a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also. when i watch gunga din, i think of star trek and the reason the prime directive came into being.cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the urbane cary we're used to seeing. fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities.best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru, the head of the strangler cult. note the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on.favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troops in their mountain temple. note how stevens progressively darkens the background around ciannelli until all you see are eyes and teeth like a ghoulish halloween mask. haunting, frightening and very effective.it was right after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying assumptions justifying the raj. but that's the subject of gandhi.gunga din is still a great film, entertaining and funny. it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can chart how the indian independence movement evolved.

pandro s. berman was "in charge of production" but that made him the so-called line producer. but who produced this epic, filmed not in arizona but in california's mohave desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the "gold temple", the thuggee huts, the british outpost at muri, the village of tantrapur, etc. the minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. what's unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music, although maybe the academy didn't offer such at the time. a single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. brilliant! one of the curious aspects of the production was the widow kipling's demands. an actor playing kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. in the initial release his scenes were cut, per mrs. kipling's demands. later they were included and lent a "connection" of kipling's immortal poem to ben hecht's screenplay. interestingly, this very typically and pro-british story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the british.

a rousing adventure form director george stevens (before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same, gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india. the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades, and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger-inspired space opera star wars (1977) to the similarly-plotted raiders of the lost arc (1981).the biggest reason for the picture's success, however, is the pitch-perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors. victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy, cary grant is the ultimate comic foil, and douglas fairbanks, jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn. the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon, and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength. a huge hit in its day (the film was reportedly the second-biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind), and it remains arguably the best film of its kind.

obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din. the characters that grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo, luke skywalker, and chewbacca. even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c-3po and r2-d2 and like him or not: jar jar binks.today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today. to a young boy this was a great film. three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush. not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. too late to lament lost innocence.hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action, adventure, and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors.

a trio of buddies, sergeants all in the british army, carouse & brawl their way across imperial india. intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier gunga din, to save scores of the queen's soldiers from certain massacre.based more on the three musketeers than kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in hollywood's golden year of 1939. filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, cary grant, victor mclaglen & douglas fairbanks jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. however, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.(it's interesting to note, parenthetically, that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career; fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence, keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers.)the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of kipling's poem ring true. he is unforgettable.montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru. the rest of the cast, joan fontaine, robert coote, lumsden hare, are effective but have little to do. movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine's father.the film picks its villains well. the demonic thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked kali, hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. in 1840 the british military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion. henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares.

anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black & white movies should put this on their television set. when the child walks by, wondering what all the on screen shouting and shooting's about, tell him this is a picture for adults and that he isn't big enough to watch it yet. that'll hold him there for a few minutes; director george stevens and his team will keep him to the end.i think my father did that to me, anyway, and i'm the better man for it. this classic adventure yarn, set in india during the british occupation, features a trio of army sergeants who find their tight union facing dissolution as one prepares to marry his sweetheart. help arrives in the form of a vicious thuggie revolt that the soldiers find themselves united against."gunga din" was one of the great movies to come out of hollywood's finest year, 1939. even more than most great movies from that golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. the theme music is instant hummable nirvana. while shot in california, the camera work (the only thing in "gunga din" that got so much as an oscar nomination) has a windblown grandeur that feels very much like the raj of a hundred years before. the battle scenes are shot in a very realistic manner, not too violent but very messy as people fall and shoot and run in all corners of each frame in a way that feels real, not staged like some cecil b. demille biblical slaughter fest.the script doesn't just set up action scenes, it also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great dollops of humor. the main focus is on sgt. cutter, chasing after tall tales of golden treasures. it's a rare actioner for cary grant, and his lightness is just right for a film that never takes itself seriously even as it develops taut suspense.anchoring the trio is sgt. macchesney (victor mclaglen), who dotes over his elephant annie and tries to protect cutter from his own hare-brained schemes. he's just as funny in his own way, leaving sgt. ballantine (douglas fairbanks jr., displaying some nice errol flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and grounding enough to know he needs to chuck his boyish pals and grow up.if "gunga din" was a lifetime movie, it would be about joan fontaine's efforts to save her man from his two loser friends and their skull crushing hijinks. but since it's a guys' film, the accent here is on how the threesome must stay together and save ballantine from a fate worse than death, not only marriage, but as cutter indignantly exclaims several times, the tea business, too.the political correctness police are hard on this film, not so much for the gender issue but the idea of british soldiers saving poor indians from the vicious thuggies. it reeks of colonial apologia. thankfully, this film was made back when, and the producers thus felt no need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, so full of derring-do and false racial pride, have to be saved along with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only one of the three had any time for when he sought their approval. after all, for all their swashbuckling glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, played so heart-wrenchingly by sam jaffe.back when this film was made, movie mogul jack warner had a saying: you want to send a message, use western union. still, it seems like the messages were flying fast and furious in "gunga din." i watch the film now and wonder if audiences back then were meant to wonder what gunga din was really up to when he led cutter to the golden temple. was he really plotting revenge against his british overlords? would he have been justified in doing so, especially given macchesney's cold treatment of him? when col. weed delivers that eulogy, the poem by rudyard kipling on which the film is loosely based, was it with a nod in the direction of imperialism's folly, of lording it over someone who proved "a better man than i am" in the end? what did they make of the guru's great speech, delivered in perfect clipped english: "you have sworn an oath as soldiers to maybe die for a faith, which is your country, england. well, i can die for my country and my faith as readily as you...india, farewell."of course, the same character also instructs his brutal followers: "kill for the love of killing! kill for the love of kali! kill! kill! kill!" which means we are allowed to hate him and root for the british, and save the questions about what it all means for later.what "gunga din" means to me, most of all, is the quickest, surest 90-minute thrill ride on video. cutter never found his golden temple, but there's one for all of us watching "gunga din."

there's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart. having just said goodbye to my new fiancée - of oh...one day - for an unknown period of time, i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see.i watched a few movies and tv shows, but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i haven't seen. for that, i have this movie to thank.being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand, i was sure i was going to like it anyway. but i didn't just like it, i loved it.the technical mastery is astounding. how did they do it? how did they capture the animals in the way they did?? it's just wonderful.the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous, it's a happy/sad one. again, it caught me a bit off-guard. as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself, the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours! perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what i left.but for those few hours on the plane, i was happy to see something new and original. and that's life. sure, there are those things you love and feel comfortable around...but the great outdoors holds many a mystery. so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open; i'm going to explore it, observe it and embrace it. that's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie/nature doc too. 8/10 p.s. it's two months on from the plane journey. we still don't know when we'll see each other again, but we will.

this is a very beautiful and almost meditative film-there is hardly any dialogue in it, apart from the narration; and the scenery and music compliment each other perfectly. i didn't at first connect the red hair of the girl and the fox until it was pointed out to me by a friend (who also has red hair!) it is almost an old fashioned type of children's films, saying that children nowadays prefer animations like shrek or toy story etc-but i feel that young people should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature which this film certainly does. maybe not the best ever film of its type but certainly an excellent and relaxing view for all ages -not just children.

i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago. it came and went with little fanfare, but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage. (the story, while nice, is really incidental. if you actually thought about it, there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life.) i just saw it again tonight, here in the states, on dvd. again, i gather it has very limited distribution. blockbusters only had one copy of it, and i don't recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland.seen on my tv, the photography is not as breathtaking, though it is still very beautiful. the wildlife footage is still fascinating. the story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around, when you know where it's headed.still, as i said, the story is incidental. it's a beautiful film to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, you should find this fascinating.

a must see for anyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking,leaves you in ore. seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd. it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something else.took my two daughters to see this and they loved it, my oldest cried at the end.but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop. its simple telling of a child's love for nature and in particular a fox is told well. in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate. which works for children very well. not being preached to is very important, you make your own mind up.but the star of this film is the cinematographers, how did they do what they did. amazing just amazing.

watching "the fox and the child" was an intoxicating experience. the lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.the plot is uncomplicated. deceptively simple. within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.i laughed. i wept. i learned.this is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. it reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart.adi da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality. i feel i have been privileged to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of true art.

maybe i'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully done.i really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable, such as the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here). i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand.after reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused, one says that at the end -spoiler- the mother and her son appear, as she's been the one telling her son about her story. the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end, merely a painting of a girl with a fox. can someone enlighten me on that? anyway i really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through. still worth it if they can sit still.

from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins, i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child. from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france, the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale, which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters, renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it, played by bertille noel-beuneau.the story's frankly quite simple, and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust, and how they go about hanging around each other, dealing with respective adversaries and the likes. here, the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains, which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture.but while we indulge in wistful scenery, the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset, and we have to wait a few seasons to past, and 45 minutes into the film, before they find a leveler in food. the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement, but the fox, well, as other notions of course. while i thought the narrative was pretty weak, unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen, what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie, tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator, and a prey.between the two, more tension and drama was given to the latter, especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves, and granted, those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it. otherwise, it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other, in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing. there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children, as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly, so parents, you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers.as a film, i would've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins, but i guess the way it was resented, probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature, and that some things are just not meant to be, and should stay as such. decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel- bruneau, and the multiple foxes that played renard.

the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet. the movie, which boasts just one human being in its cast, young actress bertille noël-bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare, though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.part-nature documentary, and part-fairy tale, the film focuses on l'infant, the child, who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting, possibly france, though the exact location is never mentioned. over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox, who she begins to call lily, once again. and so it goes on. days turn to weeks, and then the summer disappears, turning to fall and then winter, promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping, white winter landscape. eventually, spring comes around again, and the young child finds her fox, and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal. and so on.i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child. i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film-making contained in that movie. luc jacquet is a hugely talented, and indeed rare film-maker, and i was expecting some superb, breathtaking cinematography, sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife. this was delivered in spades. but here jacquet has a screen writing credit, and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening, i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'march'. a fictional story.the child and the fox and the story is simple. a young, seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school, seemingly on her own, every day, seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world. without the hint of an adult in sight. brilliant. so she strikes up a friendship with a fox.with a film like this, you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience. this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of, i'd say, six and up. or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon. not a 31-year-old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent, brilliant wanted and the like. but, me being the newbie london critic, i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight-year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child. now, i have a few problems with this film. as a 31-year-old lad, and loyal lover of all things cinematic, i loved the wildlife and landscape photography. it's visually stunning. the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed -- as good as you will find on any of attenborough's efforts. as an impressionable, short attention spanning eight year old, i loved about the first half hour -- then i lost interest. it's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child, particularly the rather dark ending. as a 31-year-old male -- i was a little frightened in places. wuss.so, it's not a child's film. it's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down. is it a good family film. depends. it's educational maybe, and the film carries a message. it's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer. it's hard, but i know some will go see and fall in love this film. it's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks, give it a try. unsure? well i'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then. -- paul heath, http://www.thehollywoodnews.com, july 2008.

the very first image of the movie shows a mountain ridge in early morning autumn mist, and my thought was: "this is almost too beautiful." and it goes on like this: images of landscape and animals that look like a series of romantic paintings, each of them perfect in every detail. even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. this could seem outdated and escapistic, but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty, happening on the border between life and fairy tale, between dian fossey and le petit prince. i enjoyed every minute of it. the extreme parsimony of the movie, having a simple, slow story, just one actor and hardly any special effects, exerted a strong magic. i therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown-up woman, and her son) are introduced. another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate: i couldn't bring an english pop-song together with french mountain glory. i went to the movie together with my two small daughters, but i recommend it to adults as well, given that they appreciate this kind of movie. obviously, not everybody does.

what can i say about this movie? i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6. i have seen the english version and it is done very well. it is a great movie for all ages, but it is directed more for children. i love the childlike humor and appreciate it. if you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!

this movie was very good because it remember when i was young when i maked snow castle. it was so fun. this movie is interessant. this is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful.

***1/2 out of ***** while i am not concerned with the fact that this is an english dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, as it seems to reside in many quebecois native hearts. however, this was a movie as a child that i was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, i rate it on a relative basis. the story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort, and jostling back-'n-forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions, as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons. if i had children, this definitely is a film i would try and get them interested in, as the snow fort wowed me when i was young, and i think even children today would agree, albeit with pixar and all the computer animation, maybe i am out of date and just don't realize it. in addition, the movie's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that, for children (and adults alike).

i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight. i must have found the characters round, because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie. and the ending, now that's sad, well... for a 7-8 year old kid.i had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional... i guess it's the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child... pity...i recommend this one for all you parents with small kids... ( i saw it in its original french version, so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not.)

this is a pretty strange movie. it does comes across as an exploitation film with over-the-top violence and unrealistic situations, but unusual for being constructed around rural characters at war with each other, as opposed to an invading 'other'.the movie is an excessive stereotype of vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that portrayed the vets of that war as dangerous psycopaths. kris kristofferson's last line is 'i ain't lost a war yet', as he meets his demise after wreaking a long trail of murder and destruction, including the town's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly chilling scene. however, kristofferson is a good enough actor, and charismatic enough, to carry this villain with a surprising depth. vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity layered over his clean cut goodness. the movie bears some plot resemblance to winchester 73 where jimmy stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until being forced to act against him.the movie has b-movie grade action, though the presence of kristofferson, vincent, a gorgeous victoria principal and bernadette peters give it an a-grade lineup.i give it a 7 for being a long lost view into an american psyche of post-vietnam/pre-reagan introspection, paranoia, and confusion, and a movie industry that was willing to address such topics at that time.seen on the this channel, a great network that keeps playing lots of old movies of the 70s through 90s, regardless of political bent.

anarchy and lawlessness reign supreme in the podunk hick hamlet of elk hills. the town elders deputize tough, cagey vietnam veteran aaron (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by kris kristofferson) and several of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the place. the plan goes sour when aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over elk hills after they get rid of all the bad elements. it's up to aaron's decent do-gooder brother ben (amiably played by jan-michael vincent) to put a stop to him before things get too out of hand. writer/director george ("miami blues," "gross pointe blank") armitage whips up a delightfully amoral, cynical and wickedly subversive redneck drive-in exploitation contemporary western winner: he expertly creates a gritty, no-nonsense tone, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and stages the plentiful action scenes with considerable muscular aplomb (the rousing explosive climax is especially strong and stirring). the first-rate cast of familiar b-feature faces constitutes as a major asset: victoria principal as ben's sweet hottie girlfriend linda, the fabulous bernadette peters as flaky saloon singer little dee, brad dexter as the feckless mayor, david doyle as a slimy bank president, andrew stevens as an affable gas station attendant, john carpenter movie regular charles cyphers as one of the 'nam vets, anthony carbone as a smarmy casino manager, john steadman as a folksy old diner owner, paul gleason as a mean strong-arm shakedown bully, and dick miller as a talentless piano player. moral: don't hire other people to do your dirty work. william cronjager's slick cinematography, gerald fried's lively, harmonic hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence further add to the overall trashy fun of this unjustly neglected little doozy.

this movie could only originate in the 1970's!! it's a bizarre action movie set in a small california workers town. some sort of mill or plant is closing down, so suddenly, rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets! the townsfolk's are fed up! so ben arnold (jan michael vincent), goes to another town to recruit his brother, aaron, played by kris kristofferson. aaron is a vietnam vet who looks and acts a littleoff balance. he hangs out with a bunch of other surly vietnam vet's. they come into town to clean it up (they become deputized), but underneath their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc.!!! it takes a while for people to catch on, and in a biblical cain and abel showdown, vincent has to take on his older brother. there's an interesting blue-collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cock-fighting scene!). vincent is almost too angelic in this role  he thinks so highly of his brother, he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds he's accused of. he finally comes to his senses  his girlfriend, victoria principal, is brutally shot in the back & he himself is beaten up in his home. kris kristofferson is creepily effective as aaron. he coolly denies any wrong-doing, and even gently coos and talks to vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as 'uncle aaron') even while he's threatening her father's life, all the while smiling! vincent and kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. bernadette peters makes an interesting appearance as a 'saloon' girl who attracts aaron's attention. this is a good 70's action movie, if you can find it!! it is not available on dvd yet

this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s. it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today. the story is about a vietnam vet (kris kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (jan-michael vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of. it's great seeing kris play against type. bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars. jan-michael shows real movie star persona in this film. i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv. it's a great flick for guys who like movies.

i used to watch this show as a child, and i loved it! i watched it when it came on toonami years ago....sheesh, i sound so old! i must've been 13 or 14 when it came on...but anyways, it had a great plot line, and i'm one of those girlie-girls who watched (and adored) sailormoon, and i enjoyed it very much. the animation wasn't the best....quite amusing in some parts, actually, and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning, but it was all a good watch, and i found myself sucked into it day after day.samurai troopers/ronin warriors is a classic, and an all-time one of my faves. go ryo!!!!

for starters, i didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. i have not once seen it on tv before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. it is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years.i don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. when the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years. this gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.the overall design is also something very different. at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).if you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. the only question remains though, where is the dvd?!

the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story. julie winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed filthy city, ridden with crime, and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through. the maxx is her friend and client, a street bum who thinks he's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around?the maxx is not to be missed for the artwork, the story itself, or the excellent voice work - particularly the late barry stigler's deliciously urbane, drippingly evil voicing of the main villain, mr. gone.if you get the chance to see this, don't miss it.

"most of us at least inhabit two worlds , the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within ,the unconscious ,a safe place where we can escape ..." with those words ,mr .gone introduces inside the world of "the maxx" a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined . inspired in the comic books of sam kieth, "the maxx " is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired , not only in the story but also in the graphic style ,that look like the pages of the comic ,giving this show a surreal and unique appearance . but also ,the story it's interesting and entertaining .at moments it could turn too weird ,but when you got inside it ,it's hard to get out of it . the story and the characters are wonderfully developed . the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere . unfortunately , like many good animated shows ,this one was short -lived . "the maxx" is a must see . it 's one of my all -time favorites .

the internet database lists this as a tv show. and yes, it was a series on mtv shown on the "oddities" program, after "the head" and before "aeon flux" if i recall correctly. but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes.you have the story of the maxx, julie winters, sarah and mr. gone. the maxx is a super-hero or a bum, julie a social worker or a leopard queen, sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr. gone a guy who can't seem to keep his head on. and then there's the other weird creatures...i use "or" with maxx and julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are dreams. maybe they're all real or dreams. maybe one of the characters doesn't exist. maybe only one exists and dreams of the others. you'll have to wait and find out.i had the comic books before the show came out, and it was one of my favorites. the artwork was spectacular and the story was original -- unlike anything you'll find in superman or batman. it will bend your mind, and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. and the show used basically the same exact artwork (only now it moves) and the same story... guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced. this was the best show to appear on "oddities", hands down.if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip, this is a show to check out. it's "donnie darko" before there was ever such a thing.the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series, but i don't say this in disappointment. by keeping it simple, they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures.

it was on at 7:30am, too close to school to see very often. the animation & computer graphics were spectacular for the time. the idea of cowboys & ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles & robots was amazing. maybe it inspired treasure planet.unfortunately, it's really boring in the dvd format. the shows are all basically identical. when viewing non-sequential episodes on a dvd, you're stoned by disk #3. by today's standards, the animation is spotty. we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead.the bright spots are the heroine characters. they were a lot more believable, took themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and weren't corny. they actually saved men.

though this series only ran a season, it has stayed with me for 20 years. it was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever. i would give nearly anything to have it on dvd or whatever format i can get. if you find any means of seeing this series i suggest you take full advantage. this series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes. it also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them. heck the character goose actually scared me sometimes. he was just that odd at the time. also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of clint eastwood/tommy lee jones. if anyone has any way of contacting the creator/holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on dvd please by all means do so!!!

and i gave it a high 7.....why? because it bloody well rocked. at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys/games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. as others have said here it was ahead of its time. sadly this is why the show was doomed. they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far. i am hoping that more come out. how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out.. i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that imho is it's only flaw. the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition........ i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order... the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite this the show rocked.

damn straight.....this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. i can't wait to track down some of the dvd's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. i've already introduced him to voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and i laughed my head off when he said to me one day "dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid!!" how cool is that.come on hollywood, dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. couldn't be any worse than spiderman 3 was...man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.ok, i'll shuddup nowcheers

it has been 16 years since it's original run, i would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts.the animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today. it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available.

this game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. the city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of venom and carnage are appearing all over the city. who is behind these crimes? could it be doc ock? well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later spidey will unravel the mystery. the fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. you get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. however, that is also a weak point. the swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. you also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say spider-man 2 movie video game. still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. so be prepared to see scorpion, rhino, venom, mysterio, doctor octopus, and carnage for one wild action packed ride.

if you played "spider-man" on the ps version, then you've seen it all. to truly experience it you should get the dc version. simply put it's a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin. i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day. well, marvel: ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. if you have a dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. the dc version is simply incredible.

rated e(contains violence).i had the original spiderman game for the pc for a couple of years now.i still have not beaten it because on windows xp there is a glitch on one level which i cant beat because of it.so be warned if you have xp.but for those who don't have xp give this game a try.its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan.in the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit crimes.spiderman is a fun little game and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a fun,clean game for their kids.8/10

summary- this game is the best spider-man to hit the market!you fight old foes such as scorpion,rhino,venom,doctor octopus,carnage,...and exclusive to the game...monster-ock!monster-ock is the symbiote carnage on dock ock's body.storyline- dock ock was supposedly reformed and using his inventions for mankind...supposedly...he was really planing a symbiote invasion! see the rest for yourself.features- you can play in numerous old costumes seen throughout the comics.almost every costume has special abilities!you can collect comics in the game and then view them in a comic viewer.and last but not least..............spidey-armour!collect a gold spider symbol to change into spider-armour.it gives you another health bar!graphics- great!though they they can be rough at times.but still great!sound- sweet!nice music on every level and great voice overs!overall- 10 out of 10.this game rocks.buy it today!

spider-man is in my opinion the best superhero ever, and this game is the best superhero game ever. while it may be somewhat easy, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers, which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game. it may seem hard to control at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will be web-slinging like spider-man himself.the bosses, while like the levels are somewhat easy, are fun. the first boss, scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which shouldn't be so because as fans of the comic books know, scorpion is one of spider-man's most deadly villains. the second boss, rhino, is also very easy. the 3rd boss is venom, who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game, which definately shouldn't be. the 4th boss is venom again. this time, he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy. the 5th boss is mysterio, who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game. he is also one of the harder bosses, but once again, still fairly easy. next boss is carnage, who is, you guessed it, easy to beat. but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight. 7th boss is doctor octopus, who is like all the other bosses easy, but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield. the 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic book or cartoon. i won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn't too easy. took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries.all in all, a very good game. i gave it an 8 out of 10. the reasons why i didn't give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring (getting all that stuff will take a while though), it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used hobgoblin and/or green goblin as a boss, i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air! they didn't use them in the sequel to this game either! well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider-man movie, so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie.

this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, spiderman improves in both departments. it also features the voice of stan lee, the creator of spiderman comics.as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can. he does more than spin webs. in fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. when he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. spidey has his hands full as he battles venom, rhino, mysterio, scorpion, and dr. octopus to name a few. look for captain america in a cameo.most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. if you're a real marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. better luck in "spiderman 2." my evaluation: 9 out of 10.

an enjoyable game, which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability. staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today. also, the narration and animated scenes used (though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo 64 version) use full advantage of the platforms' capabilities.

13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint. the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively, the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith (davy crocket) and lorne greene (sam houston) were too old.raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle. the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand. failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military. santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene.kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson, a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage. however, kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron.

when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville, texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. as long as that stands, we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen. one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this century.but i would say the alamo: thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i've seen. john wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne. brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.it's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that. tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result.alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. one thing that was not explored and hasn't been was travis's hyperactive sex drive. he was the casanova of the southwest, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie, played here by james arness. he was a hero at the alamo to be sure, but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel. he was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. but his heroic death certainly redeemed him. no hint of that is in arness's portrayal nor any others i've seen of bowie on the screen. and of course he did design the bowie knife, done to his specifications. that man needed such a weapon.however the main asset that the alamo: thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna, the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation. unfortunately those americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south, at least liberty for white people. raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history. he was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came along.this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston. greene's not quite my conception of houston, he really was way too old for the part, houston was in his early forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of texas. but within the limits imposed on him, greene does a fine job.for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne's version, but for historical content i recommend this film highly.

this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective, more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events, though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston, bowie, travis and crockett.the focus here is on jim bowie, played with sharp, cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age 85. then 65, he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part.puerto rican-born raul julia humanizes gen. santa ana as no one since j. carol naish back in '54 had done. however, the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous, vainglorious popinjay--gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since. he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but, convinced of his own infallibility, he does not heed it.alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays: col. william travis. his portrayal is earnest. he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him.the one jarring note was brian keith as crockett. in a coonskin cap and carrying ol' betsy, he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie. with no conviction in the portrayal, the character is reduced to a few stage conventions. the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions. we learn that jim bowie was, in the person of santa ana, fighting his own brother-in-law. the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier. "santa ana likes a bargain." bowie wryly explains. the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill- advised--a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film "the alamo".

the best film on the battle of san antonio, texas in march 1836, was john wayne's 1960 epic the alamo. in a one shot job as director producer, that temporarily financially strapped him, wayne demonstrated that he was talented in movie making outside of his icon-like acting ability personifying the west.i have commented on that film in a review the other night, and i pointed out that wayne and james edward grant (the screenwriter) tackled some points that were barely mentioned in earlier films about the battle. they did bring in the issue of slavery. they also finally discussed the contribution of local mexican land owner juan seguin as an important leader in the war for independence on par with crockett, bowie, travis, austin, and houston. but there was one weakness (though well hidden) in the film. wayne worked hard to cast it properly, thinking of many people for lead roles in it. but, he did not properly handle the leader of the enemy forces, general antonio de santa anna. the role was played by an obscure actor, ruben padilla (on this board, his thread shows only three credits listed). padilla did not have any spoken dialog (even in spanish). and while he does have one of the last shots in the film, he just is shown as a silent tyrant, observing the burning of the bodies of the americans and their allies.despite several poor choices in the casting of this television movie (the alamo: thirteen days to clory), it is the best film in showing the man who was (from 1836 to 1854) a leading bogeyman to american policy makers. raul julia was a wonderful stage actor. i was fortunate to see him in a production (in the late 1980s) of arms and the man in manhattan, as sergius. he was never boring, and usually first rate in his acting.here we see the egotistical monster at his worst. nothing is acceptable that does not fit santa anna's wishes or activities. it can be the failure of an orderly in the army to bring some item he requested fast enough, or it can be the temerity of these "foreign brigands" (as he saw the americans) in not knuckling down to himself, "the napoleon of the west".santa anna was president of mexico five or six times between 1830 and 1855. he claimed that he first got involved in overthrowing a president because that president did not live up to the country's constitution, but it was the power that kept him going year after year. it is a sad commentary that he was the leading mexican historical figure in those two decades. no political figure or military figure would rise to override him until benito juarez did in the late 1850s. initially he claimed great liberal ideals, but he once admitted that the people of mexico were children who needed guidance for one hundred years before they could rule themselves (and thus he sounds like gilbert roland in crisis talking about the people he has helped lead against jose ferrer). the amazing thing about him was he managed to keep coming back. his policies were disasters. while we know about his attack on texas (to put down a revolt there), he also tried to expand into guatamala (and probably saw himself controlling much of central america). he did win at the alamo, but at great cost of lives. his massacre of col. fannin's men at goliad was inexcusable (one might make a case for the destruction of the defenders of the alamo who were fighting to the last, but fannin had surrendered). then came the disaster of san jacinto, where his army was wiped out (he failed to take adequate precautions to watch for the american troops). he was captured, and humiliated, and forced to sign a surrender of texas. houston was kind to him: the troops wanted to string him up.except for losing a leg in a battle against the french in 1838, he managed not to get wounded in most of his wars. he repudiated the forced surrender of texas, but could not militarily undue it. instead, he would lead mexico into defeat in the war of 1846 - 48 against the americans, leading to the mexican session. the u.s. was "decent" enough to pay mexico $15,000,000 for the southwest, but mexico lost half of it's territory. he would be president for the last time in 1853, in time to give franklin pierce's horrendously bad administration it's one moment of glory - santa anna sold the border of arizona and new mexico (the "gadsden purchase") to the u.s. no other mexican president (not even porfirio diaz) ever cost his country so much (diaz did sell out to foreign business interests, but he built up mexico's economic muscles doing so). he was exiled in 1855, and settled in staten island. there he managed to do his most creative work: he introduced chicle to the u.s., and it became chewing gum. some achievement! julia's santa anna is younger than the practiced cynic and schemer who became america's best land purchase agent. he is not going to stand for opposition and he jumps into furious tantrums at a moment's notice. most of the time his chief aide, col. black (david ogden stiers, here a british born officer) holds his tongue - he does not wish to be in front of a firing squad as he could be. but stiers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss. at the end, when alone with the newly widowed wives of the dead alamo defenders, stiers suggests that they tell the world what santa anna is really like. and they did!

heres a fun fact, i was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) i am 19 years old now. my parents took me to try out for the part, we lived in texas at the time.i think i only made like 80 bucks for it, but i wasn't in it very long. my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry. i was all mixed up. strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no i am not a child actress. i am livin' in san antonio, workin' at a walgreens. i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life. this movie is a great movie, though, good concept. i have seen it several times in my short 19 years.

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting. the writing was top-notch. james arness is a great actor and he showed it here. brian keith was too old to be davy crockett, and can anyone really play davy but fess parker?another great actor in this move was raul julia, who gave depth to santa anna, a vain and complex person who led mexico through turbulent times.while some may think the movie was slow-paced, it captured the battle as it unfolded, lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.what impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. in this day and age when nobody stands for anything, i found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time.

by no means a masterpiece, and far from errol flynn's best, istanbul still has much going for it. the locations and beautiful technicolour cinematography, bring us back to a time long since past. errol flynn does show moments of his past glory, and is ok as jim brennan, a pilot who's past comes back to haunt him. the picture is actually a remake of 1947's "singapore", and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche' by today's standards. also many of the supporting cast seem to be simply "going through the motions" in this picture. many people have also compared it to one of the all time greats, casablanca. while watching the film, i could see many of the similarities, but hey, casablanca has inspired countless imitators, so take that for what it's worth. in closing, if you are a fan of flynn, or old fashioned love stories, you might want to give this film a look. otherwise, i'd recommend casablanca, or the maltese falcon, as a good introduction to some of hollywood's classics....

only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie. superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human creature's understanding. this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice. stories come and go, but the idea for a good story is to think positive, not negative thoughts. to create a good versus evil battle like never before. embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other. striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world.

wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince (simon) who is banished from his kingdom due to his father (the king) being killed by the cliche "evil adviser". this movie's about simon's adventures. the special effects, plot, acting, and generally everything about this movie is bad. however, it's so bad that it's funny. you will keep watching this movie simply because it's so bad it's funny, and, like the other reviewer of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.

i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie.it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990.a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure.it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever.we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.it is a true gem.the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever.if you see this movie for rent in a video store,steal it.you won't regret it!

this movie is horrible- in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way.the storyline is rehashed from so many other films of this kind, that i'm not going to even bother describing it. it's a sword/sorcery picture, has a kid hoping to realize how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide/sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature....you get the point.the first time i caught this movie was during a very harsh winter. i don't know why i decided to continue watching it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when i caught site of gulfax, i decided to stay and watch it until the end.gulfax is a white, furry creature akin to chewbacca, but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch. he looks like someone glued a bunch of white shag carpeting together and forced the actor to wear it. there are scenes where it looks like the actor cannot move within, or that he's almost falling over. although he isn't in the movie that much, the few scenes are worth it! watch as he attempts to talk smack to bo svenson, taking the solo-chewbacca comparison's to an even higher level! i actually bought this movie just because of that character, and still have it somewhere! gulfax may look like sh!t, but he made this movie!!! the only reason i've never seen the sequel, or even sought it out, was because of his absence! perhaps should there be a final film, completing the trilogy, gulfax will make a much-anticipated return!

when i saw this movie first, it was long ago on vhs-video. i did like this movie, because it was funny and excitingly. some years ago i saw another movie, called: *andy colby's incredible adventure* in this movie were parts of *wizards of the lost kingdom* used in. they called this movie "kor the conquerer". i began to search for the "kor"-movie many years, because i wanted to see the complete movie, not only the parts which were used in the *andy colby*-movie. no shop had this kor-movie to rent and no shop did know this movie. many years i watched my old vhs-tapes i had at home, and what a wonder... i had this movie since many years still at home, but the movie had a different title, because in germany it has 3 or 4 titles. so i was happy to find this tape at home and this time i had much more time in watching *kor the conquerer again. the music is great during the hole movie, but the best part of filming in combination with the music is this moment, when kor is walking drunken through the green forrest. the music in the background had some kind of magic. i like bo svenson, and also the boy, who played simon in the movie. both of them did their job very good. manfred kraatz, germany, 26.10.2004. thanks to all for reading my comment.

although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, i am ashamed to say i rather like it. not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham! video, so it is most definitely worth a viewing (£0.79 a night in my local store!). watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume, the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following: evil wizard-type bloke: "at last we meet kor..." kor: "thrilling, isn't it?"amazing!!i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. no, i'm not joking...there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird, it's just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion. this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value!!

maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale. whatever the reason, i thought it was pitch perfect. great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially de niro, who is awesome). this movie made me happier than i've been for a while.it is a very funny and clever movie. the running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. that's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again.

going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. especially a romantic fantasy.little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic. everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection.claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie. from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character.michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty.robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax.overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike, stardust is the way to go.

highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star(i could gaze at her for quite some time) to michelle pfeiffer(i could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. mark strong, jason flemyng, and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.

although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. when i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. and i was right. stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. it has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. the storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. like every tale , it has some short of morality. therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative. i have to give extra credits to claire danes. she literally shines in this movie. her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. moreover, she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movieoverall , the movie is fantastic, the locations magical and the plot interesting.i was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. i have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.

i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and everyone who actually saw it (that i know) absolutely loved it... the advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder.opened at #4 behind...#1-rush hour, which i have not seen, average imdb score of 7.4.#2-the bourn ultimatum, which i have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average imdb score of 8.7 (deserving i would say).#3-the simpsons movie, which i have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average imdb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).#4-stardust, average imdb score of 8.4 (lower then bourn, but that's been our for 3 weeks).whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale too bad :( anyway- now that i have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... awesome movie, go see it!

this remarkable film can be summed up very easily. first of all, while the comparisons to "princess bride" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. while both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, "stardust" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film i've ever seen. it's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. thirdly, i did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. in fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. this fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one i've seen since "return of the king" (not that i am comparing the two at all). ok, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!

please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie!never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen. bold, because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, i've seen this before' or 'i am sure this is what will happen now' - stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story.the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in. michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star', yvaine. other big names make outstanding roles. i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie. but once again, the story by neil gaiman, all the little things he 'invented' for this universe - simply outstanding.i watched this movie at a pre-screening today, a day before the official release, and do hope it will have huge success. there is so much humor, but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes. the look in the eyes of yvaine, the 'frivolities' of captain shakespeare, the passion of lamia the witch - impressive, unforgettablefor me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it11/10 - outstandingpeace and love

certain dvd's possess me until i just have to go out and buy it. this was one of those movies. like many on here, i remember seeing it as a child and loved it. i never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so i was intrigued to see what they might be. i will agree that the "portabellow road" sequence is now a tad long (as is the soccer game) but other than that, i found no qualms with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place. perhaps disney should have had the original version (which is the restored version) on one side with the restored version on the flip side, then people could choose what they wanted to view. all in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories.

bedknobs & broomsticks is another one of disney's masterpieces. it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations. (a similar concept was used in mary poppins when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art.) i am mainly rating this film through child's eyes because i have not seen it in years. back then, it was one of my favourite films. it was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle) were my favourites. there was also a lot of stop-animation used with the spells (ie, people turning into rabbits), which may be a little dated and silly now. (also, i believe that the film starts off slowly.) through the eyes of a child, this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film. it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely-forgotten today.

i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it. i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much.too much some have said. i have 27 copies on video and i love them all equally. i also love anyone else who loves it. i love you. my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road. i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday. i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song. if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks band.i hope to call it 'the knobs'. love me (liz)

what a great gem this is. it's an unusual story that is fun to watch. yes, it has singing, but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear. it was so pleasant to watch; i enjoyed it from start to finish! the movie takes place in england during world war ii. it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs. she uses her rough "magic" to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it. they are joined by her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! although the special effects may seem a little dated at first, once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie. in fact, the movie won an oscar for these effects! the movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs. the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie.

this is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever. unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, and charming.the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of peppering eye, where three cockney children, charlie, carrie, & paul rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from world war ii city air raids. they are mistakingly sent to live with eglantine price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed. here they encounter emilius browne, the fraudulent headmaster of miss price's witchcraft training correspondence school. miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the bookman and his associate, swinburne.angela lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, miss price. david tomlinson plays mr. browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. this actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie mary poppins. in fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as chim-chim-cheree, but it does boast some appealing little tunes. some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. all in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. it's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which should appeal to the child in all of us.

a great movie. lansbury and tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances, with a particular mention for the "portobello ballet" are gorgeous. as for the animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating. i recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video. here in italy we have only the 98 minutes version, although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes. if possible, watch also the german videocassette: it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it's missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders!

what a wonderful, fanciful movie "stardust" is.i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say, one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it.at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, "stardust" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. ironically, "stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for."stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. it has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern."stardust" is about a man from the town of wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by david kelly). one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named una. she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. while the witch is away, una seduces ben and sends him on his way. ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life. but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.the boy, named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (charlie cox) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another. nevertheless, the young lady (named victoria and played sienna miller) goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her. after they espy a falling star, she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. he agrees and sets out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall.meanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by peter o'toole) is dying. he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne. his sons' names are primus, secondus, sextmus, and septimus. the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne.anyway, he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila, that what brings the star to earth.the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine (clare danes) and she, of course, is wearing the charm. but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain, the princes, and also an aging witch named lamia (michelle pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.complicated? yes. but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds.tristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine. his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love. but he must get past the princes and lamia first. the princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in "pirates of the caribbean" - never has death been so funny. but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by robert deniro.his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee. he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter. though his role is small in length, deniro is extraordinary!michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia - a sexy evil witch. claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine. she makes a perfect damsel. jason flemyng, adam buston, rupert everett, and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom, as they die return as ghosts ala "blithe spirit" and "high spirits".moreover director matthew vaughn, whose only other directing experience was "layer cake", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy."stardust" may be too complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times. it's that good. "stardust" is what movies are supposed to be. perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted. in other words...perfect.

this movie is one of the best ever produced by disney.the plot is very original and entertaining. the animated sequence is also very well done with the live actors. (for the time).perhaps one of my favorite sequences is contained in this movie with the march of the suits of armor.

angela lansbury plays eglantine a middle aged lady in war torn england, during the wwi. she has been studying witchcraft by mail, and has been secretly learning it in her home, she is doing well, until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid, are sent to stay in angela lansbury's huge house. she is not happy about having them, because of her secret. they only want to go back home. the oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat. the other two a boy and a girl are just inquisitive about their new place to stay and the lady that is their hostess. the kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins. fun and more of it. family fun. laughter, frolic, adventure, something for everyone. the special effects are quite good. this is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other disney films. add this to your family video library. you will not be disappointed.

delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england.lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part. she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril.the film follows the adventures of miss price (lansbury) and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery. those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age.too bad that tessie o'shea, roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film.i really thought of the ben stiller film-"night at the museum," at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town.

never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the walt disney studios and great animation creations. angela lansbury, (eglantine price) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off. eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world. however, eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch. mr. emerlius browne, (david tomlinson) was the person who sold eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution. eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the nazi's from evading england. great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.

i saw this when on the wonderful world of disney as a kid, so i didn't recall much of it. as i watched it recently, i sat there thinking, "this is the weirdest thing i've seen".the 'traveling' scenes look like something caused by an lsd overdose. the animated characters are mostly oddly colored/voiced versions of jungle book and robin hood characters. some not-so-disney things i noticed: kids being threatened at knife point and prostitutes(during the portobello road song).it was very entertaining, though the musical numbers were long and i can see little kids getting bored with them. also, the subject manner was a bit dark, seeing as it was set during ww2.

mary poppins is definitely much better, but this is a lovely film nonetheless. angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price, and david tomlinson has great fun as mr. brown. their chemistry was just brilliant as well. the children, however just lacked the same sparkle, though paul is very funny and cute. the songs were actually not as bad as some people say, "beautiful briny sea" is the best, in fact all the songs are outstanding. the special effects were wonderful, that had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough. the highlights, though, like mary poppins, were the animated sequences. the underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favourite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it. all in all, a lovely film, that is hardly ever on. 8/10 bethany cox

perhaps disney was hoping for another mary poppins but this is a very different story and while angela is delightful she was a very different performer to the great julie andrews. having said that lansbury is perfectly cast and delivers a magical performance. there is something deliciously dotty about her character and she is given wonderful support by david tomlinson. tomilinson can carry a tune but he is certainly not much chop as a singer. it does not matter he was such a gifted actor you hardly notice. there are some great cameos from much loved stars of another time like roddy mcdowel who gives a winning performance and the much loved tessie oshea who does very little but its nice to see the old gal again. its also lovely to see sam jaffe and the king of english television bruce forsythe in small roles. the score has a couple of beautiful songs especially the briny sea and the age of not believing. the big number portabello road is stretched to the limit but it has plenty of theatricality. the effects look a bit cliché today but the scene with the german invaders being attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. the kids are not as annoying as other movies but one does struggle to understand what the youngest boy is saying. i loved the marching song of the home army. the home guard were very important to britain and this is a warm tribute. the animation is delightful, much better than pixar which i find grotesque. a warm happy film and its a wonder its not done on stage.

okay, this film is about bedknobs and broomsticks, it's one of the most charming, delightful movies you'll ever see as a kid. it's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun. it may be a little deniable to watch, but try it, i neither my mother didn't think it was bad, i was very enthused with the movie and the animation, they were all quite good.it is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy; even the kids. ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful, musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation. the animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up. it's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for? go to the video store and rent bedknobs and broomsticks now.

in loving memory of david tomlinson (1917-2000)when i watched this movie for the first time i was 4 years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd world war. the scene, which impressed me the most, was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army. it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march. this movie is fantastic, from the trip to portobello road (which became to me the most fantastic place of london) to the journey to naboomboo. angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple. she is always great, it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co-protagonist. we'll miss him a lot.

i've just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it's certainly made for a curious afternoon's entertainment. bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form, the deleted scenes (especially those with mcdowall) link events together quite neatly. what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered. clearly, the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged, so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue. which would have been great except that half the cast weren't around to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it. some of the lip-synching is pretty poor, and david tomlinson's voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson (there's actually a hint of german in it, i think). however, good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although 'step in the right direction' is still absent) and the moments of magic in this film still shine through. and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos "but what's that got to do with my knob??"

this is the epitome of fairytale! the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure. danes, deniro,and pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan. outstanding performances, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous! i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience, there are plenty of hilarious subtleties! the previews do not do this movie justice! my fiancé and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try!

i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime, though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks. although i personally wouldn't have crossed live-action with animation, it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters. the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country. i would have to say that the casting was brilliant. angela landsbury made a perfect miss price, while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest. endings always surprise me and this was no exception. it was neither happy nor sad, though i do not know if this was intentional. the dialog wasn't great, but considering it was designed to be a kid's movie, that is alright. overall, i would give the performance nine out of ten, the dialog six out of ten, the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten.

i will always have a soft spot for this disney flick, another of their part live action/part animation entries that sought to recreate the success of "mary poppins" and never quite made it. when i was in grade school, every once in a while we would have a movie day, where the whole school would crowd into the cafeteria, and a movie would be projected the old-fashioned way, multiple reels and all. at the time, it seemed like a momentous occasion whenever this day arrived, and "bedknobs and broomsticks" is one of the movies i can remember seeing this way.and from what i remember, it's quite charming. angela lansbury never put her name to anything that wasn't at least competent, and she's winning here as a witch with a magic bed (boy, that could be misconstrued, couldn't it?) who can take her and a couple of young kids on magic adventures to far-off places. come on, what kid wouldn't want a bed like that? grade: a

fabulous, fantastic, probably disney's best musical adventure. i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, clever and fun. even despite the silly "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny. could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine? i cannot think of anyone more suited to the role. remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins.david tomlinson, though he had few quality movie roles, absolutely shines in this adventure. he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays. blustering, prim and proper englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does. it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice.the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just don't capture. i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can.bobbing along, bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny, sea. richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers. all of them are fantastic and worth remembering, portobello road being one of my favorites.a great film that still holds up today!!

the obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy bedknobs and broomsticks and c.s. lewis chronicles of narnia are pretty apparent. there are more coincidences here than comparing bedknobs and broomsticks than with mary poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films.like the chronicles of narnia it involves some english children leaving london during the blitz and coming to live in the country. and those kids have to deal with a world of magic. but unlike c.s. lewis the rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. no retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the pevensie kids.no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like david tomlinson. ms. lansbury didn't get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top. and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film.two performers made their farewell to films in bedknobs and broomsticks. tessie o'shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. and that grand character actor reginald owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.the team of robert b. sherman and richard m. sherman who wrote the score for mary poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar, but lost to the theme from shaft. personally though i do like david tomlinson's tribute to that most colorful of london streets, portabello road.bedknobs and broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.

i was lucky enough to catch this film finally on turner classic films tonight, as it is one of the films that won an oscar (for special effects) in their yearly month of oscar winning films. bedknobs and broomsticks is easily a sequel film for the earlier success of mary poppins. that film too was a big success, and an oscar winner (best actress for julie andrews). like mary poppins bedknobs has david tomlinson in it, in a role wherein he learns about parenting. it is a fine mixture of live action and animation. it is set in a past period of british history (if not the edwardian - georgian world of 1912 london, it is england's coastline during the "dunkirk" summer of 1940). it even has old reginald owen in it, here as a general in the home guard, whereas formerly he was admiral boom in mary poppins. ironically it was owen's final role.the home guard sequences (not too many in the film) reminds one of the british series dad's army, dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years of the war. the period is also well suggested by the appearance of the three rawlins children as war orphans from the bombings in the blitz in london. and (in typical disney fashion) in the musical number "portobello road" different members of the british army (including soldiers from india and the caribbean (complete with metal drums yet!)) appear with scottish and local female auxiliaries in costume.all of which, surprisingly, is a plus. but the biggest plus is that for angela lansbury, her performance as eglantine price is finally it: her sole real musical film lead. in a noteworthy acting career, lansbury never got the real career musical role she deserved as auntie mame in the musical mame that came out shortly after bedknobs did. she had been in singing parts (in gaslight with her brief up in a balloon boys, and in the picture of dorian gray with little yellow bird, and - best of all - in support and in conclusion of the harvey girls with the final reprise of on the atchison, topeka, and the santa fe). but only here does she play the female lead. so when you hear her singing with david tomlinson you may be able to understand what we lost when she did not play mame dennis burnside.the rest of the cast is pretty good, tomlinson here learning that he can rise to the occasion after a lifetime of relative failure. the three children (cindy o'callaghan, roy snart, and ian weighill) actually showing more interesting sides in their characters than their edwardian predecessors in poppins (weighill in particular, as something of a budding opportunist thinking of blackmailing lansbury after finding out she is a witch). the only surprising waste (possibly due to cutting of scenes) is roddy mcdowall as the local vicar who is only in two sequences of the film. with his possible role as a disapproving foe of witchcraft he should have had a bigger part. also of note is john ericson, as the german officer who leads a raid at the conclusion of the film, only to find that he is facing something more powerful than he ever imagined in the british countryside, and sam jaffe as a competitor for the magic formula that lansbury and tomlinson are seeking. as for the animation, the two sequences under the sea in a lagoon, and at the wildest soccer match ever drawn are well worth the view, with tomlinson pulled into the latter as the referee, and getting pretty badly banged up in various charges and scrimmages. as i said it is a pretty fine sample of the disney studio's best work.

"bedknobs and broomsticks" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best disney works. it has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of england.it also combines very well live-action and animation. the animation itself is, of course, pretty good. the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film "robin hood" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in "robin hood". besides, the king (a lion) seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard, not to mention that the bear does look like little john.this movie is often compared to "mary poppins" with a reason. both combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. both have similar settings in london. both have their own magic and a magical woman. the kids (carrie, charlie and cute little paul) are a bit like the banks children. both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david tomlinson. however, instead of a very serious man like george banks, david tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - professor emelius browne. with its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry potter's stories.the majority of the songs are good. "the age of not believing" and "the beautiful briny sea" are the very best. "portobello road" is nice too.david tomlinson is great in this film once again. angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too: cindy o'callaghan as carrie, ian weighill as charlie (a boy in «the age of not believing») and roy snart as the youngest brother paul.i like the black cat. it's pretty cool. it looks a bit like salem, the black cat from the tv series "sabrina, the teenage witch". i find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit. rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. i just love them! even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he's transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. it's really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache.overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad. the first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. the ending, however, is weak. that's my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling.

this movie has always been my favorit disney movie. then on 11/21/01 i saw the 30th aniversy of this movie dvd. wow i remembered why i loved this movie. the dvd is so great, it has an extra 30 min that the original did not have. i did not know this when i first started watching. the movie made ever so much more since. the music they cut out should have been left in. you have not seen this movie until you have seen the full 131 min version. a lot of people say that the music is forgettable. i remember every song in this movie by heart, every song has it's own charm by it's self, and comes together as a hole. i remember when i was younger i had the "eglantine" song stuck in my head for days at a time. as well as "briny sea" (that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the film) please watch the new uncut 30th aniversy movie and re-vote for this movie. the 10 that it really is.

this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island. we got it and have watched it repeatedly since; in fact we've rented it several times since. there are very few non-animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid. the acting is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they get deep into your head and you can't help but singing along. the storyline, while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch. i've heard it compared to mary poppins, but i think they are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins. this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents won't mind complying with. there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i don't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie.

what can i say about a tale such as this? this magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart.the characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene. for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore. i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.the story line was wonderful.i wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with mr.brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.i am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. this movie is my definite favorite of all times. i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time.

this place in england during 1940. three orphans (carrie, charles and paul) are sent to live with miss price (angela lansbury). she doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in. it seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the college of witchcraft. (ok--i realize this is a family film but--college of witchcraft??? come on!!) before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war (???) and she seeks down the head professor browne (david tomlinson). and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob.i first saw this when i was 9 and vaguely remember loving it. it sure doesn't hold up as an adult! the story is silly (even for a fantasy), the kids are terrible actors and one of them (charles) is incredibly obnoxious. also roddy mcdowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes! there's also a trip to the isle of naboombu which is run by animated animals. i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor (for disney) and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals. there are a few saving graces here: lansbury and tomlinson are just great; the songs (while forgettable) are pleasant; the long dance sequence on portobello road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar-winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end. but the weak story line, poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down. i heard the extended version is even worse! i can only give this a 7.

if any style of film could be called my "guilty pleasure", it'd be this generic fantasy type. guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. "stardust" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman (or gaiman adaptation, as it were). it isn't the visual dream-scape of mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic the princess bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. to make things difficult, however, tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.from there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, robert deniro as a gay pirate. on that note, deniro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting). deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil, and that's saying something.stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. i can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.--polarisdib

spoiler alert!!!!i had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks. though i did like the extended version, i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd.the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length. it was too long and dragged the movie along. though the dancing is great, would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene.all in all this is a great movie. my 5 year old liked it. and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation. this and mary poppins are added to my collection.just as i had remembered!*** out of ****

set during wwii, bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids, starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who, with the help of three evacuee children and a 'professor of witchcraft', thwarts a nazi invasion.brilliantly inventive, with loads of laughs, this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters, exciting story and catchy tunes. lansbury is perfect as eglantine, the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime, and her three young co-stars (cindy o'callaghan, roy snart and ian weighill) are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun.the special effects are somewhat dated, but let's face it, kids don't care too much about these things, so long as they are entertained. and entertained, they will be. with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect, and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters, it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism. in fact, only a rather drawn-out musical number set in portobello road mars the film's perfection, but with so much else to enjoy, that can easily be forgiven.and besides, any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a 'flash' harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me.

i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i, too found mary poppins (although i love julie andrews and dick vandyke) to be silly and sacrine-sweet. angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted. it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch. every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better. you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other, despite their age and differences. i thought the characters were well developed, especially charles who was at "the age of not believing". mary poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and cherish.

this is one of the few films where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book. the story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional. i adored the cyclical rendition of 'the old home guard' and the charming 'portobello road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which, though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece. the background of the second world war worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.an often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. the performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. guaranteed to put a smile on your face!

greetings again from the darkness. this one will be compared to "the princess bride" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. the story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.charlie cox plays tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (sienna miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning claire danes. not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by michelle pfeiffer and the prince son of king peter o'toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our "star" is wearing. lots of bad chasing the good.along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the carribbean). robert deniro plays captain shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. another encounter involves the brilliant ricky gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director matthew vaughn's ("layer cake") effort deserves an audience. sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. my guess it will find big success on video.

this movie is wonderful.i was 'enchanted', i should say, and surprised because of how uniquely it was done. the cast, the sequencing, the effects...everything! magnificent! i mean, it was a love story, yes, but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining, wholesome manner.for me, it is the representation of modern fairy tale. it's like the modern peter pan...simply amazingi surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market.this movie is really a double must see one...!!!! 10 stars for that!

i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché, but i was completely wrong! charlie cox (i had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.claire danes, who i did like before (loved her in romeo and juliet), made me enjoy her even more. her acting was fantastic, i couldn't even tell that she was american. the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well-casted; deniro as that gay pirate...priceless, priceless. i laughed so hard at that one scene where septimus comes on the ship...oh my god, wow. pfeiffer played a decent villain, i liked her as the snippy mother in hairspray. but she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were, they were great; the cameos from ricky gervais and peter o'toole were also well-placed. i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings. it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out!

the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman (writer of mirrormask) and it's really a good story. i think it would appeal to any labyrinth, princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman. i won't spoil it for you.the main character, tristan (tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.it's a really good story. it has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. it's simply magical. it's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.

as a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of neil gaiman *in particular*, i've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that i can scarcely believe it's finally here. and you know what? i needn't have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.the special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly princes (whose roll-call read almost as a "who's who" of currently cool british comedy - rupert everett, david walliams of little britain fame, two of the blokes from green wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments, which exist in abundance. in fact, the one minor criticism i have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little ott, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... ricky gervais' cameo, for example, was far too much just "ricky gervais doing his usual david brent from the office comedy persona" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory i believe the ferdy character in the original book was pretty "ricky gervais"-esquire when i think back on it)....but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. charlie cox, as the protagonist tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a "humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest"; claire danes as yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; robert de niro, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball, too)... and michelle pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch lamia, my favourite performance of the film overall. if you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent "hairspray" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.so to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent. one of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic princess bride, and stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as the princess bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, i believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come.

while i don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray). boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide "in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! just about all the actors like claire danes, rupert everett, ricky gervais, peter o'toole and many others do fine work here. while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of sienna miller, olivia grant (as girl bernard), and kate magowan especially when we first meet her. newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan (actually ben barnes). many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with pb, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. so on that note, i highly recommended stardust.

there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film. as magically fairy-tale-like as the princess bride, stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, michelle pfeiffer and robert deniro's especially, i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.ten stars, and not a decimal less.

the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy. in case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), i'll sum it up here: it's more mature than ella enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds. think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical princess bride, and you'll be close. -------------------------------------------------------------i am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others... maybe once or twice a month, if i feel active. i'm also a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan. i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.by the end here (august), i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust. having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction, the previews of stardust seemed appealing, but i was certainly wary.as many others here, i was utterly surprised. i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast. don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief... but the most refreshing thing i found, is that it's not based on anything i've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.((unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas? i could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another "epic fantasy tale, the likes of lotr and the rest" so says the nyt and such and such no doubt.))stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was i sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. it didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (transformers, i'm looking at you). it's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy i hate those). i just... watched. watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes. sure, i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that. it even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in.it truly is a gem. after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.it's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (princess bride, black cauldron, the dark crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.simply wonderful.

this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wow.it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman's fault.sure, i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart, flowed smoothly,and made the characters completely believable.i could go on for days about the spectacular acting, charlie cox is perfect as tristan, claire daines is brilliant as yvaine, and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare.the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny, intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80's sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.special effects were near perfect, true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for, not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly.then there is the story? what can i say. how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff. it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time.any one of those things would have made this a good movie, all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well. once again neil gaiman has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it. i didn't want it to end, i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person, to travel it's fields and valleys, stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman, the sandman, american gods, coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over, i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different.in the end i'm sure that neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it.

the power to dream is a wonderful thing. there's a saying, "not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream." by exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. or build empires. perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. gain wisdom and benefit mankind. or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. freud might express such things in symbols. the language of fantasy.tristan ventures out of a rather twee english village called wall. he goes through a break in the wall. a portal. in search of something that will prove his love to victoria (sienna miller). victoria doesn't take him very seriously. so he pledges to bring back a falling star.stormhold is the world outside the wall. he discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, yvaine (claire danes). to complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of yvaine. if they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (one of the witches is played by michelle pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) the 'good guy' they meet on their way is captain shakespeare (robert de niro). he has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. heirs of stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the kingdom. ricky gervais is an added extras. a buffoon trader throwing in standard gervais-type gags well. tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of harry potter romps. production values rival hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.that is not to say that stardust is without its faults. plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. but if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.as a boy, i remember listening in wonder to albums by the moody blues (who practiced in a house not far from where i lived). they made records with names like "in search of the lost chord," and wrote lyrics like, "thinking is the best way to travel." i would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from timothy leary to aleister crowley. shaping dreams. learning to make them real. nowadays people might talk of nlp or positive thinking. adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. do you still enjoy that feeling?you are advised not to wait for stardust on dvd. see it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. and dolby digital surround sound if you can get it. the actors look like they had a ball. maybe you will too.

carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance! the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going. the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them. although the story isn't strong, the action is fun and draws you to the very end (which i felt could've had a sequel).campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu!!

except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. eight out of ten stars.

this movie is a lot of fun. the actors really make the movie go the distance though. without giving away the plot, i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie! (worth the price of admission just for that!) all the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.people of all ages will enjoy it. (my parents even did!) good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. good date movie. great for some escapism.deserves an a. (hope it does well at the box office)

the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with lord of the rings, harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office. this year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably the golden compass, which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year. stardust, based on a novel by neil gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. i saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. the critical reaction is kind of blah. i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because i went to see stardust, and i loved it. it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings. the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. but within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. and it succeeds wonderfully. there were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. there's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. it isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has (though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.

i was not expecting much from this movie. i was given a ticket for an advanced screening. i had just gotten off of work. it was hot and i was tired. i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. the actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical.

this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read) and colorful characters.one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.original. fun. feel-good fantasy.

ok here is how i do this. i grade movies on 10 components. each component will inherently start with 5 points. it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.mood: action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense - i give this component 10 points. it had a perfect balance of all five aspects. the action was fun and exiting. the romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.plot - i give this component 10 points. i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. i found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant i again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.cinema photography - i give this component 8 points. while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.fx - i give this component 10 points. i love that they used c.g.i. sparingly. the epic scenes were believable. the magical powers were frighteningly realistic. all in all less is more, and this had it all! cast - i give this component 10 points. no names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, charlie cox made tristan come to life, claire danes gave emotion to the stars, and i will never look and robert de niro the same again.acting - i give this component 10 points. even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. once again, i will never look and robert de niro the same again.character development - i give this component 9 points. this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.dialogue - i give this component 10 points. the dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.score - i give this component 7 points. i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.ending - i give this component 9 points. almost perfect ending! i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.total: 93% buy the dvd? hel yes! see it in the theatre? most definitely! bottom line: excellent movie for everyone! epic! i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, i know i'll be going back for seconds!

stardust another guarded review (originally written june 15, 2007)the marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so i doubt most of you have heard about it. in truth, i hadn't either (sort of). when i got the posting, i thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was transformers, one of the movies i want to see when not working so i an enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. turns out, it wasn't transformers and i had been aware of it way back when as 'that neil gaiman movie'. what is it about? well, in short, it's a gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. any more than that and i'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. if you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. rumour has it, gaiman might be something of a writer.not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. and for this one, it certainly was. this screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. so, you know the expected audience, right? i mean, with this crowd and the title of stardust, i knew what to expect.oh how sweetly wrong i was.yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom. but it was not lord of rings. it was not even another lord of the rings wannabe (ahem, eragon). it was much more intimate than all that.but, like lord of the rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. it's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. and that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick shrekism. it's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. before i go on, let's do this movie review thing.acting is, in the very least, good. it's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but i do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. michelle pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. she plays a villain, and she does the job. nothing special. rupert everett, though, he was a real jerk. that is, a great villain. peter o'toole is, well, peter frickin' o'toole -- which is marvelous. ricky gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. robert de niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. when he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. and charlie cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy i ain't never heard of.claire danes. claire danes. claire danes. i've always been of mixed opinion with her. she can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. in this, she's the former. and she is, quite literally, the star of this film. sure, her accent stumbles here and there. and, yes, she's not as good as she can be when cox isn't in the scene. however ... well, see for yourself.special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. best flying ship yet -- sorry potter. direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in new zealand. all else is top bracket.and now that that's done......the writing. oh, the writing! neil, you devil. it's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. a kingdom, a dying king, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? but gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. and, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. in the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. fantastical and real.(i wish i could talk about septimus vs tristan but i won't ruin it for you. for those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)those i spoke to afterward had the same impression i did. a great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {withheld} for this generation. the blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. you'll know when you walk out, anyway. i sincerely hope stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone i know.---forgot to add the {withheld} reveal. i'm a few years late, but ... "a great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new the princess bride for this generation." perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but i'm still confident that years form now, there will be the same "oh, i love that movie," response to this as there is now for the princess bride.

i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold.this film was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny. if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride, a classic.all the performances are outstanding, the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia...but the performance to talk about is robert de niro...in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show...if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film. guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout. the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film...nothing about the film seems forced.

i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.the plot line really is nothing like i have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. in spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. the flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. the soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv. and even though i might have known what was coming at points, i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.my one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why.

why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. it is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!for anyone that loved the princess bride, labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. robert deniro is hysterical. relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man. claire danes is fantastic as always. michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions.

"atlantis: the lost empire" was everything the previews indicated it would be. it is not often you find that. most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. not so with this one. i was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub-plots were not. the animation was not break through like "shrek" but it was good, none the less. the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them. this keeps you interested. i found myself enjoying this one. "atlantis" gets and keeps your attention. you also have to think a little bit, but not too much. once you think about it a little, you can figure out what needs to happen but you really don't know for sure how it is going to happen.the casting was also good. michael j. fox, as milo was an excellent choice. his personality fits nicely. the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner. his character reminded me of his performance in "maverick" which i also liked. i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair. her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting. it's just too bad she is a villain.over all, definitely worth you while (8 out of 10).

this highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films. i enjoyed most of it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum (although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation). james garner as the commander and leonard nimoy as the king give impressive performances.

that kid a is such a babe; this movie was no titan a.e.(of which it is in many ways modeled after) but still came off as entertaining, the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry; includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film

while there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio. if you thought think "the castaways" or "the island at the top of the world" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon.

i loved this movie! i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan, but i really enjoyed myself. the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going! this is a bit of a departure for disney, they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out)and there are no musical numbers. it is strictly action adventure. i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney, be they young or old.

to my surprise, i really enjoyed disney's latest animation installment. the film had its lows, but overall i felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. it was also pleasant to see an animated disney film that was not a musical. i was about pushed to the limits with tarzan. thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la hercules), rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.one disappointment was the animation. with all the great animated films happening outside disney studios, you would think they would move along and catch up a little. there is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities with the story of atlantis! overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.

ok, after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis: the lost empire, i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia: secret of the blue water. the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too(it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too). as an anime fan i have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in laputa, the ancient mask from princess mononoke, the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia, etc)...the plot itself i believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo(the main character in jules verne's 20k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia). as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses...as shown in the novel "lord of the flies", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. i think mylo, jean, the main character from stargate and a dozen of other "intelligent" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. as for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does), i want to state that it's a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia, it might be the artwork but i don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. as an anime fan that rated nadia as the #1 best anime i ever watched even now today. i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview. but now that i watched the movie, i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis. overall, the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing)

beautiful to watch, but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis? explore it! here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special. instead, disney reverted to the same old formula story telling.

atlantis was much better than i had anticipated. in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. although this film did demand a soid attention span at times. it was a great film for all ages. i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis.

while i have a great respect for disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what i would call "must-see". atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.atlantis is a more "mature" disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering. the world of atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. the presentation of simply atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. the inclusion of an atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.also, with the exception of some scenes involving mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that i usually associate with disney films. instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis, as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. part of this involves the atlantean "weaponry", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the toy story movies, this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years.

if you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and imagination - without the need to break into song every twelve minutes - then this is the disney movie for you! my sons loved every minute of this film, and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie. there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right. this should go down as one of the disney "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement!

atlantis is probally the best disney movie that i have seen in years. it has great action scene, magic, an intelligent and weel written script. atlantis, brings back the magic of the disney classics such as "the lion king" or "alladin". after seeing this one i'm sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be great.i recommend to you all, "alantis : the lost empire is like a breath of inspiration.9 out of 10

atlantis: the lost empire has some of the best, smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen. and i was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. i especially love don novello's voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet. too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which atlantis doesn't provide. he's average at best. halfway through the movie there's a mediocre twist. that's all. it's a great movie nevertheless. everyone should check it out.

the movie "atlantis: the lost empire" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently. parents who have had to sit through "the jungle book 2" or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.the film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories. films such as "toy story", "finding nemo", and "monsters inc." all do the same, but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney. recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video, and are sequels to an existing successful film. the quality of those films is given way to the profitability. a new era started with "atlantis" following it were "mulan", "lilo & stitch", and most recently "open range". the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past.a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. including that of young milo thatch, voiced by michael j. fox. milo is employed by a museum in washington d.c.. his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis. this was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps. after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition, milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. she takes him to her employer, a mr. whitmore. whitmore was a close friend of milo's grandfather, and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis. mr. whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything. the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch. the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis. the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis, not just the discovery of people. it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience.the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation. the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images. a feat not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two. the characters are believably human. there are some nice chase type scenes, with lots of action going on. a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get.the creativity of the writers really shines through. the culture of atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources, such as plato. the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained. believable, if by a younger audience, that magic really does exist. the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way.although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic. the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo's nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology. the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even holding roles in leadership. this is not a bad thing. it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to, rather than an all male cast.one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song, ever. a tradition that began with the first feature film, "snow white", and carried on through to "the lion king", almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs. this is great and all, what would the seven dwarfs be without "hi ho!"? after the millionth time through it'd almost be better without, but this one spares the parent. not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song. i for one am grateful.the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike. it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children.

atlantis: the lost empire is a better movie than i thought. i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. true, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. the story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named milo. milo believes in the fabled atlantis. along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. the voice cast is great. they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. the music is nothing special but likable anyway. the animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. i rate this movie 9/10.

"atlantis" is a new and right step for a disney feature. it's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like "atlantis". i didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, i don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. even in my country the reviewers weren't positive."atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of disney's greatest, even i doubt that this film ever will get "disney classic" reputation. well, that's another case. it's funny to think that this sci-fi movie was directed by the same directors as "beauty and the beast" and "hunchback" (so kirk wise and gary trousdale are trying to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, i'm just kidding).well, enough nonsense. "atlantis" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. even this film it's a pg-rated action-feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing this, he he).the story is a little predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie. the comic book-inspired animation it's suitable for the film and set's a departure from the usual disney-style. it's colorful, dark and detailed. the deep canvas sequences are pretty impressive. the film is also funny sometimes, even i more giggled than laugh through the movie. (spoilers) the characters of this film are also very likable, but unfortunately there isn't enough screen time to get to know everybody, so some characters are left behind (spoilers).the score of james newton howard is absolutely great. it's daring and exotic. (spoiler) the most impressive about this film is how they're making the atlantean language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. it's really awesome (spoilers over)the script is tight and well-written, but still the there are some questions left unanswered in the story. but luckily there are not so much of them.so do you're self a favor, don't listen to the reviewers and watch "atlantis", cause it's waiting for you...

definitely a very good idea,screenplay was just ok.could have been better,the positives are that it doesn't bore you if you're an adventure lover,a new idea about the lost world of atlantis.negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this.they should've ended up with a better adventure than this.it wasn't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime.enjoyed it a lot though,cant say that it was boring or wasn't good..a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad,like the road to el dorado.this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending.

i thought that this film was very enjoyable. i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child. therefore, i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it. it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring. if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed. this is simply an animated movie; nothing more. if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed. in closing, this is definitely not the best movie disney has made, but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received.

it is written in stone that disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. right? where? show me. because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare. while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been, it was still quite good, enjoyable, and adventurous. i had hoped for a bit more, yes, considering the subject matter, but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be. the animation quality is average, but the dialog is quite compelling, as is the story line, plot, sub-plot, and amazing creativity i found within this production. i will refrain from outlining the plot, as it has been done and done, but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy.this is, in my opinion, the best disney animated feature length film.it rates a 9.4/10 from...the fiend :.

this movie was great! it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. the animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from disney. it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no singing.the background animation was magical. it was a different level of work for the disney people. some of the characters were a little boxy, but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery. the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie. this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song.perfect. 10 out of 10.

disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. films like "tarzan" and "the emperor's new groove" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. "atlantis" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: this is still disney. the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory. perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.but despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of "the little mermaid" et al.so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. ultimately, this is an action film about atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood! if you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to james cameron's "titanic". both films feature a boat in some manner.and let's talk about love, shall we? yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one milo thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (kida, the clichéd atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting. by film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. there's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, "the little mermaid" (a good thing).you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. correct. you have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. it doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. so what does it rely on? clichés, and lots of them. every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. you have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the russian femme fatale  need i go on?i don't know why this got to anyone  i found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history? at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.but in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. the cgi animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent "titan a.e." down. speaking of characters, disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous disney outing. this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime, "nadia", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. having not seen this anime, i can't comment.with picture, there is sound. gary rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended. to me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it. if you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts (*cough*hercules*cough*).this is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. so sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.

i thought this movie was very well put together. the voice-overs were also great. i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. i would recommend this movie to anyone. it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. other scenes made me sad. and others made me glad. it is a movie any age can enjoy. from the moment milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. after i watched the movie, i read the book. it was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. it is just like the book. but go ahead and watch this movie!

here's what i knew about "atlantis" before watching it:* - it's officially disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. i'm not sure how accurate that is (i like to nitpick) but it made me curious first time i heard it described.* - the preview looked, for the most part, damn cool. evidently, it was also "too cryptic" according to some critics after the fact.* - it apparently did so badly that disney said, "screw it, let's re-release 'spy kids'".so, with all that said, how is the movie?hella-cool.i'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway, but "atlantis" goes all out. it's a throwback to all the cgi eye-candy shots in "beauty and the beast" and "aladdin", so much so that it's almost an effects animator's best-of show. the characters maybe aren't that memorable (except, perhaps, for the ship's medical officer), and the plot's a little dull, but this isn't a movie you watch for the plot.here's a controversy that bothers me. the "failure" (as in, it "only" took in, like, five-hundred-million or something; i know animators who'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that) of this movie compared to the popularity of "shrek" and "monsters inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. i don't think that's true. how do you account for the "south park" movie? what about "final fantasy"? really, the story and the artistry is everything, not the method. i don't know what disney's comeback movie will be like, but i don't think they're out of the picture yet.

two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows; veer zaara and deewaar. although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone, deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years - for whom neither indian govt. has time or sympathy nor the other side. i'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well, but let's focus on the movie. full of actors. some were stage actors like raghubir yadav, rajendra gupta, etc. amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major, acted well. akshaye khanna did his part well. there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs. i think sanjay dutt's role was most solid even though it wasn't too long. he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive. if you compare it to loc, which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions (if it had a story) - deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors. 7.5/10

this is a pretty ok film... yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast (ab, sd, tanuja). however, the actor that really impressed me here was kay kay menon (not to be confused with the singer kk). in the scene where he first meets amitabh's character, i thought that a man who can just look at ab, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. in fact, he has proved himself worthy again in sarkar, alongside ab for a second time. this guy should get more roles, he's brilliant.if you've read any of the other reviews here on imdb, you already know the plot, and i do agree that akshaye khanna's entry into pakistan was a little too easy. and the little love angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely unnecessary. but he is a fairly good actor (as seen in dch), sunjay dutt is cool to watch, always. and ab... what can i say. i don't know if i'm his biggest fan in the world, but i know i can definitely compete for the spot.an interesting watch, considering it's bollywood, although a bit inspired by hollywood oldies like "the great escape" and "bridge on the river kwai".

hello. i just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. i am a history teacher that has wayyyyy too much time on my hands. i need a life. i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain. i also found that i look a lot like jean lafitte if he were white. also, my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr. petey--"this baby can shoot a chipmunk's eye from 300 yards!!" oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in, and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work, and he drummed till the death, as if that drum would end the war altogether....but it wouldn't. well, thats all i would like to say about this movie. oh, one more thing..bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging beeyotch. that is all.

i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it.i t is not a mindless movie like ....."leathal weapon part 58" you know the one where riggs is really crazy? it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning. you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way.i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because .....duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened.don't let your doggy take a shower!!!

of the films of the young republic few in number as they are the buccaneer (1958)stands out as a finely crafted film. charleton heston excels in his portrayal of old hickory's defence of new orleans with a thrown together force of militia, regulars and pirates promised a reprieve.after christmas 1814 peninsula veterans led by sir edward packenham, the duke of wellington's brother in law bore down on the city of new orleans. andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay.charlton heston projects jackson's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power of command. yet there are a few colorful comic relief. with the might of the english lioness about to pounce, a young blond haired voluteer from new orleans asks: i guess the ruckus is about to start.the battle was about to rage but not for long. true to form the british marched straight into withering american fire. in less than a few minutes an attempt to reconquer lost north american territories had been foiled.the battle scene in this movies lasts slightly longer than the actual battle itself.there are colorful side stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory.

this movie has great stars in their earlier years: ingor stevens never looked prettier; yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte, conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the united states. charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted. it's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each other--sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run. i have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen, i love it every time!

the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march. a very good film indeed. hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner. he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies. charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius. however, the movie did tend to get a little long in places. it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version. still, it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once.

taken in the context of the time it was made, i found this a worthwhile movie. while the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. in addition, i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure. who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey. the perfect touch of comedy. well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.

during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b. demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included. it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans, louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for it's pirate connections. when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper. paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !

sure, the history in this movie was "hollywoodized"--but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses. lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british, not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling, which caused his sailing to galveston; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero *or* a swashbuckler. but who cares? this is one movie that's sheer entertainment--and face it, we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor. brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.

if you're at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, new orleans/early 19th century american history, or yul brynner, see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. don't be put off by various lacklustre reviews. my reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte. while not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans' history, and the love-hate relationship between the "respectable" citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons. don't worry about what the film doesn't do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of new orleans', and america's, most intriguing historical figures.

this interesting feature has a very fine story-line, rather colorful characters and a very steady pace. it also incorporates a plot device from "reap the wild wind", and since cecil b. deille directed that and his son-in-law anbthony quinn directed this film from his preparations, that can hardly be a coincidence. it works in both cases, i must report. the unusual set-up tells the viewer that barataria, an island ruled by jean lafitte is built upon piracy, but during the war of 1812, and before, he has always refrained from bothering united states' vessels. now general andrew jackson has been charged with defending nearby new orleans with only 12,000 men against 60,000 british imperial redcoats and 60 ships. lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger force; he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a strategic landing spot to the u.s. forces. there are other factors at work in the story-line; pirate bonnie brown and her father want to attack u.s. ships and do so in defiance of lafitte's orders, leaving a boy alive without knowing they have missed an eyewitness. when his testimony finally comes out, jackson cannot grant what lafitte asks; but lafitte supports him anyway and in the fog, the pirates and jackson rout the british and he sails away to whatever destiny awaits a man who had genius and statesmanship but not fortune. the cast of this colorful and physically-lovely film are skilled indeed. yul brynner has one of his best roles as the pirate king, inger stevens is beautiful; as the girl he loves, charles boyer has many good lines as his adviser, powerful lorne greene is a rival, e.g. marshall the governor, and claire bloom is charismatic as bonnie brown. others in the cast include ted de corsia, douglass dumbrille, george mathews, henry hull as jackson's adviser, bruce gordon, onslow stevens, robert f. simon, henry brandon, fran jeffries, and leslie bradley, among others. the music by elmer bernstein is very memorable, and the 1938 script remade here had only to be freshened a bit. the shiny cinematography was the work of veteran loyal griggs, the set decoration was supplied by albert nozaki, hal pereira and walter tyler, with set decoration by sam comer and roy moyer and costumes by edith head, john jensen and ralph jester. nellie manley did the elaborate hairstyles and wally westmore the difficult makeup. the film contains quite a bit of good adventure-level dialogue and a very strong climactic battle scene. charlton heston, as as andrew jackson, prepared to play the part of an elder general and then discovered the man was young at the time of the battle; but he is often effective, grey-haired or not, especially in his exchanges with henry hull as mr. peavey. this is an exciting and well-mounted entertainment, which looks exactly as if c.b. demille had completed his production; it is a beautiful and nearly a very-fine motion picture.

i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60's. it's a typical hollywood history epic, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what, it's an entertaining movie and a good looking film. cecil b. demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. his son-in-law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again. demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer/actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project. also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky, cinematographer loyalk griggs, assistant director francisco day, 2nd unit director arthur rosson, art directors walter tyler and hal pereira, set directors sam comer and ray moyer, costume designers edith head, john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer's only oscar nomination. a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson. also in the cast are charles boyer, e.g. marshall, lorne greene, claire bloom and inger stevens. at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes. i would give it a 7.5 out of 10.

honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with. in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent. not only that you've got to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. it actually requires skill. not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days. and yet, they only have two seasons of it! bull..they need to bring this show back!! although, they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn. he was great.but seriously, it was an amazing show. you never knew who would be going when. and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself! it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to!bring back the mole!!!! bring back the mole!!!!

quite simply the best reality show ever made. the first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on hulu. i challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it. i guarantee you will finish watching the season. then i guarantee that you will watch season 2. other quick reasons to watch it: 1. anderson cooper is hilarious 2. the locations in europe are awesome 3. the games are mentally challenging 4. it's very interactive 5. in one episode a player responds to another player's desperate, "i'm trying as hard as i can!" with an equally desperate, "not necessarily." can you figure out...who is the mole?

jake speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead. unfortunately that's something that really taints the entire movie and it's a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting, if derivative, premise. although it's genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like 'romancing the stone' albeit in reverse. it's not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character (who happens to chronicle his own adventures) leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures.when a young woman goes missing in paris, her sister margaret (played by the appealing karin kopins) gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed (wayne crawford) and his sidekick dennis (dennis christopher) who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid (john hurt) and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice (roy london). that's the plot  it's not labyrinthine and it's not complicated but the story that it tells doesn't require great depth.the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it's certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces (whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions) and there are certainly some quite funny lines. however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome. this, however, may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawford's performance it becomes harder to really care what happens. now i don't know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he's simply not a good actor (as i haven't seen him in much else) but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage, indiana jones and jack colton.this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake (unfortunately it never convinces). dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish  almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman. he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film. sid is no moriarty (he is presented as jake's nemesis from a number of his previous adventures / books) but he is always fun to watch.jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as 'night of the comet' (a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand) and almost succeeds but misses  which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series.i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good.

jake speed (1986) was an amusing parody of indiana jones and other adventurer films that were popular during the eighties. wayne crawford stars as jake speed, an adventurer who's always battling evil doers wherever he goes. with his assistant desmond floyd (dennis christopher) they globe trot looking for some action (and some decent story lines). the duo meet a young woman named margaret (karen kopins) who's sister has been kidnapped by an evil white slaver trader (john hurt). can she find and convince jake and desmond to help her rescue her sibling?a sappy and cheesy film that doesn't pretend to be something that it's not. i have to give this one a recommendation. that's if you enjoy movies that like to have fun and for those who don't take everything at face value.recommended.

i know the film snobs are snorting. but if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b-movie jungle, try "jake speed".a little thin at times, but its one-liners and the location more then make up for this. john hurt(god love him), seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver. the nemesis of crawfords, jake speed. he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide. crawford and dennis christopher( jakes sidekick) are a good team,although you do wonder why they both put up with each other.however ,together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that, if you can get over yourself for a moment, you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide.the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor.i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy,or bogging down the movie by trying too hard. not every movie has to be the latest "citizen kane". and trust me,wells was an original. so lets remember that sometimes, movies are for fun.not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically. but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero's live in a celluloid dimension.

ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from? according to 'jake speed' they are based on real people, living out the adventures they write about and publish. this movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and skimpy clothes at the worst. the language is is also not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. this is a 'austin powers' look at 'indian jones', without the over-the-top antics of michael myers. i highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range.

most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who don't are being too critical or maybe expected something else. this is one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows on you, and has it all. i just got it on dvd and 20 years later it still does not disappoint, having plenty of action, drama, romance, and even comedy. add to that the great car chases, automatic weapon shootouts and lots of stuff blowing up and you have a fun, edge of your seat experience! you will even be humming or whistling the main theme song for days after seeing this. you can watch this movie with your wife/gf and you will both enjoy it lots. the premise is that of a paperback book hero, like doc. savage, really existing and helping people fight evil so he can write the story is almost true to life here. the actor jake speed is also a director, producer and writer of many films. in this film jake speed (the character) is an indiana jones adventurer type, he usually uses his head to get out of sticky situations but will sometimes resorts to brute firepower (yay!,and sheer dumb luck too!). keep an eye out for his one "james bond" hi-tech equipment, the ultimate road warrior suv dropping out of the sky.the heroine is the very beautiful young love interest from the early jim carey vampire movie "once bitten" and here she is a little older and still a knockout even compared to her teenage blonde little sister.the bad guys are "real bad" men and are the worst lowlife villainous scum you love to hate. the ending is just perfect and can stand alone or invite a sequel, sadly never made - but you can just imagine what would happen next!you have to see this movie just because it will entertain and amuse you and that's worth the price of a ticket.

i enjoyed this movie as a kid when it came out, and to this day still do. a simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight out of paperback lore. it has actors that were more recognizable back in the day. this shouldn't keep the viewer from giving it a whirl. wayne crawford stars as the main character jake speed. sure, it might bite from certain elements of romancing the stone, and indiana jones. but this movie is done well enough to keep it out of the cellar. i am surprised not too many people know about it. it must have been overshadowed by other movies in the theaters back in '86. i watched it back then on cable tv. it might be hard to find since it's out of print on both vhs and dvd. i managed to get a dvd from ebay at less than 8 bucks! cool flick.

"jake speed" is a fine movie with a wonderful message. it has its flaws of course. at times it's a little slow. it introduces its villain too far into the story. it's action is paced at the rate of a snail's heartbeat. it has a z-grade cast (although i've always admired the work of karen kopins, who has the straight-laced good looks of sandra bullock).but with all this going against it, "jake speed" really is inspiring, thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford(who plays the title role) and andrew lane.why do i find it so inspiring? because it says to me "hey, why not try to be a good person."the story is essentially a "stranger in a strange land" premise, that is good-and-heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people. jake is more than a boy scout. he's more than a knight in shining armor. jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, mean and evil world.it's because of this that "jake speed" really needed to be a hit. it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world.imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people. i'm not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex, but that it would be nice if more movies such as "jake speed" would get a chance. ("due south," a tv show about a canadian mountie, is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainment.)sure, "jake speed" has violence, blood and guns, but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you'll beat the forces of evil every time. 10/14/99

this film is harmless escapist fun. something the recent tomb raider film lacked. i can't wait to get the dvd. how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know. anything with karen kopins in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two!

the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed. i've seen it at least 10 times. this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. the film begins with margaret (karen kopins) trying to find her sister. her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing. along comes jake speed (wayne crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. jake speed is a hero. he doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. his partner (dennis christopher) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels. this film is a great adventure. it's hilarious, it's action-packed, it's just great. i guess it's a cult film with a very small cult following. crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one-liners that you'll never forget. kopins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick, respectively. john hurt, the guy who's stomach blew up in alien, plays the devilish, pervertish villian which just adds to the fun. in many ways, this film is similar to indiana jones, in some ways it's similar to james bond films. maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it's title is, it's a very enjoyable film.

one of my favorite films for a number of years was "last action hero"; unfortunately, arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now i can't bear any film he may had a hand in.the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last...hero; so i was pleased to find it on dvd, so i could watch these themes played out so well.despite the "plot-within-the-plot" involving white slavery during an african nation's civil war, this is not an action movie. the plot that the "plot-within-a-plot" is within, is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve: is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film, and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this. the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional "adventure-story" universe. that's actually a rich theme, the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film's amiable and campy sense of humor.there are weaknesses to the film - primarily it's cinematography, which makes the film look like a tv show. and the pacing does sag on occasion.but i really like these characters, and i enjoy the adventure they live, however silly. and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel.holds up under multiple viewings -m good show!

as a young teenager at the time, airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their "cowboys and indians" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions.in many ways, the show was essentially knight rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference.but in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from knight rider, street hawk, the a-team and other action shows of the time. for one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by stringfellow hawke's possession of airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his mia brother, st john). and then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s cold war context, complete with soviet espionage and central american dictators, not to mention the enemy within. sure, the a-team constantly referred back to vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. with airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on.with hindsight, the cold war setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. but that's really not the point. airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a tv budget to boot.for uk readers, dmax (sky channel 155) have just started (jan 2008) daily re-runs of airwolf. set your sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the uk.

one of my favorite shows in the 80's. after the first season, it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast. deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine's character go at it with each other. the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season. unfortunately during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show. when it went to usa, it was disgusting!!!

i used to watch this show when i was a little girl. although i don't remember much about it, i must say that it was a pretty good show. also, i don't think i've seen every episode. however, if you ask me, it was still a good show. i vaguely remember the theme song. everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was great. the performances were top-grade, too. i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though i don't think i've seen every episode. now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.

airwolf the movie, a variation on the original 2 part pilot, yet the movie although shorter, does contain extra footage unseen in the 2 hour pilot the pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie where as a pilot movie is normally the same (2 parter combined) but the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there.worth a look, even if you have the season 1 dvd set, i'd still pick up a copy of the "movie" it's still in some shops like virgin, woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores, although it generally needs ordering, but it saves needing to buy online (as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping) but if you look around airwolfs in storesairwolf was truly 1 of the 80's most under rated shows.a full size airwolf is currently being re-built for a helicopter museum :) info and work in progress pictures are over at http://airwolf.org also with airwolf mods for flashpoint and flight sim games it seams she's finally here to stay :)

so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father). wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.question - does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin. i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf.

the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen. the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing. i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel. or at least a remake. if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy.

legend of dragoon is one of those little-known games that people either love or hate. some people claim it's far too similar to other games, namely the final fantasy series--which is understandable, since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy. honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that, as i'm not very familiar with the ff games.i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form, but every time you attack, you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time. not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage. even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button-mashing. if you don't want to attack, you can always guard, which not only cuts any damage taken in half, but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions.the fmvs are quite well-done, about the same quality as final fantasy 8's. however, the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard. they're nice, but they could have been--and honestly, should have been--better. the translation as well leaves something to be desired. not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions, but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass.another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters--one dies, and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves. while the death of the one character is often said to have no point, it makes you realize early on that the characters, while heroes, are still just as mortal as the next person. the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats, so the transition game play-wise is fairly smooth. perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest, shana. she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing, pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration. while you can use her in your party, she is insanely weak--i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like, as i disliked her so much i never used her. the character rose, by contrast, is probably my favorite female character in any game ever. she's no wimp, and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful. meru is quite strong as well, while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat.the character designers were, as most are, inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever, and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits. seriously, no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters. but i will give them props, as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries.i can't comment much on the plot, as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next. i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself, or my gaming style.all in all, it's a very enjoyable game. it has its flaws, but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters.

this game is one of the best rpg. fist, it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system (you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack, you can transform into dragoon, the special attack, the magic...). the script is very good. characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support, as happened in several games of final fintasy series. i got bored of that dialogs about past, when you just want to go on with the game's story. ambientation is a jewel on this game, it combines middle-age fantasy with futuristic science fiction. it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, i like them more than other in other modern games (we can't remember that legend of the dragoon is 8 years now). then, map is huge, there are all kinds of places an enemies. finally, music is not the best game muse i have heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.

i second the motion to make this into a movie, it would be great!! i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game. i have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. final fantasy eat your heart out!! this should be made into a movie!!!!! if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie, please contact me. i would love to help with that project any day. the graphics are great for ps1 and even make you forget it is ps1 most of the time. the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.

i remember this game. it was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day i decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. i stared in awe at it, since it was the first ever game for the ps1 that i owned that had 4 discs. when i played it, i couldn't put the controller down, seriously.the storyline of this game is so good and twisted, it's almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline, and that is hard to accomplish. when you play the game, you get so involved with the characters it's unbelievable that it's only a ps1 game, as it feels like a movie. and i believe it should be made into a movie.too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it, as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves, with a 50% off sign sitting on it, trying to sell. well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends, and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good. heck, that is how i got into final fantasy vii, looking in a catalog, and finding it. but this is different than final fantasy.legend of dragoon, is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games, surprisingly. i wouldn't be surprised if it was made by square enix but it's not. hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series, or the dragon quest series, but this one is. but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised, which it should be.graphics are pretty good for a ps1 game, but what can you expect from it? it's ps1 man, made in 1999. story i have already mentioned is amazing, almost beats vii. characters are a amazing, you get involved so much with them, and their actions.a definite 10 out of 10. definitely deserved more praise, and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix.

i absolutely love this game to death. ever since i was 9 years old (i am now 15). it has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms! i am still waiting for a remake, prequel, or a sequel to this spectacular video game. you play as dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero. on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights. you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element. such as fire, darkness, water/ice, thunder/lightning, earth, light, and wind. there are also items known as dragoon spirits, which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. dragons, wizards, creatures called winglies and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action-packed thrills and excitement. one of my all time favorite games, the legend of dragoon!

(no spoilers, just plot details) i can't understand such hatred for this episode. you want to watch a bad episode of smallville? watch subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. tom welling gives a good performance (i don't say that very often), and michael rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. the martian manhunter, who previously appeared in "static", returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone, and if clark wants to return to his universe, he must kill him. an overall great episode, with good acting and a decent pace.

this episode is a bit confusing. some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginning!clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of fairview mental institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero. clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head. delusional. he also find some things that are unusual: martha's married to lionel; lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and lana is devoted to clark. but he finds one familiarity; someone else who's devoted to clark: chloe. he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of smallville. and the doctor is an escapee from the phantom zone.this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called "normal again" where buffy begins to have vivid-daydreams about a mental asylum. the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a figment of her imagination and that she was, in fact, crazy. her parents were still married, they still lived in la, her friends didn't exist, angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called dawn. demons and vampires also didn't exist. both episodes are a bit sad because doctors aren't just telling the characters that it's all a figment of her imagination but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. it's nice, though, to have a sense of reality every once in a while, but we watch these shows to escape from reality. it's again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges.

though derivative, "labyrinth" still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor. it's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of "truth, justice, and the american way" on a weekly basis with very little variation. his performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie, was quite believable.welling rose to the occasion marvelously.as always, michael rosenbaum, as the "handicapped" lex, delivered, as did kristen kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed lana. allison mack, the ever-present chloe, also scored as a slightly "off-her-rocker" version.the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama.

while in the barn of kent farm with shelby waiting for chloe, clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with dr. hudson. the psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional, believing that he has come from krypton and had superpowers. clark succeeds to escape, and meets lana, martha and lex that confirm the words of dr. hudson. only chloe believe on his words, but she is also considered insane. clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and origin."labyrinth" is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of "smallville". the writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from krypton. the annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified. my vote is nine.title (brazil): "labirinto" ("labyrinth")

you better see this episode from the beginning, because if you start to watch it any later, you will be confused as to what is happening to clark's life.yet, that is the twist; clark is stuck in an alternate reality. lana is devoted to him. lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss clark in the pilot of the series. martha is married to lionel. about the only constant is his most loyal friend chloe, who still believes in who he is. and, oh yeah, he doesn't have any superpowers. he is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers, and is ridiculed for believing so. aside from chloe, there is one mysterious figure who believes in clark: a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution, who believes he is from mars.clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality, and not get brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist, who is in fact the fourth phantom zone escapee.this episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking. plus, it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of "smallville" episode.

this was one of the highlights of st:tng's semi-forgettable second season, before they 'grew up' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond. this was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher, but was also the continuation of data's search for his 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. still one of my favorite episodes.on a side-note, i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst(after teri hatcher's character) before being rudely interrupted by lt worf. i remember watching this episode 'first-run' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey/marvel girl.it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is...

"once upon a time there was a charming land called france.... people lived happily then. the women were easy and the men indulged in their favorite pastime: war, the only recreation of kings which the people could enjoy." the war in question was the seven year's war, and when it was noticed that there were more corpses of soldiers than soldiers, recruiters were sent out to replenish the ranks. and so it was that fanfan (gerard philipe), caught tumbling a farmer's daughter in a pile of hay, escapes marriage by enlisting in the regiment d'aquitane...but only by first believing his future as foretold by a gypsy, that he will win fame and fortune in his majesty's uniform and will marry the king's daughter. alas, adeline (gina lollobrigida) is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiment's recruiting sergeant. when fanfan charges away from the recruits, saber in hand to rescue a carriage under attack, who should be inside but the marquise du pompadour and...the king's daughter. he now is convinced he will marry high, despite the extremely low-cut blouses adeline wears. she, in turn, will soon discover her own love for fanfan. we're in the middle of an irreverent movie of fanfan's destiny, the ribald adventures of a sword-fighting scamp and rogue. there are escapes from hangings, swordfights on tile roofs, blundering battles, romantic escapes and more joyous derring do than you can imagine. what fanfan lacks in polish he makes up for in irreverence and enthusiasm. he's a quick stepping swordsman and a fast-talking lover, but with such naïve belief in his destiny and such an optimistic nature, how can we not like him? gerard philipe was an iconic stage and screen actor (who francois truffaut disparaged constantly in the pages of cahiers du cinema). he did most of his own stunts. he was handsome, athletic, graceful and charismatic. men admired him and women dreamed about him. he was dead at 36, seven years after fanfan, of liver cancer. all of france mourned. gina lollobrigida as adeline holds her own. it's not those low-cut blouses that do her acting. she's sharp, passionate, not quite innocent and no one's fool. fanfan la tulipe just sings along with endless satiric action, pointed situations and good nature. not to mention amusing, acerbic dialogue. after adeline has taken steps to save fanfan from hanging, she meets the king in his private quarters. "give me your pretty little hand," he says. "but my heart belongs to fanfan," says adeline. "who asks for your heart?" says the king, "all i ask for is a little pleasure." "i'm a proper girl," says adeline. says the king, "you owe my esteem to your merits. you love fanfan? then thank me. my whims enable you to show the greatest proof of your love, by betraying for his sake the loyalty you have sworn him." now this is clever, funny stuff. jean-luc godard, francois truffaut and the rest of the new wave gang tended to detest popular movies as mere entertainment (and they personalized their attacks). fanfan la tulipe and its director, christian-jacques, were among their prime targets. they probably missed the point of fanfan, which is a very funny satire on the pointlessness of armies and war. how much better it must have seemed to make movies of angst which only fellow cineastes could appreciate. thank goodness some of them, truffaut and chabrol, for example, outgrew this childish condescension and came to recognize that a good movie is a good movie, whether the masses like it or just the cognoscenti. a smart person who enjoys movies can appreciate any, if the movies are well made. those who condescend to a movie based on its degree of popularity are as self-demeaning as those who brag they've never read harry potter. jean-luc godard, eat your heart out. viva fanfan!

the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago. i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional, aimed at a long obsolete target. hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all, basil rathbone, crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire. after a while you don't notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda, both versions. gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol, the other obvious candidate at the time. the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it.

gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie, funny, tender, brave and lover.he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece, as much by the other actors (gina lollobrigida:miaoooou!!) as by the story or the rhythm. never boring, always creating new emotions: for me, the best french movie of all time.

the men can slaver over lollo, if they like (or her lollos--she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french), but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe, who is not only beautiful but can act. don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple, dashing story of love and war, in which all is fair, they are not needed. all you need know is that, at the beginning of the film, lollobrigida reads philipe's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king. thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running, jumping, and swordplay.on the minus side, the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying, and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts. and of course the non-french-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la, such as: virtuous girl: i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan. seducer: my dear, what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle?

i remember this movie from the 50s when i was in college. it is one of the funniest satires of american westerns that i have ever seen. i'm only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd. it is a real treat.

this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i've scheduled for viewing during this christmas season: the others (in order of viewing) were the uninspired the black tulip (1964; from the same director as this one but not nearly as good), the surprisingly effective lady oscar (1979; which had originated as a japanese manga!) and the splendid cartouche (1962). actually, i had watched this one not too long ago on late-night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it, so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around (also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion).incidentally, fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore-mentioned cartouche: not just cast and crew members (producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine, cinematographer christian matras, actor noel roquevert) but plot-wise as well  in fact, the hero is a womanizing soldier (jean-paul belmondo's cartouche had also had a brief military spell) who's loved by a fiery girl (in this case, gypsy gina lollobrigida) while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love (here, it's none other than the king's daughter)! as in the later film, too, fanfan (an ideally cast gerard philipe who, ironically, is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 years' time) is flanked by two fun-loving yet cowardly men (one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine's own father) and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks (the ageing roquevert, with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl)!; for the record, lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film, rene clair's delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit (1952).fanfan proved to be a big box-office hit on its home-ground and even copped a surprising (but well-deserved) best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris (1951), detective story (1951), othello, umberto d. and viva zapata! in fact, its popularity ensured its re-release in a computer-colored version (presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black-and-white product with a ten-foot pole) and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant; being obviously a foreign-language title, there's also the dubious choice of an english-dubbed soundtrack but, even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering, when all is said and done, there's simply no substitute for the original! fanfan la tulipe (a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour) contains about as much comedy as (the expected) action and romance; while some may find this overwhelming, i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and, on the whole, this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski's equally droll the adventures of gerard (1970). that said, the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise (particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent) and the film itself rather adult at times (with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout) when viewed back-to-back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now; the climax, then is quite ingenious: the enemy forces (who, amusingly, are made to speak in speeded-up gibberish!) are depleted by our heroic trio alone, much to the king's amazement who, as portrayed by marcel herrand  best-known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne''s children of paradise (1945)  is himself something of a lecher.p.s. an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian-jaque's promising champagne for savages (1964) for months now but, despite programming it three times already (with a tentative fourth one slated for next week), they have yet to show it; even so, i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile (equally culled from late-night italian tv screenings): the three-hour epic la chartreuse de parme (1948; also starring gerard philippe), the second twin (1967) and the legend of frenchie king (1971; with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale).

it was released in france on dvd several years ago--i wish it would be re-released with english subtitles. do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews. gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. he sets off to join the army and goes to war. his love, however, is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her. i won't spoil the end. gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.

this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe. portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe, the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry king louis xv's daughter! problem is, la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan...propelled by good sword fights, cavalcades, and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments. the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought. look out for noel roquevert, a traditional heavy in french films, trying to steal la lollo, making himself a nuisance, and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo's hand! and what a gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven king louis xv! that is not all: so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in 1952! the film may have come out that year but its verve, cheek, superb narration, immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. i would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! do see it!

the superb star quality of gerard philipe, who died way too young, leaps from the screen in this witty, funny, sly swashbuckling comedy with plenty of sword fencing and knockabout antics. charmingly loopy in its' storytelling, impossible to resist. a sweet romantic comedy with a very young gina lollobrigida as the love interest. a movie one will remember with great affection.

"fanfan la tulipe" is still gerard philippe's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the french cinema in the 1955-1965 years.it made gina lollobrigida a star (lollobrigida and philippe would team up again in rené clair"s "belles de nuit" the same year."fanfan la tulipe" is completely mad,sometimes verging on absurd .henri jeanson's witty lines -full of dark irony- were probably influenced by voltaire and "candide" .antimilitarism often comes to the fore:"these draftees radiate joie de vivre -and joie de mourir when necessary (joy of life and joy of death)""it becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors" "you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me, king louis xv complains,but no matter ,let's wait for the next time."a voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride:height of irony,it's a genuine historian who speaks!christian-jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo :accelerated.remake in 2003 with vincent perez and penelope cruz.i have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place.

holes, originally a novel by louis sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. starring sigourney weaver as the warden, shia labeouf as stanley, and khleo thomas as zero, the roles were very well casted, and the actors portrayed their roles well.the film had inter-weaving storylines that all led up to the end. the main storyline is about stanley yelnats and his punishment of spending a year and a half at camp greenlake. the second storyline is about sam and kate barlow. this plot deals with racism and it is the more deep storyline to the movie. the third is about elya yelnats and madame zeroni, which explains the 100-year curse on the yelnats family. in my opinion, these storylines were weaved together very well.contrary to many people's beliefs, i think that you do not have to have read the book to understand the movie. the film is reasonably easy to understand.the acting in the film was well done, especially shia labeouf (stanley), khleo thomas (zero), sigourney weaver (the warden), and jon voight (mr. sir). the other members of d-tent, jake smith (squid), max kasch (zig-zag), miguel castro (magnet), byron cotton (armpit), and brenden jefferson (x-ray), enhanced the comic relief of the movie. however, the best parts were with zero and stanley, who made a great team together.although holes is a disney movie, it deals with some serious issues such as racism, shootings, and violence. the film's dramatization at some points is very well done.i would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether they have read the book or not. you shouldn't miss it.

"holes" is my all-time favorite movie! so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on dvd this upcoming september. i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were. the director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form. also, all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters, especially max kasch as zigzag. props to all those involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, i definitely recommend it for everyone to see!

i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. it brings out the child in everyone. i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? louis sachar thats who. although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. for example caveman/stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. weight wise and height wise but zigzag/ricky was taller and armpit/theodore was bigger. also x-ray/rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't. the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. i especially like the work of the boys though. like squid/alan who was played by jake m.smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. jake m.smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes. so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.

this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice. the directing and editing was great. i may look up the book that this was adapted from, it must have been great. (i liked it.) sigourney weaver, jon voight, and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch! henry winkler and nathan davis were not seen enough, but were fun when they were onscreen. the kids at the camp couldn't have been better. (as i said, i liked it!)

you got to go and dig those holes. holes only leaves troble, which makes a movie so good. disney has done it again.shia labeouf should be nominated for best actor for his performance as stanley yelnats. he has alredy won the daytime emmy for best actor in a comedy series (even stevens). holes is one of the best movies in 2003.

i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting. best of all it left out the usual sex and violence (they're getting old) inserted in many movies. the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest. the acting was also superb.

this movie is one i strongly recommend. it's about a boy, stanley yelnats (shia lebeouf) who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake, a boys' detention center. there, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter. while there, he meets the other boys of the camp (zero, magnet, armpit, squid, x-ray, and zigzag). all of them are digging, not to 'build charactor', but to find outlaw kate barlow's treasure. throughout the movie (and book) stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. i give this movie a 9.5, because, i am very picky when it comes to books to movies, (i want the movie to follow the book exactly). but, still it did real well.

holes is a wonderful film to see. it has good messages in in, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. i highly recommend it to anyone. i still say the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a run for its money. also, khleo thomas plays zero. that really adds to it!!!! lol!!!

what a great movie! this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. i was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disney's live productions crews have churned out.this movie is an absolute joy. the child stars were just that; professional, quality actors. i am most impressed with the quality of this movie.sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. siobhan fallon was wonderful as the star's mother.i won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb! this work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted. they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. while the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. it was best that way.this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch.it gets a 9/10 from...the fiend :.

i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic! of course, being my busy self, i didn't get chance to see the movie in theaters. holes was at the drive-in just out of town but, alas, we were just too busy. i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me! they all said it was good but i've read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried.suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came. it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit. my sister, who is 9, and i watched it and absolutely loved it! i then took it to the other people i was babysitting's house and their kids, 9 and 4, liked it too. even my parents loved it and they're deffinately movie critics. overall, i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast! this movie should be on your top 5 "to see" list!!!!

'holes' was a great movie. disney made the right choice. every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it. everyone casted was fit for the part they had, and shia labeouf really has a future with acting. sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden, she was exactly how i imagined her. everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it'.

my wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read it to several of her classes. it never sounded all that interesting to me, though, and i bought the dvd figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley.the first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and i found myself thinking that i was right. it starts off a bit slow and i have to admit that i was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it. boy, am i glad i did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. i would most certainly watch this again!the casting was very good. since i haven't read the book, i can't vouch for accuracy, but i have to say that jon voight was truly delightful. you liked the characters you were supposed to like, hated the ones you were supposed to hate, and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny.i can see how some folks might not like this movie. it is tedious at times, especially in the beginning. all the flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story). once the story starts to come together at the end, though, i think you're paid back in spades for your patience. when all is said and done, i think this is a very good movie - 8/10.

i found about the movie "holes" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney, that both kids and adults both got into the story. folks, let me tell you i wasn't disappointed. "holes" is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats, a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. it was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it. it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr. sir. now that i've seen the movie, i have to read the book. most recommended!

more than just a "kids' movie", "holes" looks at how past incidents still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. when teenager stanley yelnats iii (shia leboeuf) gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to dig all day long, he discovers a number of things about the camp, and his personal connection to it. through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand this better when you see the movie). leboeuf does a pretty good job, as do the other cast members: sigourney weaver, jon voight, tim blake nelson, henry winkler, patricia arquette, and eartha kitt. a very interesting movie.

holes is an awesome movie. i love it a lot and it's one of my favorite films. it's one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn't cheesy. holes is generally a very cool motion picture. i wish disney would make more pictures like it. holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool. don't get the wrong idea, i don't mean to bad mouth disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and that's okay. children deserve to have their entertainment too. but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. but not with holes. it's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny. really, it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to.holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this.

this film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. the film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. the actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. they use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. the graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. there is no such thing as a yellow spotted lizard, for example. the camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book. all of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film. overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon

holes (2003, dir andrew davis) when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing, he is sent to 'camp green lake'. at this camp, the warden, and her two henchman, mr. sir and dr. pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole. but for what reason? stanley plans to find out.i never really had any intention in watching 'holes', and i must admit, i only really watched the film, because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf, but even if you are not a fan of him, then it doesn't matter. 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy. the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past. these are not distracting and really gives a great back story. all the cast are great. the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy. shia labeouf shows that even at 17, he can act without any flaws. this is one disney film, you definitely would enjoy as a family."i learn from failure." - stanley yelnats iii (henry winkler)

louis sachar's compelling children's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger. it's got murder, racism, facial disfigurement and killer lizards.tightly plotted, it's a multi-layered, interlinking story that spans history to reveal stanley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes. it races from latvia's lush greenness to the pock-marked camp green lake (hint: there's no lake and no green).disney's first success is re-creating the novel's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without gloss. the other plus is in the casting. rising star shia labeouf (charlie's angels 2, project greenlight) might not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean-cut hero. the rest of the cast is filled out equally well, from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm-turned-bank robber to henry winkler as stanley's dad. the downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end.

a disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. "holes" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. for the first time events are not explained in details. the flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. i must admit that at first i was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. but soon i realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (one example where caveman is forbidden to teach zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). "holes" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. a must watch!

loved the movie. loved the two families crossing paths in history. only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family's line continue? he is madame zeroni's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children? hmmmmmmmmm. never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit? even with the mistakes in the movie. just loved it. the acting was great. not sure where the story was with mr. sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. the other "counseler" did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up.

this is one of my favorite films of all time. i read the book and liked it, but this movie expands on everything the book made famous. the acting is fantastic, especially from jon voight, who plays mr. sir, a very evil character. this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout, until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending. i also love the way this is directed, by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanley's ancestors' stories. the story was written by louis sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for film, and andrew davis does a great job directing it. i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.

seriously i loved this film..i had started to read the book and i loved it...the way everything was set up and everything had a purpose...i think this film did so well was because louis sachar wrote the screenplay..and of course andrew davis directed it...shia lebouf gives a great performance for his first film...the storyline is very cool and interesting...there's humor, heart and intensity...it is very similar to the book..i find this film to be not the least bit boring...i absolutely loved it...and i encourage anyone to read the book..all in all this film is very well put together and carefully crafted...two thumbs up for me in every single way

in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that oscar is), "holes" has credibility. i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material. if the author can't write a screenplay to save their life, then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it. aside from that, this review is about "holes".the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within. (1) louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay. i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity. some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums. (2) the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character. he "dug" himself into the role. i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion. (3) to ratchet up the suspense a bit, andrew davis was brought in. this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast. he also can make steven seagal smash some heads. as for this film, he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes. in other words, he can make an "action-packed" movie and make it well even if "action" isn't the main genre isn't "action". (4) my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr. sir. sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. when voight uttered the line "once upon a time...", i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny. he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent. (5) tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script. this is probably the second best role i have seen him in (second only to 'o brother where art thou?'). (6) i love the choice of settings for the movie. i didn't know california was that dry or that barren. i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading. (7) the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water. one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day. (8) the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well. sigourney weaver, henry winkler, khleo thomas, jake m. smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well. great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble. (9) i like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away. when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats, it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie. (10) disney pictures (not touchstone, disney!!) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films. it was palatable for me and i am a college student. the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was "something wicked this way comes" and "holes" possibly exceeds it (like the election in 2000, it's still to close to call). disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it. ten reasons give a score of ten!all in all, "holes" is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year (granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material?). in terms of being a movie from a book i have read, this ranks behind "fight club" on my list (which is on top). for being a film i saw in 2003, this is in the top five (somewhere behind "mystic river"). compared against "harry potter", stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter's nose. everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains. here ends my rant!

i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today. i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch! i am so glad i saw it, and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time. this movie is so wonderful! it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe. the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. some people have said this is a kids movie. i disagree - it may be made by disney and many characters are children, but i am 23 and i loved it! there were moments when my spine tingled. the story is unlike any other film these days, full of adventure. i have just ordered the book from amazon, can't wait!

holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. i didn't think i would like a children's novel; plus, the other couple of books i was forced to read for the class were really bad. but, to my surprise, i absolutely loved holes. it really is one of the most perfectly written novels i've ever read. i think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. everyone who reads it, i think, will walk away a better person. while i can't quite say that for the film, i am happy to say that they got it mostly right. i don't think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down. it is an intelligent story, and it's very well told. i think it moves a tad too quickly. the novel takes more time in developing the characters. and the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register. the interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel. and the ending, which ties together all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. it's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film. it works a lot better. i also don't like the multitude of pop songs. i wish disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks. the cast is across-the-board excellent, from the young kids to the old pros. jon voight is especially great. not quite sure why we need catwoman and the fonze, though. 9/10.

i couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short "not bad" commentary. this movie is much better than just not bad. the acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends. the movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well. the double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler. i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later. if you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then check out "holes." my 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them. how many movies can you say that about?

and i'm serious! truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching. what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. this film has many elements that make it what it is:1. a unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. brilliant actors. adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. breathtaking scenery. and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. louis sachar! the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down. he makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. and speaking of the script! the one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. but there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. beautiful soundtrack. there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for, and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. if you're going to buy the film, i recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for "if only", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.i do not work for the people who made holes, by the way, i'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves. if you haven't seen it, do it. now. this very instant. go!

typically, "kids" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. but then again, that's before holes hit the scene. sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. the acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways (which holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). the only down side? the hokey looking lizards. overall, however, an 8/10.

holes is not your average disney stuff- it's very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy, focus-group designed "family entertainment" that uncle walt's studio passes off as live-action. perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. but as the story progresses, stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. jon voight is especially nasty and colorful, and sigourney weaver is beautiful, as always.

holes is a fable about the past and the way it affects the present lives of at least three people. one of them i will name, the other two are mysteries and will remain so. holes is a story about stanley yelnats iv. he is unlucky in life. unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the yelnats men and has been since exploits of stanley iv's `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn. it is during just such a turn that we meet stanley iv. he has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player. he is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp. `i've never been to camp before,' says stanley. with that the judge enthusiastically sends him off to camp green lake.camp green lake is an odd place, with an odd philosophy, `if you take a bad boy, make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.' we learn this little pearl of wisdom from mr. sir (john voight) one of the camp's `counselors.' we get the impression right away that he is a dangerous man. he at least wears his attitude honestly; he doesn't think he is nice. the camp's guidance councilor, mr. pendanski (tim blake nelson) is a different matter entirely. he acts the part of the caring sensitive counselor, but he quick, quicker than anyone else in authority to unleash the most cruel verbal barbs at his charges. the warden has a decided capacity for meanness, but other than that she is a mystery. these three rule camp green lake, a place that has no lake. it is just a dry dusty desert filled with holes, five feet deep and five feet wide. its local fauna, seem only to be the vultures, and dangerous poisonous yellow-spotted lizards. green lake seems is, in many ways, a haunted place.holes works in spite of the strange setting, and the strange story, because it understands people. specifically because it is honest in the way it deals with the inmates of camp green lake. the movie captures the way boys interact with one another perfectly. it captures the way boys can bully each other, they way they can win admiration, the way they fight with one another, and the way boys ally themselves along the age line. it is this well nuanced core that makes everything else in the film believable. what is also refreshing about this film the good nature of its main character. he does not believe in a family curse, he is not bitter about the infamous exploits of his `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.' in fact he loves hearing the story. stanley iv is not bitter about the past, and determined not let it affect him in the way it has affected his father and grandfather. there is at times a lot of sadness in the film, but not a lot wallowing angsty silliness. and that is refreshing.holes is an intelligent, insightful and witty family movie. it entertains, and not in any cheap way. it is not a comedy, though it has its laughs. it dares to be compelling, where many family movies tend to play it safe and conventional. as such it transcends the family movie genera and simply becomes a good film that everyone can enjoy. i give it a 10.

eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in egypt. really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century. i also didn't realize the series flopped. there is a second season airing now isn't there? it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all. it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time. the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place, but that is to be expected from any show. the remainder of the first season is excellent. i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states.

i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well. it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant. i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time. i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right. a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next!! i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show! we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it.

this is a perfect series for family viewing. we gather around the tv to watch this on bbc america. it is an up-to-date version of robin hood and it appeals to children and adults alike. our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching robin's next exploits. we can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free "on demand" viewing.the wardrobe has a spot of current fashion. there is a moral to each story. it is entertaining. the violence is not over-the-top or needless. the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william's feel to it. it is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair.there is so much garbage on television from brain rotting "reality" tv to senseless violence. you should take this for what it is and that is an updated "robin hood" not to be compared with the movie exploits of errol flynn. this is a gem to be enjoyed by all. parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. he is a robin hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight. maid marian is also an appealing role model for young girls. rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "night watchman." the sheriff of nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between billy joel and tim curry. guy gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad "guy". the only question we have is "where is friar tuck?"

i absolutely love this show, but i saw the second episode first. after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first. the first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. however, i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters. as a first episode, it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good. the episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.

this movie is based on the art of frank frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the death dealer being the best example). surprisingly, the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. however, since the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans), this works pretty well.but what i really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences, a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe. this movie has the feeling of the best conan comics, not surprisingly since roy thomas is the writer of the marvel series of our favourite cimmerian! this is a far cry from the crappy live action conan, not to speak of all the b-movie of the genre.definitely recommended!

in a time of magic, barbarians and demons abound a diabolical tyrant named nekhron and his mother queen juliane who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by the king jerol but when his beautiful daughter princess teegra has been kidnapped by nekhron's goons, a warrior named larn must protect her and must defeat nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named darkwolf.a nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them ( rotoscoping), it's ralph bakshi's second best movie only with "american pop" being number one and "heavy traffic" being third and "wizards" being fourth. it's certainly better than his "cool world" or "lord of the rings", the artwork is designed by famed artist frank farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there's also a hottie for the guys.i highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2-disc limited edition dvd from blue underground.also recommended: "the black cauldron", "the dark crystal", "conan the barbarian", "the wizard of oz", " rock & rule", "wizards", "heavy metal", "starchaser: legend of orin", "fantastic planet", " princess mononoke", " nausicca: valley of the wind", " conan the destroyer", " willow", " the princess bride", "lord of the rings ( 1978)", " the sword in the stone", " excalibur", " army of darkness", " krull", "dragonheart", " king arthur", " the hobbit", " return of the king ( 1980)", "conquest", " american pop", " jason and the argonauts", " clash of the titans", " the last unicorn", " the secret of nimh", "the flight of dragons", " hercules (disney)", " legend", " the chronicles of narnia", " harry potter and the goblet of fire".

i had watched snippets from this as a kid but, while i purchased blue underground's set immediately due to its being a limited edition, only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and that's mainly because bakshi's american pop (1981) just turned up on late-night italian tv (see my review of that film below)! anyway, i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops (the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were, admittedly, less so) with a rousing if derivative score. the plot, again, wasn't exactly original, but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf; the hero and heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed (her bra could be torn off any second) and half-naked to boot (her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass)! still, it's clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front (that involving darkwolf being particularly savage); the final showdown though brief, is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains' lair inside a cave .in the long run, apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops, the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian (1982) and the beastmaster (1982) but also animated tv series such as blackstar (1981-82) and he-man and the masters of the universe (1983-85).as for the accompanying the making of "fire and ice" (tv) (mark bakshi, 1982) **1/2:vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action 'performances' (in a studio) of segments from the script - which would then be traced, blended in with the backgrounds and filmed. still, having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation (on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets, for instance), it's doesn't make for a very compelling piece...

thsi is one great movie. probably the best movie i have ever seen. i watch it over and over again. i must give it 10/10 stars because like i said this is probably the best movie i have ever seen. this movie +popcorn+coke= best mix you can imagine. if you want to watch some movie then i clearly recommend this one. first i sawed it i liked it so i buy-ed it and now i own it and watch it probably every day. my sons like it and think that this is the best movie ever seen. this movie is about guy in fantasy world. i don't want to spoil all the movie so you can enjoy it after you read my text. lovely movie lovely characters, lovely story, and just great stuff. a must watch movie. hope you enjoyed my comment cyajim make

watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year. it wasn't at all a bad movie, certainly not average, but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional (which, perhaps as based on frank miller's comic book, was the right decision to go with). but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat, with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings. while i would probably re-watch fire and ice before 300 again, they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being, naturally, that it's frank frazetta, the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics, collaborating with director ralph bakshi, in what isn't typical hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans.what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time (it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day) is the possible cons mentioned before and, maybe, that you will see something somewhat unique. fire and ice isn't even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature, but it's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made, and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre-historic, part out-of-this-world fantastic, and part medieval, and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds, the skies and grounds. there's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design; bakshi went as far as to say it's more frazetta than him. this may be true, but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion (my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me).i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it. if you're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada, so suffice to say it's about, well, fire against ice, with characters named nekron and darkwolf (the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance) and teegra (the typical hottie who's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure). what the plot does do, as an asset, is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action, the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle, like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes. and per usual for bakshi, he conjures up some craziness (if not quite his usual inspired lunacy) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material. if you've seen wizards, you'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent.so, if you're an animation buff, seek this out right away for some 'old-school' (i.e. 1980s) action and incredible design. for everyone else, it's... good, not great, as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension, with some alterations, 300.

with ralph bakshi most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords. you'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy. the lord of the rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department.fire and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view. the rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. you still get some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over-all the look has definitely gotten better since bakshi's last fantasy epic. the animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style to it, and unlike in lotr where this style was often at odds with the actual content, here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere.unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurred. lorn and tigra are easy cases but even the main villain necron was difficult to follow not to mention that guy with furry face mask (also known as just 'that guy'). even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate, there are some odd quirks in the audio-department and tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming.however, i believe the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot-line. the scant clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously. it's still a hella cool and really funny.

this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi; after watching it on youtube that is. set in the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. nekron, lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana, has set their sights on conquest of the known world. when their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named larn, he (larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord. meanwhile, the sub-human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeep's king jarol's sultry daughter princess teegra; but she manages to escape, and eventually meets with larn, who promises to escort her back to firekeep; if the sub-humans don't find them first.this movie did very little box office (as did most of ralph bakshi's films), but has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of the art, a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta. also, i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas, the two men who had done conan comic book stories, and the background painters included james gurney, the illustrator of the dinotopia novels; though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia. and also the painter thomas kinkade, noted for his artwork for figurines, music-boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings. and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former.so overall, i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made, and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta. with plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure.

good story and excellent animation. the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious, and that's a good thing. anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it. the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral. most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. anyone familiar with frazetta's, bakshi's, or even tolkien's work know they are not racist. anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie. it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo. the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate. i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon. i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition.

fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named nekron. the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier. the ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill nekron. fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators. he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself, like the great film heavy traffic. i didn't like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi's other work, but i still found the film to be enjoyable. it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough. the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it. i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time. still it's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older. i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did.

ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of "the lord of the rings" i wondered: what the hell is 'rotoscope' animation?!!! well... i finally found out... i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is... and i liked it... a lot... very good story line... it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon... see it if you get bored with contemporary animation.... don't get me wrong... i'm not saying it's just a nice cartoon... it's a pretty good movie too...

this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? it's quite effective.fire and ice, in it's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it's esthetic quality. i for sure did not mind! bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in cool world, and i don't think he has to apoligize since it's pretty much animation for adults. but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it.this one was just special, so different from the standard disney or anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly bakshi's finest. for those who like animations with lushious women: try space adventure cobra as well.i give fire and ice 8 out of 10.

i enjoy ralph bakshi films ("wizards", "cool world" and the underrated animated "lord of the rings") and am a frank frazetta collector and fan. i am also a sword and sorcery fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice burroughs and robert e. howard.i missed "fire and ice's" theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then. therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me. however, i bought it with some trepidation, because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a "collectible" gathering dust until the day i died. fortunately my fears were groundless and i was pleasantly impressed with this movie.as with frazetta art this is a gritty film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy/sword and sorcery films without being cheesy or dirty. the art is good and you see glimpses of frazetta at his best. even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again. however, my wife has some objections due to the scantily clad princess (very frazetta-esquire). i don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene.there is roto-scoping used, but personally i enjoy roto-scoping. it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation.despite some continuity problems, i recommend this film to all bakshi, frazetta, conan, and sword and sorcery fans. enjoy!

i won't claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi, because i am not. i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far: coonskin, wizards, fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally "fire and ice". what i can claim, is that i found "fire and ice" to be the most enjoyable of the lot. it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie.deserving first mention, is the animation itself. i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here. i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were. the style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made "fire and ice" feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon. sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent, especially near the end of the movie. some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters.with realistic moving characters, realistic action would naturally follow. not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder's 300. i did notice however that though there was blood shed, the blood splatters were kept to a minimum. again, a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too "over the top".though i do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys.did i say bad guys?? yes i did. because that is exactly what the story is about, a standard good vs evil tale. nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clichés that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens. anyone looking for "depth" would be sorely disappointed. the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best(i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf's obsession with killing nekron and his mother. scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show). in fact, i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a "tech demo" of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art, with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper "movie".a true classic of a bygone era, "fire and ice" really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters. it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense. would it hold up to animated film standards of today? definitely not. but i urge animation fans in general to "get off your high horse" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you. it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out.

why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime. "conan" is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better. the brutal violence, cool character designs, and good pacing, make this one of the best fantasies around. it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen. this is not similar to bakshi's usual frenetic style. it's quite a departure for bakshi, and in my opinion his best work. i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves.

in my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier. i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies, but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70.the artists and animated did a great job. in my opinion, this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design. animation are extremely smooth and realistic. for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see, so everyone did a great job. it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, that beets typical anime girls with ease.unfortunately, there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment. first, the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and is really old-fashioned by modern standards. second, due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs. finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment.conclusion: a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian, but not to a novel.

picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks, sure did get my moneys worth!. could care-less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady diet of simpsons (sorry mr. groening). the best part, facial expressions. recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes, good friends and a couple of cold ones!

when i saw this animation for first time (i was 15 maybe) i was really impressed! it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more. tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark...the colors are not that ...colorous. the characters don't talk much, there are no long and boring conversations of this and that (like in ghost in the shell).with its dark pictures, views of strange beasts and sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian stories, full of violence and horrendous creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, dwelled by dragons, throlls, orks...and one mysterious hero to stop evil...

i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire & ice on an old oop rental videotape. well for one thing, this is better than any other conan-esque film you'll ever see. sure, it's cheesy, but who cares? it stood the test of time, and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr:fotr (though i love that film.) the plot goes like this: after a battle between fire & ice, a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols (ice) subhuman creatures, while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her. yeah it doesn't sound as a original as nurse betty, but that's not the point. it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies: fire & ice. and it succeeds. as for the action scenes: superb. they are well handled, have terrific suspence, and have plenty of loud noises. just check out the climatic battle, now that's an ending! the acting and dialogue: competent. really. they aren't gonna be nominated for an oscar, but they are ok and don't get on your nerves. the animation is quite good. shot on 3d and rotoscoped (i think), it looks pretty good. a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn, and although the character designs feel a little 1-dimentional, they are ok. overall, this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical "entertainment". 10/10

for a low budget project, the film was a success. the story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. eva longoria, who now stars on the tv show "dragnet," is sexier than ever. the locations were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes, but the music keeps this script moving. although this film has it's share of problems, such as continuity, i must say that i would rent the director's next movie. if your a film student, you could learn a few things from the director's commentary.

if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show "desperate house wives" then you are missing out. eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon. this was eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. she was 24 when she shot it, and looked hot then. as for this low budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has another soon to be released movie "juarez, mexico" currently playing at many film festivals across the united states. in fact, it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. what would be nice to see is a "snitch'2" with a higher budget.

ok where do i begin?... this movie changed my life! the plot was seamless. james cahill has out done himself. initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn't seen it on the silver screen. however this was before exploring the dvd's many features!!!! oh my god jakes cahill's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting. he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience.i was so impressed by the other actors. the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel.i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard! all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years! where my oscars at dawn!!!!!!!!!!!

one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote "do you believe in love at first site?".a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. gabby (aka joey) played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. lol.the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment.. which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm (cut throat mafia). this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming.personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. thats if i can find it anywhere, lol!

where would one start a review of the film snitch'd? james cahill, god rest his soul, made one of the most daring insights into the human psyche since encino man. his beautiful story unravels around a drug squad cop mcclure, which is a name synonymous with a character from the simpsons who also happens to be an actor! said cop delves deep into the underworld that is high school drug taking, and discovers a gang war to rival that of police academy 1, and i mean the one where jones is racially vilified by his new partner, but manages to come out with some of the funniest sounds you will ever hear.cahill's grasp of effects, both visual and aural is electrifying, the slight pause between action on screen and from the speakers adds to the drama that is snitch'd, a real gritty like underground thriller. also, kudos to his brilliant use of makeup, such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue! yuck! i feel the world of film is much less from james' passing, his memory will linger on and on and on, reborn with every passing mention of his flagship production, snitch'd. his insightful director's commentary released a coke-hit up the nose of any discerning film goer, truly appropriate with the harsh reality that is life on the streets, captured in all the beauty of a roughneck punk knocking over a rubbish bin in a brawl.but i ask you, why did the big bosses swimming pool look so cheap? i'll tell you why, because thats life in santa ana baby, its not all drive bys and hastily constructed principle's offices, oh no. there are some folk who must infiltrate the soft, tattooed underbelly of street life in la to kick their way through in moves that would not seem out of place at a school for special children's production of double dragon: the play.the only qualm i have with this film, is that there was never a sequel made. come on steven spielberg, come on george lucas, come on guy that made revenge of the nerds 1 through 23, how hard could it be to step it up a notch and pay tribute to this great man, james cahill.he discovered eva longoria you know. oh yeah, that he did.jonah

wow! this is a good movie! the acting wasn't good at all, but if you look at some moments in the film, rewind, and watch it again, it is genius! the man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. wow!i never expected that. then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. and the genius quotes: ''nice shades, i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just brilliant! and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. what a hit! and in the middle of the film, one guy in a car shot one time, then 3 guys fall, he is really good at aiming. it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. the end was brilliant, it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. jason peters falls down, and roll over again while he is dead! i can't say with more words how great this movie is!

this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever. ever. but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest. the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless. i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd's at my local pound shop. me and some friends then watched it, admittedly whilst rather drunk. it soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film. instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill's last film. at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered. instead we watched the film right through. at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream, something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours, whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons. we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed, this wasn't a work of abysmal film. this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at. this was a film that anyone can enjoy. this was genius.

this is the best of shelley duvall's high-quality "faerie tale theatre" series. the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief, and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood. jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella, especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick's prince charming. jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well, although i'm not sure i liked the "southern lady" characterization with some of the lines. steve martin's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin, but a tiny bit misplaced in the show's flow.as is customary with the series, there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children (ages 15 and up). with a couple of small bumps, the show flows well, and they live happily ever after. children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much.

here is one the entire family will enjoy... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. shelley duvall outdid herself with this unique, imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood. the scripts offer new twists on the age-old fables we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode. "cinderella" is no exception to duvall's standard and in my opinion it's one of the top five of the series, highlighted by jennifer beals (remember her from "flashdance"--and she's still in hollywood today making a movie here and there) in the title role, jean stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and eve arden as the embodiment of wicked stepmotherhood. edie mcclurg ("ferris bueller's day off") and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters. matthew broderick is an affable prince henry. you'll all keep coming back for this one!

i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best! it's funny, romantic, and a classic. i recommend this for all ages. it's great for little kids because it's well, cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top. i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now. it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time. the acting is great and it never gets old. if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this. i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all. (sorry disney) i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows. they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.

i have always been a huge james bond fanatic! i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day, and the world is not enough. the graphic's for everything or nothing are breathtaking! the voice talents......... wow! i love pierce brosnan! he is finally bond in a video game! he is bond! i enjoyed the past bond games: goldeneye, the world is not enough, agent under fire, and nightfire. this one is definitely the best! finally, mr. brosnan, (may i call him mr. brosnan as a sign of respect? yes i can!) he was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game....... at long last! duh! i've seen him perform with robin williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team. pierce brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( i mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: "pierce brosnan, thank you for being james bond," "if it wasn't for you, i wouldn't know who james bond is." he's a great actor! i am a huge fan of willem dafoe even though i've seen him in a couple of movies. his role as nikolai diavalo was brilliant. (did i spell the character's name right?) lol!!!! he does a great job with an accent. sometimes i can't even hear an accent. i have seen willem, i mean mr. dafoe, perform in two movies: finding nemo, and spider-man with my favorite actress: kirsten dunst! she rocks! anyway, he never ceases to amaze. and richard kiel, wow, he's definitely got the part of jaw's nailed. i've seen him in the movie's and he's awesome! as a matter of fact, my grandparent's have met mr. kiel, and i was jealous when they told me. but, kirsten dunst is at the top of my list of celebritie's that i want to meet. john cleese was breathtaking. i have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating q! mr. cleese was hilarious! i've seen him work with pierce brosnan in goldeneye and tommorow never dies. he's awesome! john cleese's most recent project is shrek 2 starring mike myer's, cameron diaz, julie andrew's and eddie murphy. ( shrek 2 is now in theatre's!) good luck 007! oh, yeah, and as q alway's says: "grow up 007!"

** warning - this post may contain spoilers **i only got a gamecube in september 2005, and the first two games i bought were james bond games, the decent agent under fire and the dull goldeneye rogue agent. the next game i planned to get was everything or nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games i already had. i have to say, he was right. i bought this for a tenner in hmv, and when i got home, i slammed it in to my cube and played it for hours on end. it was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline. graphics were some of the best i have seen (but now that the xbox 360 has come out, farcry instincts predator has some of the best graphics known to man). the storyline was clever; mad man (willem dafoe, named as nikolai diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (heidi klum, named as katya nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, james bond, have to destroy on a train. the bad thing is that one of them is hidden in katya's boobs. you then have to thwart their plans and save the world.the great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as cleese voicing q. there are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky.gameplay - 10/10 graphics - 9/10 sound - 9/10 replay value - 7/10 multiplayer - 8/10i give this game a grand total of 90%

goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history. their is no doubt about that. but this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day bond champ, of its time.this was not a bond game based on material from another medium. this was a completely new; scripted game. which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. which gives it that more cinematic feel. with a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done. with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. despite being quite old now, in video game years. it's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life. even now just thinking about it, i've got the theme song stuck in my head. such a great cast and well-written storyline.the story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. superbly done, in true bond fashion. which can only be named awesome, completely awesome.i've gotta go throw this game on now. if you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!

don't get me wrong. "goldeneye" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter "everything or nothing", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for "from russia with love", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la "goldeneye", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.as movie adaptations, "goldeneye" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from "a view to a kill". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from "the spy who loved me" and "moonraker" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into "bond reflex" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular "bond moments", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. "goldeneye" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.

this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because: the missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good. the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do. this james bond game has a good story to it. the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool. also the graphics in this game pretty good.overall score ********* out of **********

this game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. when i got agent under fire, i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of james bond game. this time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond, william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo, and judi dench as m (forgive me all if i spell it wrong). this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around.i give this a 10/10

i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history... the antebellum years and the civil war in particular. i purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection. though not of the caliber of civil war films such as "glory" or "gettysburg," provides a lot of history on the pre-civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point.maybe it's the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war. i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learning how to make war, then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!actually, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in may, the other in june. the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention henry a. dupont, first graduate of the may class; and george custer, last grad of the june class. the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (i think the first class had attended five years, the other for four). as the movie portrays, cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other... george "fanny" or "autie" custer; alonzo "lon" cushing; james "beauty" stuart (for j.e.b. stuart, class of 1854), etc.i say this film is "santa fe trail" as it should have been because that 1940 film, while enjoyable, really fudges history. cadets from several different classes are all graduating together. jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping john brown's 1859 insurrection at harper's ferry. in fact, stuart and custer were never friends, but enemies during the war. they faced each other (for the first time, i think) at gettysburg in 1863 (stuart was at the harper's ferry raid, but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place)."fanny" custer plays a role in "class of '61," though his classmate chums, dev o'neill and shelby peyton are fictional. i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o'rorke and john pelham, two people you can look up.anyway, i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th century america.

two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though.some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess. they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as "attractive" as she was in the original.though costumes like batman, batgirl, killer croc and scarecrow look badass, especially scarecrow.the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin, tim drake. while nightwing(dick grayson) comes to the rescue often. batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass.the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "over the edge" might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out.overall 8-9/10

this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman, mark hamil as the joker, etc. the villains are really good such as the joker, two-face, catwoman, clayface, etc. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good. so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good.overall score: ********* out of ********** **** out of *****

i liked it... just that... i liked it, not like the animated series... i love it!!!. the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate, but this cartoon was awesome, but it really didn't like it that much. there's too much people talking about bruce being so cold, but if this is around 5 years later, anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude, so to me it isn't a flaw. batgirl was awesome she really fit there, as there isn't more dick grayson as a robin, batman needed a good teammate, not like the new robin, he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child. but heres what didn't work: the new artwork... it isn't horrible but... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman. this is a dark character, with a maniac killer like the joker, so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon, the joker isn't a bad design but i still like the past joker (but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond:return of the joker) , so this joker isn't near as good. the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice. my favorite character: harley quinn (im in love for her) they put an awesome episode for her: mad love (to me the best episode of this series). here we finally know how she turned harley quinn, and how the joker twisted her mind, and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series, darker, no happy ending, brutal fight with the joker (but too short), this is how it was to be all the series. but in general i didn't like how she made harley in this series... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way, she get punched, she say nonsenses, she make flaws... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her, not from her... and here they put ridiculous (like i said the only episode where i don't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper) so in general its a good series, it has it upsides and downs, the drawn could be better ( my good!!! kill that catwoman!!!!) nice sound effects, nice music, nice voices and nice episodes: my favorites, mad love, jokers millions, old wounds, sins of the father, and cold comfort. if you enjoyed batman:tas you can watch this but don't spec too much, in the other hand if you didn't watched tas, watch this first and then watch tas in that way you're really gonna love tas :d

the new batman adventures (also called gotham knights) takes place 5 years after the final episodes of batman: the animated series (b:tas) and only aired for 24 episodes. this isn't a horrible show, but it just isn't as good as the original batman animated series. i'll start with all the things that i found not to be very good.first thing's first, the animation itself: long and sweet, gotham isn't dark anymore, the sky is always bright red and orange, b:tas did this also, but it was drawn on a dark palate, do the colour of the sky was more ominous, in this show, the colour of the sky is too bright. it all just looks like any other kids show and doesn't seem unique like batman: tas did with it's dark, cool art style on gotham. the art style is ok, but doesn't remind me of batman anymore. every character is comprised of straight lines, squares, and triangles making characters look less human-like. in the original series (b:tas), characters look more like drawn versions of real people. the animation may be more consistent here than in b:tas, but it definitely isn't as good. next: some of the episodes seem too dumbed down and childish, but some of the subject matter is even stronger than in b:tas.(two-face attempting to kill tim drake/robin 2, and some villains get some pretty harsh treatment). this leads me to my next point.because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the final episodes of the batman animated universe, many villains do meet their demise or leave forever. poison ivy apparently drowns when a cruise ship explodes; two-face nearly kills penguin, killer croc, and himself, so he's moved to arkham forever; joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (though he will return later on the justice league animated series); catwoman moves away to france leaving batman, etc... just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great characters! the villains' motives are pretty bad, too. there are none! in b:tas, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and their lives are ruined, that's why they act the way they do, in this show, the villains are just committing crimes to progress the story. it's like batman just doesn't even care about saving whatever sanity there is left in the people that he fights, he just beats them senseless. this batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but since he's been doing this job for years, i can see why he is so harsh. next, the redesigned character models: they're awful. gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds... is he sick? many villains look stupid (joker, riddler, catwoman, mr. freeze, mad hatter, and killer croc are among the worst). although, i do think that some characters look better (bane, scarecrow, batgirl). harley is about the same, and ivy (who is even hotter now) has pale green skin.with the series having many faults, some episodes are great- over the edge, mad love, beware the creeper, girls night out, old wounds, legends of the dark knight, and never fear are my favourite ones here, in my opinion. all of the crossovers featuring batman in the superman animated series were great, also.the absolute worst part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original. on the dvd features of the original batman animated series, they talk about how proud they were with the art style, and how difficult some characters were to animate, but they did eventually succeed with (the difficult animation necessary to animate clayface, for example). on the dvd features of the new batman adventures, the creators basically say "to hell with b:tas, this is a fresh, new re-vamp, it looks better and we love how we nearly ruined the series!" (alright, that is an exaggeration). when the creators cast away the amazing art style of b:tas, that really annoyed me!it's not a bad show, but i still don't like it as much as the original animated series. at least the show doesn't talk down to its audience, so for that reason, i still commend it. though some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching. superman: the animated series, and justice league: the animated series are great follow-up shows to batman: the animated series and the new batman adventures, so give them a watch as well.

i loved this series when it was on kids wb, i didn't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own. it was an interesting perspective to their relationship. i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series, and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. the only thing that i didn't like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. i just wish some of the episodes could be longer. my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series, and it's called "over the edge", in my opinion as good if not better then "heart of ice" and "robin's reckoning." overall a nice follow up, along with superman this show made my childhood very happy.

lost isn't the greatest tv show in history, but it's not far off. it doesn't have the plot or characterisation of the west wing or possibly even early er, however, it is arguably the most continuously gripping show i have every come across. i love the way i can't guess what's going to happen. i love the re-telling of the characters' back stories which often give rise to new dimensions for us to see them in. in some ways i want the show to last forever, but i think they can get 6-7 seasons out of it before they have to end it on a glorious high. the combination of the characters and their nationalities coupled with the show's fluidity for moving backwards and forwards thus extending dead characters "life spans" all adds to the overwhelming sense that this show is something very different from what we are used to. it's captivating, surprising and (here's a little suggestion for all of you conspiracy theorists) more than a little interactive- keep those internet discussions going- you're only adding to the plot...

the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters! explaining just enough to stay excited! of course this show has some flaws! in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season! many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there! like rose and her husband! where the hell are they? what happened to them? maybe they will return in later episodes! but it is a little inconsistent! that being said "lost" manages to be thrilling every episode(especially the first two seasons)! that is a very hard thing to do! i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show! this is not a bad thing! it even saves some episodes from getting boring! one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! you will grow to love these characters! good or bad! but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure! the danger of "lost" getting canceled due to declining ratings is near! and that would be devastating!

lost holds something interesting for everyone. you can say an awfully lot about this series, and an awfully lot has been said, so i won't be the one to spell it all out for you again. just read the persons who loved it, and you'll know why you want to watch it. the nice thing about this series is that its totally new. there are not much movies -and even fewer- series based on the theme of only suspense, but lost lives up to the theme with pride. its all about the unexplained and if you combine that with an exotic location, nice plot twists, an excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in single episodes) you'll have a series in which every episode is a story on its own but part of a greater telling. you want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you'll want to know where the writers are taking you. the result of that is that its a series which does not let you go. on a more sceptic note, the series went under a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. it is well known that lost was only written for one season originally and when the overwhelming success followed, the writers were overwhelmed too. in my opinion they made the mistake to add even more mysteries and in a higher pace in season 2, then to solve the ones (or partially at least) the ones of season 1. at the end of season 2 you ended with a big blurr of secrets, plot twists and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much a viewer can take. the difference between season 2 and 3 however was huge. season 3 handed out a lot of insights, to partially replace them with new questions. and that's exactly how they should write; you want to thumble from one plot twist to the next, not get a tsunami of secrets spread all over you and then pick up a few to explain to the viewers. they got that in season 3 and brings us a promising series future for season 4. its good to see that such a different format of a series, can be so hugely popular.

"lost", "24", "carnivale", "desperate housewifes"...the list goes on and on. these, and a bunch of other high-quality, shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history. "lost" is pure genius. incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a tv-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. anyone who isn't hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. it may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this. hope they keep it up (as i'm sure they do).

before lost everything shown on tv was predictable . you could predict who was gonna die or who will find something, but in lost you could predict nothing. every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. i literally became addicted to it. lost is a classic work of art. it gives you something to look forward to every week. it is genius. the surrounding is brilliant it is calm and warm at the beach and so scary in the jungle. the characters are a work of genius every one of them especially the ones already on the island. the castaways are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other castaways that die with them.

after becoming completely addicted to six feet under, i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. well, i was wrong! lost is spellbinding!! i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off. the richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. i am totally and completely hooked. i don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply. i feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix. when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house. this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen!!!

lost is one of a kind...its so enchanting and full of suspense, thrill and emotions all at the same time.i have never seen any tv series like this before. it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay. the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching it.it is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent form.the series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted island.i am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show lovers.watch it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere.

the 1st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (and seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. i mean, i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. from then on, i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season, only a little better. i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative. the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. i loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing.season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless, great. i loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. ("tricia tanak is dead" is one of my favorite episodes). this season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! now, the 4th season. i had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're good, but then it really started to get boring and monotonous. i mean, i really despise the new "rescuers" such as miles and daniel. the plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and most of all .... season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series: the mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (charlie gone) and overall excitement. also, some of my favorite characters have left.

lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done ... and so is ... if you lovers of mysteries, intrigue and adventure this is the series for you ...in the first season ... since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season ... in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides ... the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season ... the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries ... but not as the second season but at a somewhat different ... for the fifth season expects ...

series 1as the uk eagerly awaits the launch of series two of 'lost', series one (which just finished showing here) did not disappoint.a group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash-landed into a deserted island. they pray for rescue. however, as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them, they begin to wonder whether they are alone.admittedly, the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes, which hurls at the group a polar bear, a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island. nevertheless, the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode. possibly the greatest thing about 'lost' is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks. this gives us more insight and, hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present.ultimately, this show is a superb combination of drama, suspense and the supernatural; it is, quite simply, unmissable.spoilers for season 1 followseries 2after the cliffhanger that was the end of series 1 of 'lost', series 2 begins with our protagonists delving deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the hatch. they discover a mysterious man who has a job to do. meanwhile, michael and sawyer struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft.as the series progresses, the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set, as every episode of the series contains more twists than a curly-wurly chocolate bar, one of which introduces a whole host of new characters. with every mystery solved with 'lost', five brand new ones seem to come out of the woodworks. after the 974th plot twist of the series, it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane-crash survivors make it off the island. however, the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions, despite its anti-climatic ending.

lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait. suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about. so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.

the first series of lost kicked off with a bang... literally and slowly decreased in pace. this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused. i would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and don't get pt off by the slower episodes. the acting throughout is excellent but why have 5 series' planned... why??? all this means is that there will be no answers for at least 4 years, oh well, i'll keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing.

it's not well shot, well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show i've seen since twin peaks. every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure. they have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they've just told you everything you wanted to know. however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal. some characters are very two dimensional. the more experienced actors like locke and ecko really stand out over actors who play jack, kate, sayid and so on. the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to. annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing. however, the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously. all in all its a great show but not perfect.

i watched the first series avidly, but wondered whether i'd go back again after a lengthy break from it. however, i tuned into episode one of series 2 and was hooked all over again. this really is excellent telly; ground-breaking stuff like mission:impossible back in the 1960s. the characters are well rounded, and expand as the series goes on, they change as they adapt - some more readily than others - to their new surroundings, but they cleverly remain strictly in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry for, when something really crushing happens to them. i hope there will be many years of 'lost' to look forward to - and i don't actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries!

an absolutely brilliant show. the second season began where the first ended, with much mystery. suspense in most, if not all episodes and mystery everywhere. one that made me think and think again. it's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful. never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season. hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time, more mystery to be solved. good selection of cast too for this show, fit the characters perfectly. really can't wait to finally discover the secret. hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending.

only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! a wide variety of people stuck on a island. nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great ? it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files, a dose of "what" ?? and a big "hey" and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost to. the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... i think ...)with good and bad sides. but weird oh so weird ...

"i have looked into the eye of this island, and what i saw was beautiful," proclaims one of the main characters in abc's award winning television show "lost". the series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island, but that would be doing the show a disservice. "lost" follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island, each other, and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other. the situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island, either - and that they may not be alone.my initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period, but this proved to be unfounded. the narrative flows naturally, the dialogue is witty, the characters are memorable and the execution is superb. the island is a character all on its own, and to understand this comment you'd have to see the series for yourself, which only goes to show its originality and greatness.at the time of writing this review, only the first two seasons have aired, and they're filled with strong episodes. my only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway, but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes.if i can recommend one television series you should be following right now, it would certainly be this one. if you like excitement, adventure, character driven stories, an extremely strong cast and crew, beautiful locations, and an island that seems more spiritual than natural, "lost" is for you. just be sure you start at the beginning.

ok i'll be honest, when i first saw the trailer for the programme, i thought it was an advert for some sun-screen product. with all the people walking around on the beach. despite this i decided to watch it, thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at. but i was seriously amazed.from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked, why is he lying in the trees, why did the plane crash etc etc.it's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence, humour, action and suspense. but 'lost' manages all of this. with a great cast and crew, beautiful locations, and pretty decent special effects, 'lost' will catch anyone who tunes in, and is a must see for anyone who's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv.lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 (uk) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 =o

/the first episode i saw of lost made me think, i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster. but it's not like that, it's far more than that,because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost , well it's getting better every time. a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed. that's the real secret.this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters,this series deserves a 9 out of 10

i am obsessed! the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but i love it. i am on season 2, disc 5, and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now. for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. and, michael is on my list now. kidding... i am so happy to see there is a season 3, because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. i can't wait to see the rest now. thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of lost...i enjoy watching tv again. before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment!

this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television. i mean the acting is great, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: a plane crashed on an island. the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot!!!!!! matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is, josh holloway is so great, jorge garcia is hilarious, i could go on and on. also, the unexpected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. j.j. abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is. i mean this is better than alias, and i loved alias. whoever isn't watching this show, should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it, because they are missing something great. this show could possibly be the best show in television history!!

here is an innovative television drama; which so easily blends a compelling story, brilliantly drawn out character development, humour, romance, and drama into each episode. here is a show that sings to it's own tune, whether it's audience chooses to follow or not. how many other shows on television these days so boldly change in tone from one season to the next? where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works, that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like glue to that formula (prison break, 24, and desperate housewives come to mind) - lost takes a different route where even after achieving that plateau and that winning formula, the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely reinvent the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling. this is where lost differentiates itself from normal television. this is how it's so defiant of conventional tv. and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television. forget the naysayers - lost is, has been, and always will be, there to appease it's cult following first and the general public next. but it's a testament to it's inventiveness that it's garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences.

a very addictive series.i had not seen an exact combination among drama, action, suspense and sci-fi never before. i am impressed every chapter. the screenplay is very intelligent, i don't know how the creators invent all this amazing stories, every character have a strange past, troubles, stormy relationships, it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters.the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them: the numbers, they have met before without knowing it, and so on. the others, enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don't let us lose a chapter.mr. jj abrams, what did you think to create this amazing story?

hi:i heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so i tuned it out. after a few years i stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. wow was i surprised. can you say gravity well, damn i got sucked in. the pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. my favorite characters are ben, locke, jacob, richard alpert, sayid jarrah, sawyer, hurley, daniel faraday, jin & wife, walt, charlie, desmond, and jack's dad. jack and michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. kate 1 step above them, juliet was way more classy than kate. mr. eko way under-rated and on the level of charlie if not more, too bad they both died. the guy dressed in black talking to jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. as a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.regards

intriguing. exciting. dramatic. explosive. complex. epic. words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the grand story that is lost being told.from the acting down to the rare visual effects, lost is the essential show on television for fans of science-fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, and lots and lots of mystery.each cast member is so well chosen, and so good in their roles, that you either love them, or hate them, or downright wish them dead.the visual effects, when used (which is rare) are actually quite well done considering the usual production of shows. be it the "smoke monster", to the polar bears, lost is believable in terms of eye-candy.as far as story goes, nothing can compare to the vast complexity this show has made viewers like me endure. beginning to end, continuity is virtually perfect, characters are developed, and the ever-evolving story slowly gives the answers to its questions so many crave.overall, there is practically no flaw in lost. it does for dramatic/sci-fi television what arrested development did for comedy: it has set the bar.i highly recommend lost to those that are patient, intellectual, and love every moment of the ride, no matter how long it takes to reach the end.see this show.

lost is the best tv series there is.first of all,it has great actors and wonderful directing.the writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season 3 the writing became highly complex.for instance,who is jacob?why are there polar bears on the island?what's the fog?how did the island disappear?who is richard alpert?a lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't explain.i believe these people are wrong.i have confidence in the writers.i think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be gone.anyway,lost is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time.

lost, probably the best t.v series ever made. the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode, 100 more are raised. if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever. the survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own. after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting? and heres your answer, every season so far has always been full of surprises, your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time, very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully so far! the series just sucks you in, it's chilling and very addictive, everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story. lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v at it's best.how ever you want to put it. lost beat's all other show's by a landslide. and if your hating or criticising lost you don't know how to watch t.v or watch drama. lost simply doesn't disappoint, you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better. but it does! it just keep's on flowing it's unlike anything you would ever think off. "every thing happens for a reason." and that is truly shown in the series. eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that's happened or being done adds up. you will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on. the 10 minutes of excitement: you see something you didn't see coming, something major has happened to character or on the island. there's hope somewhere. you see a major twist that can or will change everything. you hear your thought's churn, you wonder what's gonna happen next. your heart beating. the 30 minutes of brilliance: you see a flawless scenes, tension building, you hear wonderful music by michael giacchino. you see great flash backs, impressive acting. you see wittiness, chilling atmosphere, which then get's converted back into tension.everyone has there show that they are addicted too, that they can't get enough of, that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode, that they talk about 24/7. too me and many others it's this series. lost. once you start watching, you won't get enough. the creators did a flawless job. lost is completely unique and original, you won't see anything like it. the clever idea of "flashbacks and flashforwards" and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts. would they ever make a series like "lost"? something so interesting and something you will always remember. it simply has stunned the world when it hit t.v. a new generation of dramatic/sci-fi. a instant classic before it reached out to the viewers.i'm sure you all heard of lost and it's 5 star reviews, and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it, so what's stopping you from watching?every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better, you get more interested as it goes along, you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off. the characters start to become very likable, and if your the critic type you would love to see lost in further detail, things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the island. all together it's a great drama and a flawless series. i guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far.....so if you don't watch lost, read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind. seeing is believing, so until you start watching you will never know .i strongly recommend this masterpiece of series: lost!! start watching!!! you have not seen nothing until you watch lost!!!

i love this show! it's like watching a mini movie each week!!! the first episode was so gripping and terrifying...so was part 2 of the pilot... i'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show! this is the real survivor! i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf... sorry if it's not another reality show, kiddies! there was once a time where there were...now brace yourself! actual tv shows! and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-teenth carbon copy of a law & order or nypd blue or csi series they're dishing out... watch this yourself to form your own opinion, don't take one from the boneheads here!

while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching "lost", i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since. the show, that is. not the polar bear. so bear (heh) with me while i throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as i can muster."lost" takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them, who are they? where did they come from? it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they're running away from something (sawyer and kate among others) or getting in touch with spirituality (locke, claire). but "lost" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses... and they all seem to be strangely connected.while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of "lost" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humour in their performances. there's also a multitude of eyecandy, but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows. the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch. their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive)  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action. the realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot. about this plot... imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for every character)  well, lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines. if you're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own storyline. if you're a dog you will have your own storyline. unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end, they are setting themselves up. i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out to this show, as i'm sure most people are.but assuming the writers do pull this off, "lost" is possibly the best show ever to hit television.9/10

forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films. its influence was felt for more than a decade. however, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help. but, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct krell civilization and "monsters from the id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie. what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible. the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration. i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic.

this was one of those $.50 cent deals of yore---and far more complex than most realize---and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, vs. crap like 'earth vs. the flying saucers'---the real 'killer' is the 'universality of plot'---everything hinges on two principles---the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking father's desire for his daughter, and the idea of what would happen should a world's tech reach the point where all citizen's desires become manifest.needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead, not many, if any left---and that became the fate of the 'forbidden' planet's populace---rather modern, actually. unfortunately the 'gear' of 'the krell'---wasted by ignorance, remains, and 'morpheus', the incestuous father, knows how to access such tech---and does so, to prevent losing his daughter to another. ancient plot, beautifully rendered.and considering its age, it remains a stunning suspense, action, human-emotion classic---and visually very modern---don't pass this one up---it presages all modern sci-fi---and its pscychological content elevates it, beyond any genre---a timeless work---and the soundtract! you will see/hear no pure 'synth' and perfectly syched moog background---a 'not miss'---

this has always been one of my favourite movies, and will always be. over the last few years i have become a 50's / 60's sci-fi freak, trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then. i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were. the great colours and the sets get me going too. it's a pity when they re-make some of these good old movies; they nearly always stuff it up, - just look at the recent re-do of the day the earth stood still, it's utter garbage!! forbidden planet is one of the benchmark space films of all time, and now they're trying to re-make it too, and i shudder to think what the new one will be like! to my mind, some things, such as fantastic classic movies, should just be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories, and giving people a thrill in the process. once they add all the techno-crap that we have available now, the film just seems to be more dog-meat from the hollywood sausage factory, - nothing special at all. by the way, i notice that the astronauts' uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for "queen of outer space"! that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, doesn't it? hey, less money and better films, hmmm....great performances in this movie from leslie nielsen, in a serious role, and anne francis, walter pidgeon (who has always been one of my favourite actors), earl holiman, and of course robby the robot!the special effects are fantastic, and the storyline is not too far-fetched. this is a great sci-fi experience!

forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema, especially from the 1950s. there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough. it's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it.on the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b-movies of the period. a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before. but the only one left is dr. morbis (walter pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead. morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the skipper (leslie nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth.but there's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily. meanwhile, there's some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira, and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldn't have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go. what happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas. while everyone may remember robbie the robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia.the acting from pidgeon is subtle: you wouldn't expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect. and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook (who, i should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides). and the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its "tones". but ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b-movie lot. when it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works. when it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors. and when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action.an inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic.

i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. all in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young' man

certain elements of this film are dated, of course. an all white male crew, for instance. and like most pre-star wars science fiction, it tends to take too long admiring itself.but, still, no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did, even down to the use of the "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots, and was the inspiration for all that followed, from c3po to data.the plot line, of course, is shakespeare's "the tempest". morbius is prospero, and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers... it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.

i've now seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it i like!50's us sci-fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch: they were either intelligently made and/or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese. forbidden planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, colour.it also had a head start with the script - although shakespeare might not have recognised it, it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well.it's the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on 200,000 years before. along the way the plot bristles with 50's stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you're watching it, but always do. that love triangle thing...yuk! disney's cartoonery still holds up well, and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after 50 years. robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though!all in all, with all faults, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives.

i should say at the outset there are many, many things i love about 'forbidden planet' and yes, i certainly consider it a 'classic' science-fiction film for many reasons. but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion. no less an authority than leonard maltin says 'forbidden planet' "...is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre." ambitious? without a doubt. intelligent? depends on what part of the film you're talking about. it certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point. at a cost of nearly $2 million (this was 1956, remember), mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling, eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before, even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects. 'charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies, yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here. even the dreaded 'monster from the id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people, unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8. when i see the various sets and take note of the art design, models, costumes, etc., i am reminded of nothing so much as 'the wizard of oz,' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects. so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless. 'forbidden planet' is wonderful to look at. the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated, matte paintings of planets and space in the background, and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth. it's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see. the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex, where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible. but then we get to the actors, darn it. the performances are almost uniformly awful, though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor, except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble. even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance, it's lugubrious at times. a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j.j. adams, and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film. he seems to instinctively know, thirty years ahead of time, that his true forte' lay in comedy, as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines. every forced reaction, whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation, looks right out of a high school play. anne francis, also very young, fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta, whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up. (alta morbius, now there's a name for you.) unfortunately, even at this early age, anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in 'butterfield 8.' there is a good story here, buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman's 'cookie,' ship's cook. (holliman turns in a horrendous performance too. i'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school.) based on shakespeare's 'the tempest,' the story of a dead race, the krell, and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'forbidden planet,' and for good reason. for a few minutes here and there, you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists' conception of the krell underground complex. is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings? you'll have to decide that on your own. oh, and of course there's robby the robot, every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like. he's funny. in places. so, 'forbidden planet' to me is a very, very mixed bag. it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed, not least of which was 'star trek.' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again.

as did others in this forum, when "fobidden planet" was offered in 1956, i rushed to see it. this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well. this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as "flash gordon". leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but walter pigeon, marvin miller, anne francis, richard anderson, earl holliman and especially warren stevens all acquitted themselves very well. there are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. the approach to altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, dr. morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants. veteran cyril hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director fred mcleod wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. it can be watched again and again with pleasure--i have been doing so for nearly fifty years. until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. still the best, many say. that says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem.

shakespeare's "the tempest" is a model for this exceptional science fiction film. we look for differences. prospero and his daughter, miranda, are stranded on a mediterranean island." morbius and altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star altair. ariel is a spirit. robby the robot is a man-made servant. caliban's evil hardly approaches that of monsters of the id. shakespeare spares prospero. morbius dies when altair 4 blows up. "the tempest" is a comedy. "forbidden planet" is a tragedy. we wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the krell in some future time. anne francis is altaira. jack kelly is lieutentant farman. kelly starred with james garner in the comedy/western tv series, "maverick."

i know i should like this film, and i do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying. it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well. i also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold. it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. on the plus side the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course robbie. if the robot was not in this film, i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is. the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the "krell." as many times as i've seen this movie, the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were. based on what was being produced at that time, besides "this island earth," forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time. being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.

when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show. yet, while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films, the 1950s did have some very good, if not great, science fiction films like the day the earth stood still, the incredible shrinking man, invasion of the body snatchers, war of the worlds, and the thing from another world. yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly mgm's first big foray into a level science fiction, forbidden planet, released in 1956. it was a 98 minute color film, directed by fred m. wilcox, that featured then state of the art special effects, and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume, from a screen treatment called fatal planet, by irving block and allen adler, who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the tempest into it.the film drew raves when it was released, for its oscar nominated special effects, its all electronic music score, by louis and bebe barron (although credited as electronic tonalities, to avoid music guild fees), vivid matte paintings- inspired by chesley bonestell, and the famed monster of the id (moti), which was animated by an animator, joshua meador, on loan from the walt disney studio. even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot, in his first role in either film or television. later he would appear in the film the invisible boy- included in this dvd as a bonus, as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone, night gallery, and lost in space- with whose own robot he is often confused, and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins.the tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story' aspect in the film. in the 23rd century, the united planets cruiser c-57d- a flying saucer, led by commander j.j. adams (leslie nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days), is en route to the planet altair iv, to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon, sent to the planet twenty years earlier. after a year's journey, there they encounter the lone survivor of the party, doctor edward morbius (walter pidgeon), the prospero stand-in- a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter altaira (anne francis)- the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt, and robby the robot, the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart. morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it. all in all, it's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings, and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy's and robby's exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity. yet, it's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures, for it's played straight, thus making it even funnier. as for the main feature? forbidden planet deserves all its kudos. it's not a perfect film, but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours, and far better than star wars, which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated, and juvenile. only such films like 2001: a space odyssey, solaris, alien and aliens, and the first two terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.it's worth knowing that, despite forbidden planet's 'happy ending', there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta, as well. after all, she is her father's daughter, and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time. also, the film wisely only 'shows' the moti once, and never shows the krel, for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects. the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do. forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories. watch it, and you will agree, as well as sleep a little less easy. but, even if you don't, there's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping. that alone is timeless.

okay, so robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. and don't get me started about the poster.this is still a great movie, 40 years after it was released. i grew up watching "science fiction" on the local tv station's "science fiction/adventure theater" on sunday afternoons, so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the '50s. at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.i doubt that many sf movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.

level one, horror.when i saw this film for the first time at 10, i knew it would give me nightmares. it did. surprisingly, as i recall, it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them.level two, psychoanalytic theory.later as an adult, i saw the story for what it was: what if the savage, unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest.level three, pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot's "what if" is through the science fiction genre. this is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that passes for the genre today.after 43 years, forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films. if planning a remake, skg or lucas, watch out!

today's sci-fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer-space with monster special effects (frequently ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). though tame by today's standards, the special effects of "forbidden planet" were quite striking for their time. even today, they still hold plausibility. yet, the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal. much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience. (what did the krell creatures look like?) by having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end, the tension and suspense held throughout the movie. the ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying. in my mind, this is still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi films ever made.

there were a lot of 50's sci-fi movies. they were big draws for the drive-in theaters. a lot of them were crappy even back then. this movie and 'the day the earth stood still' stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. from the very beginning with its eerie theremin musical score (which still sounds weird since theremins are hardly ever used) forbidden planet takes you where no man has gone before. speaking of star trek there's so much material in this film that got into star trek tos its like a pilot for the series; from the interactive captain/first mate/doctor, the mad scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; it is all de rigeur now but this was the first of its kind. besides, it has good acting and well-done artwork which even today evokes a certain awe at the imagery. consider how the huge krell machine is successfully depicted with some real depth. i saw this as a kid (at a drive-in :0)when it was a new movie and it scared me. of course every movie that was even vaguely scary did back then but i remember being real worried about the invisible monster. forbidden planet is a movie a sci-fi fan can watch several times and find something new with each viewing.

first off, consider that this film is nearly fifty years old! yet, it still stands up as one of the great films of all time. i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050?the story is simple, yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. i can still recall the first time i watched this, as a kid, when the monster enters the force-field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first (and only) time. had me shivering in fear, i can tell you. looks dated today, but still more than effective enough.the scenes with the tiger show their age now. you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira, but they are only just visible.likewise, the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done.it's also amazing to see leslie nielsen (better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies) as a young, but still mature man. he was 30 when this film came out! nearly 80 now!all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come. timeless.

there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.

i have loved this movie all of my life. it's such an intelligent story also, with plenty of classical allusions. eg. the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon. well, in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. in fp, walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his id monster. i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m on special effects, but about $1.50 on a screenplay.cheers

forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction, carefully staying within "hard" aspects of the genre (science -- not fantasy, ergo nerds will love it) while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values. morbius's isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens, a swimming pool, and the ultimate home appliance: robby the robot. "a housewife's dream!" exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robot's abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate waste.also revealing to the 1950s: fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation, although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept. there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer. perhaps most timely is the post-atomic fear that science is the enemy, and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge.yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci-fi genre. they aren't swashbucklers or heroes, but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a serviceman's crudeness and honesty. the good guys drive the flying saucer, and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like -- although their music er-"atmospheric tonalities" by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today. the views from morbius' house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais. the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers. there's a lot visually to like. although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies, forbidden planet is a cerebral movie, slow paced and talky. it is working on many levels at once: hard sci-fi against space adventure, philosophical against domestic. there are many suburban touches. in spite of all their space-talk, the soldiers are dressed for the golf course. morbius' fatal discovery is a humble educational facility, a schoolhouse. the most interesting character is morbius' daughter altaira. having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew. she's a post-madonna teen who designs her own space-age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits -- imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator. men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress, but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress. anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses. alas we'll never know if she was "working" him as he suspects, since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention. she is the character who makes the important change in the film. shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other "embeciles" in his landing party, she turns away from her father, her home, to leave with the sailors for earth. it's this act of defiance, of maturity, that sends morbius' id creature over the edge, allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell. maybe the krell had teenage daughters too...?

if you like star wars/trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. the intensity of the root material (shakespeare's "the tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later lucas). and just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. this was the first movie where you couldn't. miracle it was made at "a-movie" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was "lassie come home". until i looked him up, i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a "b" genre back then. this was either a very very visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood.there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively. there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; "computers", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. star trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later. and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off, fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. the "ship" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done, for tv or film. we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked.if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching fp will explain all that. it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'.

the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot. my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. how wrong i was. big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. i qualify with the word visually, because "war of the worlds" is a lot darker and scarier than "forbidden planet", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory.what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr. morbius' (walter pidgeon) home and laboratory. but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold. it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of "star wars". which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with sw, or in 1986 with "aliens". watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect, and i'm fairly resistant to hyperbole.it's not too much of a stretch to imagine "forbidden planet" as a direct antecedent of the 'star trek' tv series; gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'star trek'. i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c57-v headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series.where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the id'. that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures. the film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams (leslie nielsen) explained it.you know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. i think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby.

a flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.on the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. some compare it to shakespeare's tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its the tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek.anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. the special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. if it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.this is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi i like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. the clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek, lost in space, and even farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. while i do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it. some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles. unfortunately, nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). walter pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. ms francis, earl holliman, and the amazing robby the robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. the problems with the featured performances, i think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. though they certainly got most of the film quite right.

this is a film that has it all, the dashing hero, the beautiful damsel in distress, the noble figure with the tragic flaw, and a truly wonderful robot. forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesn't lose its flavor with repeated viewings (although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that score).movie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams, although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role. the distinguished and noble-looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret (id). other supporting cast deserve a nod, especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful "doc", and of course the charms of miss francis, as noted above.this film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. the credits call them "tonalities", but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the "theremin" device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track. still, it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krell.the special effects are also quite arresting. i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible "id" monster, and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe. the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways, guided by the enigmatic dr. morbius.i recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr. morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot. the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters. viewers of follow-on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes, although i recall he never had the "personality" of the original robby.i must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves, through force of will, to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes. although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by dr. morbius until pointed out by the clear-thinking commander adams, who forces dr. morbius to confront the evil within himself. it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr. morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine: "here. here is where your mind was artificially enlarged. consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine. but your subconscious had been made strong enough." zowee!forbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci-fi film ever, and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen.

a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogue etc.first, there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years more advanced than earth humans(us), and their technology, particularly the 8,000 cubic mile machine.second, there is the music and sound effects, which are inseparable from each other. it creates an eerie, unearthly feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music.third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned, it's also based on real science and doesn't break the laws of physics and biology.finally, and most importantly, forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and, more incredibly, succeeds in making an honest, intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human (or any other biological entity's) development, no matter how long we survive as a species.in other words, it predicts our inevitable destiny.

sure star wars (a movie i have seen at least fifty times) beats all the others in special effects, but this film has every thing else!it has horror(non-graphical), romance, robots, witty repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects, and drama.i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print, and i was amazed at how well it held up today. i thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne.ann francis in here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me.the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me.of course we all know that the "great bird of the galaxy" probably modeled much of "star trek" from this movie.no one has yet to beat robby, the robot, in terms of personality(sorry, r2d2 and c3po).this movie, overall, is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to!honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles.

i first saw this movie when it originally came out. i was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time.basic plot: an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.theme: an inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization, the krell-200,000 years removed. the "seed" of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another, unknowingly at first. the theme of this movie is very much good vs. evil.i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature-force. i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie.what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie "forbidden knowledge" and how relevant this will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently. advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand. we must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. this is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie.i learned in graduate school that "knowledge is power" is at best, in fact, not correct! knowledge is "potential" power depending upon how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [it's not what you know, but how you use what you know!]the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in mankind's own future. that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the krell in the movie-just winked-out.many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated!! i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40+ years ....rating: 10 out 10 stars

i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas. even star wars which is visually brilliant, has one of its central images, a futuristic "gang that couldn't shoot straight." imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons, most of them having an open shot, and they miss.i have read much science fiction, and wish there were more movies for the thinking person. forbidden planet, one of the earliest of the genre, is still one of the very best. the story is based on a long extinct civilization, the krell, who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps. unfortunately, what they hadn't bargained for, is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual. the primitive aspect of the brain, the id, as freud called it, is allowed to go unchecked. it is released in sleep, a bad dream come to corporeal existence. walter pigeon, dr. morbius, is the one who has jacked his brain to this level, and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind. his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend. the krell, a much superior species, could not stop it; it destroyed them. the landing party has never been of great interest to me. the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable. ann francis is beautiful and naive, and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male. her father's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties' astronauts (for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts). they are always trying to figure out "dames." the cook is a great character, with his obsession for hooch. robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew, and one wonders if mr. spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature. the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star. morbius can't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him. there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century.

forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . we meet the unforgetable robbie , the mysterious dr morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight . or did they ? you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron`s electronic music adds even more atmosphere i`m shocked this film isn`t in the top 250 imdb films .

great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often-slow movie enjoyable. at times it had me checking my watch, although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. the ending should surprise even those familiar with the nibelungen story line.

in "die nibelungen: siegfried", siegfried was betrayed. now, kriemhild seeks revenge. she marries hagen, and through a series of events, finally engages in a very drastic (but fitting) action at the end.one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals. attila the hun (called etzel in the movie) is shown as the strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the soviet union. obviously, it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used "the nibelungenlied" for german national pride in the third reich, but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story. nonetheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.

fritz lang's german medieval saga continues in die nibelungen: kriemhilds rache (1924).kriemhild (margarete schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, siegfried.her brother is too weak to bring the murdered, hagen, to justice.kriemhild marries etzel, the king of the huns (rudolf klein-rogge).she gives birth to a child, and invites her brothers for a party.etzel and the other huns should kil hagen, but he is protected by his brothers.we see a huge battle of life and death begins, and she sets the whole place on fire.eventually hagen is dead, and so is kriemhild.these movies deal with great themes, such as revenge and undying love.sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics, but this was one of the early ones.

i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema. i'd seen fritz lang's film on video some years ago. i'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic.conditions were ideal at cinematheque ontario. pristine full-length print. intertitles in the original gothic-script german with simultaneous english translation, accurate without being too literal. live piano accompaniment. ideal.the film's magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch, at least for me.this film bears no real relation to wagner's ring cycle as i already knew but some may not. wagner had adapted the 13th c. niebelungenlied to his own purposes. part i of fritz lang's epic -- "siegfried" -- has much that will be familiar to listeners of wagner however."kriemhild's revenge" is the story of siegfried's wife kriemhild, her marriage to king etzel (attila) the hun, and her desire for revenge against hagen and gunther, the rechristened nibelungs, for the murder of siegfried. the spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the wagnerian mythos into his götterdämmerung, his twilight of the gods, and the end of valhalla. this film remains earthbound.most of the film is spectacular. the massive sets rival those of "cabiria" (1914), which inspired griffith's "intolerance" (1916). their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour. there's a huge cast of scarred, mangy huns and art deco burgundians. and battles. battles that never seem to end in fact.kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge. she manages to destroy all around her. her loyalty to her martyred siegfried seems not to stem so much from love, or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. lady macbeth cried out, "unsex me here." she knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do. but kriemhild displays no normal human emotions, and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle. she is already "top full of direst cruelty", to borrow shakespeare's phrase, from the outset. margarethe schön and her director convey this with a glower. i don't want to exaggerate, but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to "animate" kriemhild's face. it's the ultimate in one-note performances. it's clearly intentional however, not simply a case of poor acting.what we have then on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging fury. some might see kriemhild as an empowered heroine. i just see the film as misogynistic.

in some ways, the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried's death, but it also loses some of that film's greatness. the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first, which is quite amazing. the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through, until, that is, you get to the climactic battle scenes; only the iliad's are better. lang and harbou embellished the huns. the poet-compiler of the nibelungenlied didn't know a hun from his right ball, and as a result they are, more or less, the same as the burgundians in custom. for example, although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen (which is kriemhild's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him), when she gets to hunland, the first thing she does is go to mass. the huns here are clearly heathens; they're almost like caveman. the depiction of them is hilarious, especially verbal, the jester, who has two marvelous scenes. etzel's character has been given more weight. he is much more formidable. all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem. lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense, especially at the banquet scene, which is intercut with verbal's second performance to an amazing effect. however, as is the nature of this half of the poem, the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one, for the most part, except for a dazzling sequence where etzel's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside. the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending. spoilers: in the poem, after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther, they are imprisoned. kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde. he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother. when hagen still refuses, she decapitates him. hildebrand (or possibly dietrich) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he, in turn, decapitates her, calling her a "devil woman". etzel, who is much weaker in the poem than he is here, says something silly like: "ah me!" i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic. i also understand why they didn't have hildebrand kill kriemhild: his character is much reduced here; his name is only mentioned once. but, to have kriemhild kill herself, adopting brynhild's death from the icelandic sources, is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them. the point of the poem is that kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil. here, we simply have her die for her lost love. it's not as interesting.

please see also my comment on die nibelungen part 1: siegfried.the second part of ufa studio's gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised, symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor. however, whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism, part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale.as in part one, director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm, with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands. these pictures should only be watched with the note-perfect gottfried huppertz score, which fortunately is on the kino dvd. now, with this focus on mass action, lang is presented with greater challenges in staging. the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed, but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow, with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra.but just as part one made us witness siegfried's adventures matter-of-factly and without excitement, part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy. in both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. that's why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action, never allowing us to feel as if we are there (and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of lang's work). that's also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical, with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers.nevertheless, kriemhild's revenge does constantly deal with emotions, and is in fact profoundly humanist. the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time, and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild, frantic ride of the huns. the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides, and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera. the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene. why then did hitler and co. get so teary-eyed over it, a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films? because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys, even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin. for hitler, their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy, not a human one.but for us non-nazi viewers, what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm. when you see these fully-developed silent pictures of lang's, it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood. rather than saddling him with low-budget potboilers, they should have put him to work on a few of those sword-and-sandal epics, pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to move us emotionally, where it's the poetic, operatic tonality that sweeps us along.

i saw this film last night at a special movie theater showing in nürnberg, and it was superb. i do have to admit that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion/xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had force in its portrayal of the tragic nibelungen saga.if you are interested in silent films or in the nibelungenlied, i highly recommend this film. the costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the acting was dramatic and breathtaking (as is typical of silent film "tragedies") unfortunately, i have not seen the first part of this film duo that concerns siegfried. the story of this second film begins after siegfried's death, when kremhild (gudrun in the norse versions of the story) begins to plan her revenge against her brothers.also, i watched this film in german; i am a native english speaker and have a basic german knowledge. it was difficult to read the ?subtitles (what do you call that in silent films?) at first because of the old style german script, so i advise that if you watch it in german that you make sure you can differentiate your "k's", "f's", and "s's" in the old script. :)

canto 1: how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attila woos her through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlarn: kriemhild (margarete schön) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband, hagen tronje (hans adalbert schlettow), but her brother, king gunther (theodor loos), refuses her request. when king attila of the huns woos kriemhild through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlar, she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her. hagen tronje hides the nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake.canto 2: how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland and how she was received by king attila: kriemhild brings some earth from where siegfried died, and travels to the court of the huns, where she is welcomed by attila himself, who also promises through oath to defend her.canto 3: how king attila besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers: when kriemhild delivers a baby boy, attila returns to his realm and asks kriemhild what she would like most to please her. she asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom.canto 4: how kriemhild receives her brothers: kriemhild insists on having the head of hagen tronje, but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request.canto 5: how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen: kriemhild asks attila to kill hagen tronje, but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert, a guest is considered sacred. kriemhild offers gold to the hums for the head of hagen tronje. there is a fight, and hagen tronje kills attila's son.canto 6: the nibelungen's distress: the huns lose the battle against the nibelungen, but keep them under siege inside attila's castle. kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver hagen tronje, but her brother gunther tells that german people are loyal with their friends.canto 7: the nibelungen's end: after the death of rüdiger von bechlarn, giselher and gernot, hagen tronje and guhther are finally captured. kriemhild kills hagen tronje, ending her revenge with the destruction of the nibelungen.the conclusion of the poetic saga of siegfried through "kriemhild's revenge" is also told through seven dramatic cantos. the nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate, revenge and loyalty. the solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters, the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of fritz lang produced another epic ahead of time. margarete schön is impressive with a total different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish. the costumes that kriemhild wears are also very impressive, and her acting is based on her face and look. i was a little disappointed with the reaction of attila after the death of his only son, since i found it too passive. my vote is eight.title (brazil): "os nibelungos  parte ii: a vingança de kriemshild" ("the nibelungen part ii: kriemhild's revenge")

have you ever, or do you have, a pet who's been with you through thick and thin, who you'd be lost without, and who you love no matter what? betcha never thought they feel the same way about you!wonderful, wonderful family film. if you have a soft spot for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age. i used to watch this movie all the time when i was a little kid, and i find that now, at age sixteen, i love it as much as i did then. i could never decide on a favorite character then, and i still don't think i can! i love all three of the animals. the dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving, but feuding family. i do love chance, and how at the end he says that he has a family at last. cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film, and it fulfills that role perfectly. sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young, adventurous chance.the animals way outshine the humans, but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie. rescuing molly, and the end). not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion, and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling. i give this 9/10. to be compared to (and even rated better than) cats and dogs and babe.

i am a fan of animal movies. if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over. homeward bound did just this. they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it. it was a complete success. it is very much an archetypal movie. you have the obi-wan of the group(shadow) who is wise and logical, you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting chance, and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised. these three personalities bounce off of each other very well. i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters, and they did not overdue it. most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film. what they are forgetting, however, is that it is supposed to be a kids film, and this still does not take away from the acual movie. this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie. it is a disney movie without the cartoons, an air bud movie with a better plot. i would, without a doubt, advise you to watch it.

this movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes. a true family film, homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good. shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment. chance - who wouldn't love a dog like chance? he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. and sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper; 'here kitty kitty kitty... not on your life, chubby.' there were also lots of well made emotional scenes, such as sassy going over the waterfall (i was truly scared for her), shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets return home... including good old shadow! a favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals. rent it or buy it now, and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime.

i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue. and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh. i think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film. however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was. but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow. and and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10.

i haven't seen the original "incredible journey" since i was a child, so i can't really compare the two versions. this version tells the story of three animals, two dogs and a cat, whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco. the pets, believing that they have been abandoned, escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness.this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon, but both versions are in fact live-action films made using real animals. one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices, giving each its own distinct personality, something that was not done in the original film. (a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as "racing stripes"). some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device, but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it. the animals were voiced by big-name stars, don ameche, michael j. fox and sally fields.both dogs are male, and their relationship parallels that between many humans in "buddy-buddy" movies. shadow, a golden retriever, is the wise, experienced older dog; chance the younger one is brash, cocky and impulsive. to british eyes chance looks like a boxer, but is actually an american bulldog, which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin. sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality. she is very proud of her status as a cat, which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog. ("cats rule, dogs drool!").from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults; it can be sentimental, some of the incidents (such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river) are quite incredible, and the human characters are all completely forgettable. this, however, is a film which is mainly aimed at children, and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely. certainly, any animal-loving child will do so. (comments by some professional critics such as james berardinelli, who complained that the animals' voices lessened the film's "grandeur", only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children's movies. i doubt if many playground conversations about "homeward bound" concentrated on its supposed grandeur).one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of california's sierra nevada mountains. they may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears, mountain lions and porcupines in the wilderness. this is a very enjoyable family film. 7/10

spoilers alerthomeward bound: the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. the story is based on the sheila burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone.the basic story: two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by shadow's instincts of direction. they meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. there are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).somehow though, i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily. the way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home, but shadow is nowhere to be seen. then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. hang on a second, i think i'm going to cry...anyway, i haven't read sheila burnford's book, so i don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. but this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it). this film is a masterpiece in cinema, and i suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it!and please avoid the sequel (see my review for homeward bound ii!)

first of all, i loved bruce broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm. the best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by michael j.fox, sally field and the late don ameche. whereas fox has the funniest lines, ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off. the humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. this is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of canada, i believe. although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. all in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. bethany cox.

this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy. it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name. chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all. it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far. it's a really good movie for families.

this is one of my favorite family movies. loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older. i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times. i never have much cared for animals talking, or at least un-animated ones but this one i'll stand up for. it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart.there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with, let alone like as much as this one. i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show. i really holds that great message that" home is where the heart is." or at least that's the message i gained from it. definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.

this is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home.old and wise golden retriever shadow, young american bulldog chance and himalayan cat sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family.homeward bound: the incredible journey (1993) is a family adventure directed by duwayne dunham.it's a remake of a 1963 film.this movie got a sequel three years later.michael j. fox is the perfect man to do the voice-over for chance.fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role.sally field does great voice work as sassy.don ameche is fantastic as shadow.this was this veteran actor's second last movie.also the visible actors are great.kim greist plays laura burnford-seaver.robert hays is bob seaver.benji thall plays peter burnford.veronica lauren is hope burnford.kevin chevalia is jamie seaver.jean smart portrays kate.it's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness.we see sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner.the bear scene is exiting and funny.chance has no chance with that big, hungry bear.and his meeting with the porcupine looks painful.this is some great fun for the whole family.

great voices, lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie. the addition of "character" to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older fellow, shadow, and the young hellraiser, chance. the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is done perfectly here. sally field is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, sassy. great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. hats off to disney.

this is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. i cry every time i see shadow yelling "wait, wait for me peter!" as the family car is pulling away. this is a must see if you love animals! best movie ever! the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. like when sassy says to chance; "cat's rule and dogs drool!" lines like this i could do without, but when i was six i bet i loved that line. the storyline may seem hooky to some, but i like it. shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. it reminded me of my childhood dog. i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "homeward bound."

this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are. i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit. it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking abilities.put humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out. for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed. only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into murder,proving that,after all,animals are more interesting than people

hey guys, i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area. (i am australian). could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from. in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. it was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager. it is a great movie for the whole family. my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it. i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on dvd.sally

i really liked the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is incredible.go watch the movie. you will enjoy it.i could have given it ranking more than 10.i liked the teasing between chance and sassy.i like the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was perfect.its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film.chance was full of humor.sassy is an intelligent cat.again i say this movie is a must watch.the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie.this movie is a classic.

this is a really cool movie! i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week...shadow was my favorite character in the movie. homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things. parts of the movie are sad though (such as when sassy, the cat, falls down the waterfall, and when shadow falls in the hole at the end.) i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first. shadow is the smart one, sassy is, well, sassy, and chance is the funny idiot. i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies, or talking animals. this is one of my top ten favorite movies!

there have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'homeward bound: the incredible journey' is neither.this film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. it has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should).homeward bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of bruce broughton), and an impressive cast...michael j. fox ... chancesally field ... sassydon ameche ... shadowfrank welker (voice god) ... variousit is a modernised version of the children's classic work of fiction 'the incredible journey', which was made into a semi-documentary film by disney long long ago in 1963. the sequel (lost in san fransisco) isn't nearly as good a film, but extends the adventure of my favourite furry-footed friends, and is a fun urban-twist on the grand-outdoor-adventure theme. want to entertain your children with a witty, pretty, heart-warming mini-epic, without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? parents, buy all three films for your children - now! thank you, disney, for bringing a tear to my eyes with each time i watch this early-90s classic!

"homeward bound: the incredible journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets. deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general, together with other animal movies like "old yeller", "napoleon", "fluke" and "air bud". this means it is more than just a movie about pets.can this possibly be just a "remake"? it is too good to be a "remake"! i know this one by heart, since my early teen years (when i was 12).it's a family movie to treasure. it's emotional, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heartwarming and sometimes dramatic. it's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films.this movie does not lack qualities. it has a well thought story, enjoyable characters, excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains (in oregon). speaking of the vistas, it's not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets... in conclusion, all of pure nature's wonders - truly a full panorama. the main human characters are nice, well developed and well portrayed by respective actors. robert hays is awesome as the kind-hearted dad, bob seaver. kim greist is good as laura burnford. veronica lauren is equally good as hope. kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie (his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in "old yeller"). benj thall is great as peter burnford.when it comes to our quadruped pals, shadow is my favorite. shadow is the loyal, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old golden retriever (brilliantly voiced by don ameche). chance, the american bulldog, is the opposite of shadow. he is carefree, silly, impatient, anxious, clumsy, hilarious and loves to play (voiced by the talented michael j. fox). chance just can't stand still. sassy is the epitome of cats's image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm. sassy is a seal point himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cat breeds. sassy is voiced by sally field, who also does a good job.our four-legged friends are, themselves, great "actors" by nature: ben as shadow, rattler as chance and tiki as sassy.it's an underrated movie, but a classic by its own right. its sequel is clearly inferior.this should definitely be on top 250.

very few so called "remakes" can be as good as the originals. this one crosses that border with flying colors. just a remake, i don't think so! i saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film. the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. this update is more epic and cinematic. still, i thoroughly recommend both films.this film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. we have the wise old golden retriever, shadow; the sharp, sarcastic himalayan cat, sassy; and the young, fun-loving american bulldog, chance. the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche, sally field, and michael j. fox, respectively.there is virtually nothing offensive in the film. there is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. no hard violence, save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine, and a dark railroad shaft.hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards, not one. nevertheless, i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays.

i've seen this about 2 or 3 times and haven't regretted it. homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie. its unique, fun and bursting with adventure. the things that make it a fun movie are the animals (obvious)who are wonderfully trained. a very good effort.8.5/10!

it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs. fox, field, and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance, sassy and shadow, and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing.i have seen this movie 72 times already (i know that sounds scary, but it's true!), and every time the ending scenes still get me. i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers. it is indeed my all-time favorite movie!

this movie was awesome...it made me laugh, it make a bawl, and most of all it has talking animals in it!! this movie should be seen by all kinds of people! it is one of my favorite movies, and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on it!!!it rox! it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt movie!my favorite character is shadow. this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming. i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow, i miss him so much!!! he was my best friend and i knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but i miss him with all of my heart!! this movie is the best i love it and everyone should! love your pets no matter what they do, cherish them forever!!!

as a kid i thought this movie was great. it had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: michael j. fox. now, i still love this movie, for different reasons. it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. it has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. even when people hum it. and it has my favorite actor, michael j. fox. based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, chance. the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. a truly incredible journey. so what, maybe home is just over that mountain. but what if it isn't? i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ... yeah, everyone go watch it.

this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made. it's a real pleaser to anyone. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.basically, what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. they don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in. he provided the voice of shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy, the himalayan cat. but seriously, what this movie is all about is chance! voiced by michael j. fox (my all-time favorite actor), chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time i crack up when watching this movie, it's because of chance; it's like the comedy never ends! this movie is also very sad at times. it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. the movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.overall, it's a wonderful family movie. if you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!

i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special. as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film, which i will come to later. for a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while. when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), i dug out the vhs of homeward bound. after watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain. the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground, something that you all need. the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic. in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever, looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but confident cat. the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen. i don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return, when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy, painfully are told by him to leave. when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all. there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10.

homeward bound is a beautiful film. y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch... thingy, i *cried*, considering i was only six, i cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! the dogs and the cat are excellently trained. a nice family movie, *not* for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap a.k.a. people like me.a good film overall, 10/10!

this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. the voices for the animals are wonderful. sally field and michael j. fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is don ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (happy tears!)

this is a great movie for all ages. its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. you never know what is going to happen next. this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. you just don't know what going to happen next. the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will!

i watch this movie all the time. i've watched it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; they all loved it. it really shows the true scenes a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. just beautiful.it's great for thoes who love comedy movies, the tear-jerker movies, or even just pets.the music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes truly thought out, and the characters perfect. what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities: shadow (the oldest, a golden retriever) he's the wise one, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog, chance (the american bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comical character; and sassy (the hymilayan cat) she's the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.

maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5, and i cried my eyes out. between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. don't worry they're tears of happiness! and it's not all sap! there's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. my only word of advice: even if you love this-don't see the sequal...cornyness! i suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!

i couldn't have been more thrilled; just eight years old back in 1983, i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater! the best day of my life was about to happen. to that time, my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars. i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet.and boy, did that day deliver for my less critical eyes. jabba. big rebel spaceships. the emporer. a green-bladed lightsaber!! wow! since that magical day, i must have watched this movie hundreds of times. i can't even form an accurate estimate at this point. with those multiple viewings, i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws.of course in the context of a star wars movie, those "flaws" are more like "quirks".millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. in may of 1983, i had mine. and this was my star wars movie.

i bought this game on ebay having heard that it was a similar game to elite. the gameplay is indeed very similar, and is very addictive. once i'd played it a couple of times, i immediately went back on ebay and bought copies for all my kids so they could join in the fun too.... i have played this game right through and the storyline makes it feel as if you are actually in a movie, it's brilliant. if you have trouble feeling free to explore because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game, simply set up a freelancer server on your own pc (easy to do and the software is included) and play to your heart's content. there are still a huge number of freelancer servers on the internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatening, because you don't often meant other players unless you want to. so go get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. the depth of this game is staggering, with huge systems to explore and wrecks to find, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, wormholes, secret bases, the list is nearly endless. fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay. get one with the full written manual if you can (blue box, not xplosiv red box), it's loads better!

this is a great game! okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital anvil have still come up with a good game. there is a certain similarity to elite(you can trade, pick up weapons and cargo off destroyed ships, go on missions)however this game features a heavily scripted mission. it is a great mission. the control system is different it uses the mouse! you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up! the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003. it should run well on even a modestly specified pc. the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies, george takei, jennifer hale(she appears in every computer game). stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on. there is even a race section, where you and an opponent have to race your spaceships around a course(it involves you going through rings). this section took me a while to beat. it adds variety to the game. some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game. the game has an active mod scene on the net. pick up some mods to extend the game. i haven't played any of the mods yet. sadly a sequel to this was cancelled, a shame!

this game is very addictive, i kept playing it for hours straight until late at night but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space contributed to this, at times i just had to play on in order not to loose any game data.so yes, "freelancer" is addictive but also quite flawed. also for instance, something that extremely bothered me was that you couldn't skip any of the cut scene's with as a result that at times you had to watch the same few minute cut scene time after time. a great opportunity for me to multitask to check my e-mail or have a chat with my friends and more things like that, while i had to wait for the cut scene to be over.the story starts of promising but the further you get the more ridiculous it all gets. also the game also ends quite abrupt, at least it did so for me. it is quite obvious that they are hinting at a upcoming sequel. i don't know if a sequel is in the works at the moment but i am sure that most likely i will pick one up once it will be released.the gameplay is very easy! even for those who are not familiar with flight games. to put it boldly, every fool can play this game. yes, some levels are quite hard and require lots of effort. it took me about 1-2 weeks for me to finish this game which might be a bit too short. but thank god for the multi-player option! it allows you to keep playing short missions, just like the single player game once you have completed it by the way.even though lot's of mission are the same, it just simply stays cool to be in the middle of the at times massive dogfights.the graphics are good but just not anything revolutionary or anything.addictive game but beware of its flaws.7/10

i suppose jedi is now chronologically to be considered the very "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. i liked how directly this sequel took off after the empire strikes back, and i appreciated the maturity of luke skywalker as a character(and also mark hamill, as an actor). after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks, they weren't so bad. i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and i felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. the ending (with some new additions, i presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know, i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. oh, and, err -- carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.

i previously thought that this film was the lamest of the muppet films. i would like now to retract that statement. in my opinion now, the lamest muppet film was the tv movie it's a very merry muppet christmas, am it's a wonderful life rip off that was truly dreadful. muppets take manhattan is nothing special, but miles more enjoyable than merry muppet christmas. the best songs are that 'you can't take no for an answer' song, the one the muppet babies sing and the songs for the big finale itself. as i loved the muppet babies tv show, i loved the muppet babies sequence here (i'm told that it was what inspired the muppet babies show) the manhattan melodies show itself was the real showstopper, with muppets from sesame street even appearing for the wedding. as kermit puts it in his final line 'what better way could anything end?'. but i wish that what was between the beginning and end was a bit more entertaining. there are cute cameos from brooke shields and gregory hines and a great dance sequence from rizzo and the rats (choreographed by the late, great jim henson himself) and the film certainly entertains. i must state though that muppet movie, great muppet caper and muppet christmas carol are the three defininitive muppet movies.

this was the best muppet movie i've seen ever! i happen to know that miss piggy's fantasy of meeting as infants was the cause of muppet babies. the songs will remain in my head forever. only saying so because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head. sorry, a little off the topic there. but anyway what i like is animal after the credits saying "bye bye! bye bye! bye bye! bye bye! bye bye! hasta luego!" that made me laugh so hard. my absolute favorite is the play at the end. i was surprised that the sesame street characters popped in at the wedding. i'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. i borrowed it from the library, and now i have bought it because i can't keep the library's copy forever. in conclusion, i proclaim this is the best movie i've ever seen! in my case, it's even better than austin powers in goldmember, which was my favorite movie!

as far as the muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. this was marketed towards the kiddies, but has some dark, and emotionally upsetting adult moments, to which parents may not wish to expose their children. one of which showcases miss piggy going "postal" in a jealous rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and highly entertaining. one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun.i like this very much, and enjoy it still today.it rates a 7.6/10 from...the fiend :.

yes, it's another great magical muppet's movie and i adore them all; the characters, the movies, the tv show episodes (it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever) and all the artists behind it. but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending !! i think it's very dangerous to involve that much, in american drama, and end a love affair by marriage !! we, as all the poor viewers, feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance, peevishness and misery ! so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie, superman and lois lane, dick tracy and tess, etc. so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe, serenity and peace. therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me !they made the weak miserable creature (kermit) marry his daily nightmare, the most vexatious female ever (miss piggy) ! this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment's industry ! and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage (even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything !). therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious, grossing only 25 millions vis-à-vis 65 millions earned by the first one (the muppet movie  1979) five years earlier !!simply in this movie they took manhattan, and my rest too !

but if you like the muppets i defy you to dislike this one. basically the same plot regurgitated (this time new york, not la) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. a lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around kermy and miss piggy. i happened to have enjoyed it greatly. fun to watch with your kids.

i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up. the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way. my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant. this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike. long live kermit, miss piggy and the rest of the gang.

don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) it does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good characters - well it does star the muppets, a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) what is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together.* the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy!!!!

stars: julianna donald, lonny price and louis zorich. cameos: art carney, brooke sheilds, liza minelli, james coco, joan rivers, dabney coleman, linda lavin, gregory hines and others.muppeteers: jim henson as kermit, rowlf, dr.teeth, swedish chef, waldorf, ernie and others.richard hunt as scooter, janice, statler and beaker.frank oz as fozzie bear, miss piggy, animal, bert, cookie monster and sam the eagle.jerry nelson as camilla the chicken, floyd pepper, lew zealand, crazy harry and pops.dave goelz as gonzo, zoot, beuregard and bunsen hunnydew.steve whittemire as rizzo the rat and others.another great muppet flick. this time, kermit, fozzie, miss piggy, scooter, rowlf, the electric mayhem, gonzo and camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they're trying to get on broadway. after miserably failing at getting it produced, they all split up and go their separate ways. i love the characters and cameos. the songs in the film are "together again", "look at me, here i am", "saying goodbye", "and i'm going to always love you", "rat jazz" and "he'll make me happy". frank oz directs this movie excellently and all the actors do a great job acting like the muppets are real. see it! 91 minutes. rated g. my rating: a.

in this muppet movie, kermit, miss piggy, fozzie, gonzo, rowlf, scooter, camillia, dr. teeth, floyd, animal, janice, and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical, manhattan melodies, to broadway. unfortunately, no producer will even meet with the muppets. after being denied by too many producers, scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own. however, kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway, but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show, kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is.this features many great scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies, a wedding sequence filled with muppets, including the sesame street cast and traveling matt (from fraggle rock), scooter as a movie theatre usher, and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast.my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more. sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen, beaker, beauregard, and sweetums, and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper, and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well (after all, rizzo the rat, also performed by steve whitmire, had a big part in this movie, and he wasn't very well-known at the time).

"the muppets take manhattan" is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far. for one, it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney. as of 2008, the film still belongs to 20th century fox (cbs fox at the time of its release) even though disney owns the rights to the muppets. also, this film has a story line that's very non-linear, and events that are otherwise unpredictable.of course, it's very hard to beat the original "muppet movie" from 1979, especially since that movie had more memorable songs than "manhattan" does. however, one way in which "the muppets take manhattan" is better than "the muppet movie" is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios. in the first movie, all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood, walk into an agent's office, and they are immediately given a "rich & famous" contract. in this movie, the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success, and it's a lot harder to do that, especially in the entertainment business, than they initially thought. that's an important and often times overlooked message, provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets, being small and made of cloth, don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively. above all, their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story. another note: the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool, and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets. that ability right there is a testament to henson, and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults.where "manhattan" falls flat, and this is where i'm sure people will disagree with me, is with some of the key songs, especially in the end. i thought the wedding song "he'll make me happy" was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding. it sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral. every time i watch this movie, hearing that song makes me unusually depressed, especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as "together again" and ends happily for that matter. "saying goodbye" was a sad number too, but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again. that last song was such a let down, and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen."the muppets take manhattan" is overall a good film, and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films, including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt. fortunately, the film marches in the same direction as well. i just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy. plus, disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper dvd release. maybe it will someday. we'll see.

i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished. the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious. he is about to be destroyed when darth vader, dark lord of the sith, eliminates his dark master. a nice sacrifice. the cinematography of this film is impressive. i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers. i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (lando's co pilot) and many more... most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker (sebastian shaw)(the greatest scene in star wars) 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord.i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v.s luke skywalker on the death star. post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.

i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie, because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written, but along the way, they run into the usual problems, including kermit's memory loss here. while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original "muppets movie," there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman. simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great, and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious. the original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. there is not much else to say about the film, but muppet fans should see it for sure. it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all.***1/2 out of ****

the third muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing, with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright (yet volatile) lights of broadway filled with typically naïve optimism. of course, their first attempt fails and kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so, the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them. kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner (the old man, then, has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!). we get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: art carney (as a producer), james coco (as an overzealous dog owner), dabney coleman (as a confidence trickster), elliott gould (who was also in the muppet movie [1979]), gregory hines, liza minnelli (as herself  having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by kermit's, sporting fake moustache, as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the muppets' show), brooke shields, and even director john landis (in possibly the film's funniest scene as a broadway producer before whom kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an afro wig!). the other muppets more or less go through their typical paces, with (regrettably) less space given to gonzo this time around; while miss piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be kermit's romance with the waitress  and especially her violent reaction to this  are undeniably funny. what disappoints, however, is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on madison avenue) which, rather than the expected splashy routines, procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of kermit and his eternal flame miss piggy!

jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. this film makes me feel like a kid again. okay, the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends. the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city. you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch. anyway, the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang. the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city. it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.

this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim henson was around to take part in the making of before his premature death in 1990. the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born. i originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy, "the muppet movie" and "the great muppet caper", around the mid-nineties, as a kid, but didn't see this third one, "the muppets take manhattan", until april 2007. this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and 1996's "muppet treasure island" for the first time in many years. this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it, and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much, but if not, it certainly didn't go too far downhill.the muppets' stage musical, "manhattan melodies", turns out to be a big hit on their college campus. they are graduating from college, so they will soon be leaving, but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway. after their arrival, they begin searching for a producer, but after many rejections, they finally decide to part and go find jobs. most of them leave town, but kermit stays, and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang. he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete. the frog quickly befriends pete's daughter, jenny, an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress. as kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom, now with the help of jenny, he doesn't know that miss piggy has secretly stayed in new york and is now spying on him. she begins to see kermit and jenny together, and to her it looks like they're getting close, which leads to jealousy! when i saw this movie for the second time, it looked disappointing at first. it seemed a little rushed, unfocused, and maybe even forgettable around the beginning. there are some funny bits during this part of the film, such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus, but for a little while, the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors. fortunately, it wasn't long before that changed. the film is entertaining for the most part, with "saying goodbye", the poignant song the muppets sing as they part, and a lot that happens after that. the two funniest parts might be miss piggy's tantrums after she sees kermit and jenny hugging, but there were definitely many other times when i laughed, such as poor fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears. the muppets still have their charm and comical antics, which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part, as does the plot, a simple but intriguing one for all ages. there are some weaker moments, such as the muppet babies sequence, and juliana donald's performance as jenny is lacklustre, but neither of these problems are too significant, and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience.i would say "the muppet movie", the film that started the franchise in 1979, is the best of the original trilogy, and that seems to be the most popular opinion. this third film is probably the weakest of the three, but all of them are good. unlike "muppets from space", the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after henson's sad passing, at least "the muppets take manhattan" is still the muppets! i won't go into details about what i think of the muppets' 1999 film, released twenty years after their first one, since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing, and even though it does have some appeal, i'm clearly not alone. however, every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family, even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it.

when i first saw this film in the 1980's, i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the "sesame street/muppets" age. i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not. however, somewhere in college i watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal best films ever collection.this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets. i mean, obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations. but come on...janice is accidentally overheard telling someone "i don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it is artistic"...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says "i think we're engaged now"...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. add to that very smart dialogue, very smart new york/broadway "wink wink" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on "kid-level cheesy" whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! i don't throw "10"'s out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. the muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. ---q

i love this film. the songs and story lines are great fun. and the song "saying goodbye" always moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life, in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever. great voices and great talent. why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting, moving and funny? is it that mr. henson is just so very missed?

throughout this film, you might think this film is just for kids. well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. this time around, the muppet gang try to get on broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. but kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia! it's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (lou zealand's boomerang fish; gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! cameos include liza minneli ("a frog?"), elliot gould (as the cop), brooke shields (propositioned by a rat), edward i. koch, gregory hines and joan rivers. so get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best muppet movies.

as most off you might off seen star wars: return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one (live tv) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader (real name: anakin skywalker) when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground

no, there is another !because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i, ii & iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy, i will state the good points of "the return of the jedi" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. of course, i loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but this has been overly debated elsewhere.what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - a strong ecological concern - anti-militarist positions - fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force - cute creatures - harrison ford's smile - a killer scene : near the ending, when vader looks alternatively at his son and at the emperor. the lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his black helmet. and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke, thereby risking his own life ! oh, boy !what is wrong in the prequel inmho : - the whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - the force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom - too many jedis at once and too many light sabers on the screen - the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot by the way, if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by obi web (obi wen, i mean) and yoda, then you should read a few books about buddhism and the forms it took in ancient japan.the magic of star wars, imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice, from a father to his son, albeit the difficulties. "de mon âme à ton âme", (from my soul to yours), as would write bejard to the late zen master t. deshimaru.

"return of the jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the star wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. it manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.yes, there are ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the star wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where luke finally comes face to face with darth vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.return of the jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the "empire strikes back" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at jabba's palace, a masterful performance of ian mcdiarmid as the emperor, luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of solo and leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the endor moon.yes, there are slight annoyances. but they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. it's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. it's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!

star wars: episode 4 .the best star wars ever. its the first movie i ever sean were the bad guys win and its a very good ending. it really had me wait hing for the next star wars because so match stuff comes along in this movie that you just got to find out more in the last one. whit al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don bedder but not whit this one. and i will never ever forget the part were wader tels luke he is his father.way too cool. also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player. if you never ever saw a star wars movie you go to she this one.its the best.thanks lucas

dear readers,the final battle between the rebellion and empire. the second death star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the rebel alliance. luke skywalker, now a jedi knight, returns from tatooine with han solo and princess leia, now revealed as luke's twin sister! they agree to lead the attack on the shield generator on the forest moon of endor while lando calrissian leads the attack on the death star. little do they know that a most ingenious trap has been laid for them and the emperor palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the second death star.return of the jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. it's got action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fight scenes, and awesome music by john williams. mark hamill is fully matured now into a jedi knight, gone is the naive farm-boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed jedi determined to save the galaxy. leia is still cool in this film as well as han and lando. 3p0, r2, and chewie do their roles to a t while james earl jones still is cinema's greatest villain: darth vader. ian mcdiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and brutally ruthless emperor palpatine. the action sequences of this movie are breathtakingly amazing and the sword fights are serious and gritty. john williams's score is still cool and enhances the film by several levels.signed, the constant dvd collector

i only wish that return of the jedi, have been directed by somebody else, i mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. besides this time our heroes look like different people: princess leia no longer fights with solo, luke looks boring, darth vader is not as evil as before, and yoda just dies.but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence. 3-the emperor (now that's evil) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-the last battle. 6-the dark side seduction scene. 7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force. 8- and the last celebration.some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. if some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.

brilliant movie. the drawings were just amazing. too bad it ended before it begun. i´ve waited 21 years for a sequel, but nooooo!!!

it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr. i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase. bakshi's work is quite true to the original work. the visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting.drawbacks? occasionally, the movie is confusing or muddled. there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl. but, overall -- buy this movie. it's great for kids, adults and collectors.

if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head. the representation of hobbits, dwarves etc have had the 'disney' treatment. the dark riders are excellent, and as i had always imagined from the books.cinematically this is an excellent film, mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. i only wish he (bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic.it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings !!

i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night. i've been a fan of tolkien's work for about 4 years now, ever since i got out of high school. i didn't grow up on this movie...perhaps my mother kept me away from it. it's definitely not for children. not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads. overall, the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978/1979. i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense. but i am bothered that bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts. that would've made it the ultimate movie. i was bothered by it's abrupt end, and then when i heard return of the king sucked, i was bothered even more. too bad it wasn't one great animation film. it might have garnered a higher vote from me. i give it a 7. i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr.

one thing i can say about this movie is well long, very long! i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out. i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's (even though i never lived in them) is actually one of my favourite decades, especially for the music! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive. i will admitt the animation did impress me! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see. but the movie honestly could of been a bit better, it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting. then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion i thought it was extremely long. i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it seem like it was 4 hours long!!!! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those "nothing to do days". i will see the new one and i hope it is better!

i recently rented the animated version of the lord of the rings on video after seeing the fantastic 2001 live action version of the film. the lord of the rings live action trilogy directed by peter jackson will undoubtably be far better than george lucas' star wars "prequel" trilogy (episodes 1-3) will ever be as the real fantasy film series of the 21st century!i remember seeing the animated version as a child, and i didn't quite understand the depth of the film at that time. now that i have read the books, i understand what the whole storyline is all about. to be sure, some of the characters are quite silly, (samwise gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as jar jar binks in star wars episode one, (awful!)) but, i have to say it follows the book rather closely, and it goes into part of book two, the two towers. the good things are that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is quite remarkable for it's time. the bad things are that it ends upruptly halfway through the two towers without any result of frodo's quest to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks quite dated compared to today's standards. overall, not as bad as many say it is. but, the 2001 live action version is the new hallmark of the lord of the rings! at least ralph bakshi took the script seriously! peter jackson has said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn caused him to create one of the greatest fantasy series ever put on film, so we can at least thank ralph bakshi for that matter! i'll take the animated version of lord of the rings over the live version of harry potter anyday!a 7 out of a scale of 1-10, far less violent than the 2001 live action version, but nowhere near as good! for diehard fans of the books and film versions of the lord of the rings.

there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net. those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious. i'm inclined to be in the middle. i'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film (e.g.the cruel cutting of the story, badly rotoscoped charecters, over acting etc...) but dispite this i still love this film. the rotoscoping (when done properly)adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic. the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score... magic. sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film.(no doubt i'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review, ah well, such is life)

i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv, long before a live-action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson's eye... and being very impressed. finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away (and isn't that just par for the course..?) i had the chance to revisit this film, and found that it still stands up quite well, although it's not quite the success that memory had painted.i have to confess to a certain bias here. some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson-lovers, others as jackson-haters; i'm not exactly either. i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981, and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here -- peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note-perfect for the radio three years later.i must say, however, that where i found jackson's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment, the bakshi version, for all that it has been cut to the bone, is actually more accurate. yes, there are the usual, understandable changes (here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party) and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action. (the only exception to the latter, as others have remarked, is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell, where the ringwraiths, having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid-flight -- which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river -- then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop, which is initially nightmarish but pointless, plot-wise, and definitely goes on too long.) i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory, due partly to bad animation, and that gandalf windmills his arms too much.but having watched both approaches to the film, i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take. in a tale that is half-myth (oddly enough, one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn's story of beren and luthien) the extreme literalism required by live-action filming, where everything from monsters to mail-shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera, is counter-productive: latex-faced (or cgi) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily-drawn shapes, heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies, and hobbits or dwarfs with non-human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly. many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods, with its crippled, half-human movements, as one of the scariest moments in the film -- it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark!the extreme stylisation of the introduction (plus a voice-over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back-story in a few sentences) works very well to depict an almost mythical era, and the change to the comic-book rusticism of the shire -- i particularly like the proudfeet -- corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien's prose. i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect: gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes, bilbo seeming to become a gollum-like creature under the influence of ring-lust at rivendell, and galadriel's famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight, where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits' changed perceptions. but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette -- firelight hues at bree, bright colours re-emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing, dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands -- work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes, where a live-action approach simply doesn't allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting.as a fan i didn't care for either jackson's or bakshi's depiction of lothlorien -- again, i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i've come across of a beautiful, slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time -- and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong, but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria. aragorn giving a hobbit-fencing-lesson here is as charming (and equally uncanonical) a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version.the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film (viggo mortensen's scruffy jesus look really didn't work for me), although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to 'clean up' the character in the second half for gondor's benefit. john hurt, unsurprisingly, gives a sterling vocal performance, as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf. the hobbits are, i suspect, intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience-identification figures: i find the animated style (their proportions are much more 'cartoonish' than those of the human characters) works well to differentiate them, and the whole 'hairy feet' thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions, including much fan art.personally i have less objection to boromir as viking -- he was always a fairly bludgeoning type -- than to beardy-aragorn (illogical: they were both numenorians, after all), although i am clearly in a minority here!the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project, with a bizarre tacked-on voice-over ending attempting to resolve matters. a pity; it would have been interesting, not to mention less frustrating, to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith, never mind the dead...

with the release of peter jackson's famed "lord of the rings" trilogy, it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshi's 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior. i agree with the majority that jackson's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkien's work, but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi's ambitious pioneering effort. jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations.the film's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable. i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters. the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually, the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive, but these points didn't bother me very much. however, the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie. the only character representation i was bothered by was sam's; he was made to look unbecomingly silly.this film is novel for its animation techniques. in addition to hand-drawn characters, live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping. it is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped, but none the less i found that the film's style was a novelty. the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well.the voice acting was generally of high quality. particularly good was john hurt, who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn. aragorn isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories, but backed by john hurt's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation. my other favorite was william squire, whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf. the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam, whose voice acting was irritating and added to sam's unfortunately silly image. the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names. particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as "aruman".in producing this film, ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films. hence, this film contains about half the story, from the start of "the fellowship of the ring" to the end of the battle at helm's deep in "the two towers". the obvious implication of this is that the film's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books. i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations, but the liberties taken to compress the story didn't bother me, even the choice to leave arwen out of the story. enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes. the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helm's deep were tremendous.ralph bakshi's version of "the lord of the rings" isn't perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story. however, for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy. my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this "first great tale" of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel.

a very good movie. a classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything. this movie offers a greater number of aliens. we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces. the emperor is somewhat an original character. i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese. (excellent references) i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga. in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls. i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi-wan. it gives a sadness and a tear. the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie: when vader turns on the emperor. luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi-wan, yoda and...his father (1997 version not hayden christenssen). the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia. there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending. i felt there was much more than meets the eye. and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe.

when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. should the ring end up back in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy middle earth. frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film.the animation is superbly done with rotoscope, which is tracing over live action footage. ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene. there are a few plot holes with the script, but that has to be excused, considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films, much had to crammed in the first one. my biggest gripe is some of the character design, samwise was a bit too goofy, while the other hobbits act completely normal. the other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot. the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening, while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish.another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman, thanks to the writers. overall, i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories. the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.

peter jacksons version(s) are better films overall from objective point of view. that being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings, and let me explain why. firstly, the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson's lotr. the whole cast is too run of the mill. "are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people?" one could ask. well, they are not really silly(save for hobbits, later about them) and they certainly pack more personality than jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time. and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshi's lotr. take aragorn for example. in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority(aragorn the lord)and with a seasoned rasp(aragorn the ranger). this is due to john hurt's brilliant voice acting. compare that to viggo mortensen's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven: hurt beats mortensen hands down. and then there is gandalf. probably the most dominating(and the most popular) character in the whole saga. in this bakshi version gandalf(william squire) is a real wizard. and by that i don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips(he does not), but his presence is just captivating. he is a mystical, powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease. add to that his looks: tall, old as the ancient oak, beard long as his body, sharp eyes, wizardy hook nose and of course, the classical wizard hat. a perfect gandalf, just like in the books. ian mckellen's gandalf in the other hand, is simply just too boring. he looks too human, sounds too human, acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword. yes a sword. in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword(as he did in the books). and those are stylish slow motion kills. gandalf is not a power to be messed with. and it must be noted, that while i'm sad to say this, the great christopher lee didn't bring saruman alive. fraser kerr in this movie did, even with a very limited screen time and lines.before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie, it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson's pretendeous bad guys. bakshi's orcs taunt their enemies(or each other) constantly with growls, screams and nasty language. they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. and finally, the black riders - or the nazgul. those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black. and they speak with haunting voice, which mesmerizes their victim. my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river. while peter jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party, bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky.but as much i like this film more than jackson's, the latter are, if only technically, still better. and that is because of some key visuals. as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters(all hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered with paint. i don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way, but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. this is especially true with humans(riders of rohan, tavern people etc.) orcs are different matter, since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters. orcs, while played by humans with animation mix, look far superior to jacksons version. they have brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. biggest screw up in this films visuals, howerver, are the hobbits. while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson, the latter has clearly superior hobbits, in fact they are perfect. with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies. and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. again, the voice acting is ok with them too, but the actors mouths cannot save the "immersion damage" made by these little weasels. well, i never really liked those halflings anyway. general failures in the bakshi script are well known. limited playing time(with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes. so while this film covers nearly half of the story, it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to jackson's version. in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior:-overall atmosphere (it feels more like middle-earth) -overall voice acting -music (i really dig the fantasy score by kont & rosenman) -gandalf -aragorn (one of the john hurt's finest roles) -king theoden -orcs -black riders -elrond (he's not some fairy hippie in this one!)while jackson version is better:-because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -gollum/smeagol -balrog -hobbitslord of the rings by ralph bakshi, even with it's well known shortcomings, is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly. i'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10.

i happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold, dark november afternoon. i was outside playing all day, freezing, and when i came in around 4pm, i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket. i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly--and was in fact dark, and moralistic. it captured my imagination. i'm sure it misses the text, and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist. but it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to carry a burden for the good of others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, etc. the quality of animation leaves room for complaint. but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations. john hurt is great in this. if you don't like how the character is drawn, look away, and just listen to him. his voice is extraordinary. i've seen it again many, many times and it always brings me back to that time, as a kid, thirsty for some magical adventure. it's for this reason i say 'lucky', the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings. but between john hurt, and tolkien's fantasy, it still reached me, and still does.

my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king. so i finally bought it off e-bay, thinking right from the start it was going to suck. actually, it really wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. the animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood.not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, i've seen a lot worse. it skips quite a lot of things, since both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into one two hour movie. definatley worth a watch, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparision with the peter jackson trilogy.

first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like tolkien. this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies. and while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. the background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. if you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see.

i'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many "reviewers" rank it below the peter jackson trilogy. a filmed novel is always interpretive; in particular an animated film relies on the artist's vision and should be judged on its own terms. speaking as a purist, this is a finer homage to tolkien than the updated version. while this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source, especially so far as the characters are concerned.in the jackson version tolkien's frodo is barely recognizable: from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling, constantly wavering, manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet (this is physically and metaphorically true.) you wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom. jackson unforgivably rewrites tolkien and robs frodo of his finest moment when he allows arwen to rescue him from the ringwraiths...bakshi's version respects the original, presenting a frodo who demands the wraiths "go back and trouble me no more!" bakshi sustains frodo's character as tolkien conceived it. we see his decline as the weight of his burden increases. frodo is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties (he does so with numerous characters)since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion. bakshi's film better explores the companionship between legolas and gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in jackson's version. similarly we see boromir horsing with pippin and merry, furthering the idea of fellowship. for my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action.tolkien's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes: when frodo sings the "merry old inn" song, minutes before stumbling into strider. the cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later, invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths, frodo is dangerously exposed. this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it.the well documented budget/time restrictions limit this film's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers. as it is, it's worth a look. even its detractors admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype.

first of all, the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being "altered". well guess what? peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either. well enough ranting. this is a very beautiful film. the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists. the film covers about half the trilogy (fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers) and moves at a good pace. the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would. samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes, but aragorn looks awesome. the film has a great score that completely supports the movie. if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) give this movie a try, keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago.also of particular note: peter jackson's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi's (jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort).

godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one, and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi's take on tolkien's magnum opus the lord of the rings, has actually been made by peter jackson. the recent trilogy, to me, aren't even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments. but as one who has not read the books, i end up now looking upon the two versions, live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story, not even complete faithfulness to the books. and with bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what jackson really had (probably final cut). robbed of return of the king's big climactic rush of the story, and with the other two parts becoming rushed, i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations, though as such those same limitations make it disappointing.what's interesting too, after seeing the jackson films first- which i also slightly regret being that i might've reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact, and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out (john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf). the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. but there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. this is not a garden variety disney adaptation- warts and all, this is a bakshi film, with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth.and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its hit or miss appeal. along with being not totally complete as a film, or as stories, the form of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro, but at the time of course was something that was a rough, crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? in some parts, yeah; it does become a little noticeable, as was also the case in bakshi's american pop, that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky, like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. still, there's much i admired in what was done. the orcs, for example, i found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. they're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action, especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section, as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping), and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. it's creepy in a good way. and the backgrounds, while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy, are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. it's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts.so, how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings? i don't know, to tell the truth. it's certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i've seen, the hobbit (and i've yet to see the animated rotk), and there is some real artistry going on. there's also some stilted dialog, an all-too-rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films. if you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, i would say it's worth a chance, even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with lynch's dune it's bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't. i don't.

as an animated film from 1978, this is pretty good--generally well above the standard of the days when disney hadn't done anything good in years (and tolkien cared little for disney anyway). it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work, applying cinematic techniques with relative success. the much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well, especially with the ringwraiths, and the opening narration. however, it is so drastically overused--possibly as a money-saving technique--that it detracts from the overall effect. the same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the prancing pony.as for the adaptation of the story, it's actually quite good. we lose little bits here and there, minor details such as the old forest and tom bombadil, the gaffer and the sackville-bagginses. we compress a few characters, such as revising legolas as one of elrond's household and an old friend of aragorn's, but that's a rather wise decision for film. in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the elves and middle-earth's vast history. in film, you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way. nothing critical is truly lost here, and although i have minor quibbles about some of the changes, i'm generally pretty happy with it.if only the dratted writers had managed to remember saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as aruman, a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named sauron; it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadn't misheard it. it's also annoying that boromir is a bloody stage viking, and irritable from the start. however, gandalf is excellent, and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent. if only john hurt weren't too old to play aragorn; i love his voice.of course, with the film ending at the midpoint of the story, there's a vast disappointment built in. what makes it far, far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the rankin & bass crew on the sequel. that they were permitted to do return of the king after butchering the hobbit remains a huge mystery; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling. for all its faults, this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task. i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision...

more than twenty years before peter jackson's visionary adaptation of the lord of the rings, there was this 1978 animated effort from director ralph bakshi. an ambitious and reasonably faithful version of the story, this has sadly been rather over-shadowed by the jackson trilogy. indeed, many reviewers here on the imdb (mainly those who saw the newer version first) seem to be fiercely unkind to this version.... but if one applies a little common sense, and takes into consideration the time when it was made and the technical possibilities that existed at that time, then they will realise that this is a pretty good film. indeed, it was shortly after seeing this animated movie back in the early '80s that i sought out tolkien's book and immediately became a lifelong fan of these richly detailed middle earth adventures. so, in some respects, i owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film which shaped my literary tastes forever.sauron, the dark lord of middle earth, forges an all-powerful ring that gives him incredible power. following a great battle during which sauron is defeated, the ring falls into possession of a king named isildur. but instead of destroying it he foolishly chooses to keep it. for centuries the ring passes from hand to hand, eventually coming into the possession of a hobbit named frodo baggins who lives in a peace-loving community known as the shire. frodo learns from a wizard named gandalf that his ring is in fact the one ring, the very same that was forged by sauron all those centuries ago, and that its master is once again searching for it in order to restore his dark power over the entire land. frodo embarks on a perilous journey to protect the ring with three other hobbit companions, but every step of the way they are hunted by sauron's ring-wraiths, the black riders. there follow many adventures, during which a company of nine adventurers is formed to guide the ring to the only place where it can be "unmade"  mount doom, in the land of mordor. the film concludes with frodo and his best friend sam on the borders of mordor, closing ever nearer to their horrifying destination. meanwhile gandalf and the other members of the company fight off a huge army of orcs at the legendary fortress of helm's deep.this version covers just over half of the original book. a second instalment was planned to bring the story to an end, but was sadly never completed. while the ending feels abrupt, it does at least end at a sensible point in the story. one has to feel a little frustration and regret that no sequel exists in which we might follow these animated heroes to their eventual goal. the animation is passable, with a nice variety of locales and characters presented in interesting detail. the music by leonard rosenman is suitably stirring and fits in appropriately with the epic narrative. the voice-overs are decent, too, especially john hurt as aragorn and peter woodthorpe as gollum. on the other hand, michael scholes - who provides the voice for sam - is rather campy and goofy, which is not well suited to the character. the lord of the rings is a commendable attempt to visualise the staggering book on which it is based.

this is probably the best of all of the star wars movies. the starting point of the movie was almost like episode iv--spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place, where the seriousness of mobster jabba the hutt was getting even more serious. he ordered luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of bantha, who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. luke's jedi powers eventually finish the monster off. adding to the sneaky rescue of han solo, who was frozen alive at the end of episode v, jabba was very angry about this that luke was sentenced to die at the sarlacc pit outside.but all of the star wars "good guys", especially r2-d2, had other ideas...and those other ideas fended off luke's execution; in the end, most of jabba's soldiers died and princess leia was able to use the force to fatally choke jabba to death.like in episode iv, the death star in episode vi makes its appearance. as i analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the imperial fighters around the death star, the star destroyer personnel, i guessed, sped up the arming of the main laser, using the imperial fighters as a diversion. the 20-25 star destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the death star was fired in surprise. once it fired, the rebel fleet's only hope was that the death star's deflector shield was going to be knocked out, and this affected lando so much because he wanted to destroy the death star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out. and it was taken out with lando's increasing impatience.like in episode v, the imperial walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons, killing at least one of the ewoks...but the ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them. for instance, chewbacca, as well as another ewok, was able to commandeer one of the walkers (and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers), and the other ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers.it is amazing what luke could do with his jedi powers on his light sabre, like, for instance, the scene on endor where luke deflects incoming laser shots from a storm trooper speeder bike, and using the sabre to knock out part of the bike. or, in a climax, using the sabre to break off his own father's arm during the final sabre fight with sith vader.you probably know the ewoks celebration after the death star was blown, complete with a short display of fireworks, drumming on the spoils of victory (e.g., storm trooper masks), and luke finally meeting up with leia after luke's own nemesis---darth vader, now dead, is burned on a pyre. the celebration include ewoks singing but i think lucas did not buy that--even with the strong respect of film composer john williams.on the home movie version, i think lucas himself wanted a different ending. in addition to the celebration on endor, he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets, including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the sith. the ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece. he probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the death star's destruction, balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies.

this film, in my opinion, is, despite it's flaws (which i maintain are *few*), an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art.what mr. bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. he does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. if it were not for mr. bakshi, i don't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught. what is more, with the lord of the rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation). but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm. no, this is not disney animation. no it's not live action. no, it's not "cheating" - what it is is a new, fascinating, and absolutely wonderful art form. something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as "the lord of the rings". bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker of tolkien's creatures, particularly the nazgul, are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.peter s. beagle's screenplay (based very little, as i understand it, on an early draft by chris conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien's works. where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created. there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline. there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled: the reforging of narsil, the gifts of galadriel, the huorns at the battle of the hornburg, but, again, with the time limitations he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).also there is the delightful (one of my favorites) score by leonard rosenman (who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv (the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work)). it is bombastic and audacious and, dare i say, perfect. it stands on it's own as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.the voice actors are wonderful. of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider.the character design is also wonderfully unique, though not often to everyone's taste. but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb. this is perhaps not what you imagined, but i can only applaud mr. bakshi for showing us what he "saw". it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid. bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment, and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build. bakshi's artistic ability and tolkien's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.the recent dvd release (2001) by warner brothers, is sorely lacking. while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is woefully short of extras. how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary, been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release. another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over. also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film. this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.of course, the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of gondor, of shelob, of faramir, of the cracks of doom, of eowyn's battle with the witch king or gandalf's confrontation with him. we will never be graced with bakshi's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead. it is a shame beyond all shames that we will, in the end, have to accept peter jackson's glitz and glitter hollywood, action film version of these later events in tolkien's masterpiece, but, i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.david

when i think of return of the jedi i think epic. yeah ewoks were in there so what? they're an interesting add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies. emperor palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie. palpatine is so evil and vicious, vader looks like mr. rogers compared to him . speaking of darth vader, what an amazing end to such an iconic character. vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out. his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you. the best part was of course the special effects. it's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. the scenes at jabba's palace (leia looks amazing in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. in all jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.

i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia, the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister darth vadar. in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time.when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. vadar it seemed had won the day. how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul.old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself ( played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud.how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar.all in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold. his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good. lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks ( who i really do not believe take from the movie at all. in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star) and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers. we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all. and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back.but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar. for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings. vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke. never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke. there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible. he is conflicted. the apprentice as much as the master. the victim as much as the villain. without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.so in conclusion what can i say. george lucas is the master of the saga. star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it. return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves. it's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of.

after ''empire strikes back'' ''return of the jedi'' is my second favorite movie from the star wars series.luke went to tattoine to save han solo from jabba. at the same time, the galactic empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous death star. if this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the rebel alliance. both vader and the emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new death star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.r2 and c3po are inside jabba's palace to send a message from luke to jabba,where lukes pretends to negotiate han's life. he gives r2 and c3po as a gift to jabba as part of his plan. jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using han solo as a piece of his palace's decoration.(han still is frozen in carbonite) lando is hidden as jabba's guard and chewbacca is also gave to jabba by a reward hunter. when the same hunter tries to save han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess leia in a disguise. the problem is that jabba discovers leia's plan and takes her as his slave,while han is thrown away in chewbacca's cell.luke comes as a jedi knight to rescue his friends. at his first try to kill jabba,he falls into jabba's monster cell (bantha),but easily kills it. jabba stays angry and decides to thrown han,chewbacca and luke to sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it's 'food'. luke,han and chewie has success in scape again, and even boba fett dies when han accidentally throws him in to sarlacc's mouth. leia kills jabba and goes after han,luke and chewie as well c3po and r2. everybody's safe again,luke decides to go to dagoba to complete his training as a jedi,as well his promise to yoda. the problem is that yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, yoda says to luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a jedi, he must fight with vader again. he confirms to luke that vader is luke's dad, and that there is another skywalker besides luke. in his last moments, yoda asks to luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to luke transmit his jedi knowledge to other people. when yoda dies,obi wan's spirit shows up to luke and tells him that luke's father killed his good side anakin to become darth vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. obi wan tells luke that his twin sister is leia, and says the reasons why luke and leia were separated since babies. he gives his last advice to luke saying that if he refuses to kill vader, the emperor will win the war.at the same time, the emperor says to vader that he must give luke to him when he shows up, since luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring luke to the dark side.now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the rebel alliance plans to attack the new space station, the '' death star 2'', luke will confront vader and the emperor, and leia, han and chewie needs to turn off the 'death star 2' power field, with the help of the ewoks. (little creatures who looks little bears)this is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!

thanks to kevin smith, a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi isn't any good because it's actually fun to watch. and oh no! muppets are involved! that makes it bad! everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it. now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it. this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it. this movie is good fun! it's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six! enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith's opinions! his aren't correct!and that ewok song at the end ruled! i bet you people don't even enjoy "ewoks: battle for endor"!!!! i'm going to set you all on fire!

this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. however it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. it's still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.one problem here is the look of the film, which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz. the first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. in "jedi" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. this makes for a much less textured film. also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.another aspect is its lack of originality. where "star wars" created a whole new experience in cinema and "empire" brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, "jedi" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. first we are back on the desert planet tatooine, and then we are watching them face another death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think lucas or kasdan could). also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of "star wars" if they hadn't run out of cash. it just feels like lazy construction.the most unfortunate aspect of "jedi" for me is the weak handling of the han solo character. whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of "empire" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. this is more like a 1990s ford performance, bored and looking "above" the film itself. fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. lando, an interesting character introduced in "empire", here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. only hamill, given an interesting development in the luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor. the film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).visually and in terms of effects work, other than the "clean" look of everything it's hard to find fault. jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. the space battles towards the end are very impressive.ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. but on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas' later productions.

first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427. what i know is this: star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. star wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.how, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. episode vi does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's darth vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin, not just luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.star wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.

i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies. i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted. to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie.it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. i have heard many strange reasons such as: a) because yoda died b) because bobba fett died c) because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely. first off, who cares if bobba fett died??? if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. don't get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be. his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett's name!!! judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think... secondly, many fans did not like yoda dying. sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. all the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon. another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda's death.. well, nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope. (many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy) why was obi wan's death okay but yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. that is utterly ridiculous!! i can not believe this one!! first off, the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) they had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. the only thing they had was their blasters. to add, it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo, chewbacca, and the princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! and not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters. the troopers must have very, very bad aim then! at least in empire strikes back, the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. don't believe me? check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando's base. or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star.the last reason that i care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like darth vader being revealed! well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father, annakin skywalker. it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. by annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was annakin skywalker (by removing the helmet). the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. in fact, that's is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke's father...isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?on another note, i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves. i never go into a film with that deception in mind, i always try to go into a film with the attitude that "well, it might be better or worse that the original .. but i can not know for sure.. let's see." that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.i am not sure who criticizes these movies but, i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite) that it is rotj. i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.bottom line, the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy. this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. for example, the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day!!!finally, i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as "just another sequel") to trash the movie such as "this movie stinks because luke is not in it!" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately.

return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga. with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.the opening sequence, set on tatooine, we see jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to han solo, as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with luke's jedi powers, they have the edge.we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. han, leia and chewy battle it out on endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star. the rebel fleet led by lando, battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and luke has a final showdown with darth vader. an epic end to a classic saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.10/10

i love the satan pit!!! david tennant is such a great actor and so is billie piper!!! who else loves will thorp to pieces??? he is so cute, isn't he? i hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to "go to hell", as rose so bluntly put it. mind you, he was quite funny when he said, "rose, do us a favour, will you? shut up!". mr jefferson was so brave, wasn't he? dying to save the others. i felt really sorry for toby (will thorp) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared. i was like "oh my god if i was rose i'd be so scared for him". and when she hugged him i was like "grrrrrr, he's mine! hands off!" but i thought that was really sweet. and the doctor....well, i thought he was gonna say to ida "tell rose i love her" but he didn't. oh well.

anyone find it interesting that the ood look strangely similar to the 'great cthulhu' of h p lovecraft vintage? hmmm? great pair of episodes (not referring to billie piper as most seem to do!) in the impossible planet and the satan pit.also the link to 'legion' i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist era...great suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements. the new team for these 'who's are working great magic for tv.this certainly creates new fears and 'hide behind the sofa' feelings not seen for many, many years in this continuation of a superb bbc series (pity it is confirmed by the bbc that billie piper is quitting - perhaps not permanently - after end of series 2) :o(((

i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter, the impossible planet, and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past 2 who series. but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one. anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood, whom have become the devil's pawn. there is also a bit of philosophizing on the doctor's part in the episode that i quite enjoyed. needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story. might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers though.my grade: b+

this was an excellent 2-part episode, although i had never been seen the older ones, i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible.being that it's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if its also going to entertain american audiences. but who care about what yanks say, we rock! doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. i hope many old fans will one day soon say "the old doctor who has returned".10 out of 10

despite the feelings of most "star wars" fans, in my opinion "return of the jedi" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. ever since the first time i saw it, it's depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. the film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, george lucas gives us a rousing finish of the "star wars" saga in "jedi".film summary (contains spoilers for those who have not seen it)after "the empire strikes back" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in "return of the jedi". darth vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted death star to oversee it's construction. the emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the rebel alliance and bring young luke skywalker to the dark side. luke, lando, leia, chewie, and the droids all travel to tatooine to rescue the frozen han solo from the crime lord; jabba the hutt. after han has been rescued, and jabba defeated, luke returns to dagobah to find a dying yoda where he learns the awful truth; darth vader is in fact his father. the rebel heroes regroup with the rebel fleet. now joined by other species and races including the mon calamari the rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the death star before it is completed. while lando heads the space attack in the millennium falcon, the rebel heroes must disable the death star's shield generator on the forest moon of endor. it is here that the rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty ewoks. during the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as luke willingly delivers himself to vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the dark side. in emotionally charged sequences luke must face his father as the emperor lures out his dark emotions. as young skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of palpatine, vader turns on his wicked master to save his son's life. filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, "return of the jedi" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.

this is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who. this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question. riddled with spine-chilling moments, this is an episode no "who" fan can afford to miss.starting from when the pit was opened after the events in "the impossible planet", the doctor and ida are trapped and are running out of air. with no other alternatives, they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit, an event which surpasses even the doctor's expectations. whilst there, the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice...meanwhile, rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to fend off the ood, whose minds have been poisoned by the beast. also, is toby zed truly cured of his possession by the beast?

the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the 'new' doctor who's second season. having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit (1967) to an outer space setting, with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast 666. these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor, whilst also highlighting rose's increasing self-confidence, establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord. also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay, which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor, and the performances of the entire cast, most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane.

this two-parter was excellent - the best since the series returned. sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films, but what tv shows don't do that these days. what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story. a great big (really scary) monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, some superb aliens in the ood - the best "new" aliens the revived series has come up with, a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters (complete with a couple of unnamed "expendable" security people in true star trek fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.), and some top-drawer special effects.i loved every minute of this.

this final entry in george lucas's star wars movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. however, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. on the contrary. sure, it's not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but return of the jedi still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.the first third of the movie, where luke and his friends rescue han from the palace of jabba the hutt, is a classic. jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. it must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of jabba's court, including the intimidating, slavering rancor and scary sarlaac pit monster. it builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.things get a little bit slower around the second act, where luke discovers that he and leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart ewoks. most of the complaints about return of the jedi that i've read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. i don't totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. however, their leader, wicket (played by warrick davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the imperial troops' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.by the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the ewoks battle against the troops, lando and the rebel forces launching an attack against the empire's all-new half-completed death star, and luke's final showdown with darth vader and the emperor. the latter ties with the jabba palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. mark hamill flexes his acting chops once again as luke skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance. also, as iconic as james earl jones' voice as darth vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by ian mcdiarmid. the tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.the star wars movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in return of the jedi can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. the space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. of course, given that this movie was made after a new hope and the empire strikes back, it probably shouldn't be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. the acting is classic star wars fare; hamill, harrison ford and carrie fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and anthony daniels provides more hilarious moments as c-3po. frank oz's yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. and yes, there's also john williams' music.all told, while return of the jedi falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.in 1997, george lucas re-released the classic star wars in digitally restored (and revamped) "special editions", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. of the three, return of the jedi appears to have caused the most commotion with star wars fans. perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you're not so easily offended) "jedi rocks" musical number in jabba's palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. however, i did like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. this dvd version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on naboo, where we hear what sounds like jar jar binks screaming, "wesa free!"), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, hayden christensen as the specter of anakin skywalker in the closing scenes. probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in episode ii: attack of the clones it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. however, if you're watching the star wars saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it's probably best to be warned beforehand.as nice as it would be to have lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the "definitive" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the star wars movies altogether as one complete saga (as lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. the original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.

after "star wars: a new hope" redefined science fiction, and "the empire strikes back" redefined "star wars", it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. the first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war. there is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the emperor. when the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. this climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. this is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including han solo, chewbacca, and leia), the battle raging on in space (including lando), and a confrontation between luke and the emperor on the new death star, which leads up to another duel with darth vader. it is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. although i think the idea of ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. there is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of "the empire strikes back", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. with the light tone of "a new hope" and the more sinnister tone of "the empire strikes back", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. the special edition for "return of the jedi" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing tie fighter, but other than that it was good. the gaping non-threatening sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. also, the disco was taken out of jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved. it's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. a third must-see for film fans.

the last film in lucas' saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but i think it is a notch above episode iv (and just a notch below episodes iii and v). in fact, i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. as far as i'm concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. it is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to lucas' universe. there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. also, it is a lot of fun. new characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. c3po and r2d2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and luke is still a great character to identify with. again, it is luke's (and vader's) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. lucas' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. i'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii, viii and ix, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.

up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. the varied action scenes and really different characters (jabba the hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.none of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader.another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford. finally, everyone was on the same page! it was nice to see.in the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.

when it comes to creating a universe george lucas is the undisputed master and his final star wars film is very, very good (and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga). having recently seen revenge of the sith really puts this movie in perspective. the final battle seems even more climactic knowing what anakin skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the emperor. it also makes the final battle between luke and vader more bitter considering the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her children. actually while the new films (especially episode ii) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only. they make the old films seem even better.mark hamill does an exceptional job in this movie. he really brings the changes luke has gone through seem real. in all fairness i believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. harrison ford is still good. however, you can feel that he has done raiders and blade runner in between the two final chapters of star wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit. he adds more comedy (obviously inspired from raiders) to the character which works brilliantly. in short han solo is better than ever. carrie fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. ian mcdiarmid appears in this film and having seen episode iii i can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever. james earl jones still provides the voice for vader and he is still very, very good.in terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the star wars universe looks better than in either of the previous (two) movies but this was always lucas' forté so that is really to be expected. the final battle over endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise. it was also a nice touch that lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax. the only thing i feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the ewoks. these little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in. besides i find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of storm troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery.all in all return of the jedi is a very good movie but the fact that richard marquand is a less accomplished director than irvin kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant. also george lucas' stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance.8/10

a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....there was a boy who was only two years old when the original "star wars" film was released. he doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. he does remember the first "star wars" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. but years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, anakin skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a northern illinois university thing).i can't review "star wars" as a movie. it represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. there's no separating it in my mind from christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. in the winter, my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth (i was always han solo). my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the ewok village. they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home. i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to "star wars" and i think people either just understand that or they don't. i don't get the appeal of "lord of the rings" or "star trek" but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films.i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. every time i put them in the dvd player, i feel like i'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker.grade (for the entire trilogy): a+

i'm sick of people whining about ewoks! true, they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars, but they did happen, so deal with it! besides, they are cute, and i don't care if they're marketable. yubb nubb!this movie always leaves me in tears. it's perfect. the end could not be better. i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin. i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. it's very effective. vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. he is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope. they all do so well. they are believable characters. hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. fisher does a fine job being a female role model (i mean, come on! she killed jabba even when so many others had failed!). harrison ford - need i say more?the music is once again brilliant. it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. the best climax is when luke shouts "nooo!" and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle. john williams is nothing short of a genius! what an amazing man!already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i. i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (can i wait???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.bravo!

perspective is a good thing. since the release of "star wars episode i: the phantom menace", claims and counter-claims of just how episode's ii and iii will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the 'original' star wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. what the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: "return of the jedi". often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect "the empire strikes back". indeed the 'cute' element of rotj, namely the ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? only he can answer that question.this cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga. following on from the conclusion of "the empire strikes back", luke skywalker (mark hamill) follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine, his home planet, to rescue han solo (harrison ford), the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts.skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben 'obi wan' kenobi (alec guiness) to fight the evil empire. now swathed all in black, luke's discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor's side.early scenes in tatooine are impressive, from jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the 'almighty sarlac' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. lucas' cgi enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete.when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by yoda's distinct lack of screentime. undoubtably the star of "the empire strikes back", yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke's destiny is played out on screen.rotj really is luke's film, perhaps even more so than the original. his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate. the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. the romance between leia (carrie fisher) and solo is all but non-existant, unlike in "empire". in fact only leia's character is developed in rotj, solo's character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion. this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all, while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) darth vader. the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than governor tarkin (peter cushing) from "star wars", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid, the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. hamill surprises as the more wisened luke, making his character's progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. ford's role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the real star of the first film after all. fisher's leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi, yoda and the loveable chewbacca, c-3po and r2d2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.despite the film's corny forest battle involving the ewoks and the empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on endor, in space and on the death star, each with very impressive special effects. the music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. just as the 'blue danube' worked perfectly for "2001: a space odyssey", john williams' score is as much a part of "star wars" folklore as light sabers and the force.lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of episodes vii, viii and ix in their heads over and over again. rotj works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.when all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. is it already? the addition of episode i changed the landscape of the series. this is why "return of the jedi" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.

i noticed that a new hope and the empire strikes back are in the top 10, but that this one isn't even in the top 100.this movie has a bad reputation because of ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:-the rescue of han solo from jabba: this official wraps up the han solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in a new hope.-the emperor was finally revealled: well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw the emperor as kids.-the speeder bike chase: alright, so this was a special effects moment. but it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-the 3 part climax: 1) the battle of endor (led by han and leia) 2) luke confronts his father & the fall of the emperor 3) the destruction of the second death star (lando's moment)-the final celebration with our heroes: like i said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the ewoks but i think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the empire, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.all in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the star wars story.

zatoichi the outlaw was the first film made by its hero's (shintaro katsu) own production company, this is perhaps why this is a slightly lesser entry in the series, though it is by no means weak overall. it tells of our hero coming across two towns, rival bosses and a mysterious ronin helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy, violence and no little interest, all served up with lashings of the unshowy but inspired swordplay that is one of the series trademarks. it is a fairly predictable plot and it mounts in unsurprising fashion, but it zips along with style and is interesting stuff. the helpful ronin for example is a nobly inscrutable revolutionary character, upsetting the established order without being painted as a truly likable or heroic figure, zatoichi himself makes one or two mistakes and causes harm by his actions, whilst the ruling system fuels the exploitation of the poor. its a harsh world, with one or two more visceral than expected moments in the fighting, though things aren't as rousing as they could be. shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi, mixing wisdom, deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability, while solid work comes also from rentarô mikuni and an effectively baleful kô nishimura (later to appear as katsu's superior "snake" magobei in the hanzo trilogy) as the two main bosses in the film. there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman. the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events, there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost, meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn't as exciting as it could be, emotional impact is lost also. the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto, though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way, without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments. still, i enjoyed this one, it has its flaws and isn't one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment, a good story and decent doses of zatoichi's trademark ingenious and quirky cool. recommended for fans of the series, and a reasonable entry point, classy stuff though not a true great.

this is one of the oddest films of the zatôichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film. interestingly enough, this was the first zatôichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company. now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, katsu is in charge of making the films. this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films. as far as ichi's role, the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual. he's also easy to fool and actually, for a while, does a lot to harm people instead of helping! "zatôichi rôyaburi" begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness. oddly, in this scene, ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler, though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8. this is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year--so you can see what i said about odd pacing. most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. ichi comes to a town where there is a boss (asagoro) who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation. the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man. at the same time, he meets another boss (shushui)--a sort of guru to the poor. shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching--giving up his blade for many months. shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china--non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (for good or for bad). months after leaving this town and thinking all was well, ichi learns that as soon as he left, asagoro showed his true colors--enslaving women, oppressing the poor and being an all-around jerk. in a way, ichi is responsible for this, as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend. now, asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions.when ichi returns, he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly. this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where, what else, ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui. this finale was very good and occurred in the rain. then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great, though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards.pluses for the film are that although poorly paced, it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 (which often seem very similar). additionally, it does end very well. minuses (aside from pacing) are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat...very, very, very flat. they are tacky and unfunny...that's the sort of flat that it is.

if this had been done earlier in the zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. it is good enough, as most of them are, but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. the situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions, a benevolent boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters, who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites. (he also resembles dracula, as the villains in the later zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do.) these characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against zatoichi as he was drawn originally, but by now he has lost many of his nuances, and the changes in some of the characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man zatoichi has killed, need more time then the movie has to give, so that the story seems choppy, as if some scenes were missing. other than that, the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, the creation of a vivid, believable, and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it), and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist. and of course there is the keynote actor, whose presence, as much as his performance, makes it all work. this must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history.

how i got into it: when i started watching this series on cartoon network,i have to say that i've never seen anything like this,and it was the best. but when i started collecting the series on vhs,and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections. it was amazing,and truly worth watching. it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. and of course,the theme songs "just communication",and rhythm emotions" were the best.characters,and gundams: my favorite characters in the show were:heero,duo,relena,treize,lady und,noin,and zechs. my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero,and epyon,and of course the altron,and deathscythe i,and ii.meaning of the show: what this series also tells us that in real life,wars are very hard and we can sometimes win,or lose. but peace can also be hard to obtain,and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing,and are trying to obtain world peace.but however,this show is truly the best of the best. so in closing to this review,after you watch this show,see the movie endless waltz.

over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check! weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - check! mobile suits based on angels - check!ok - its a gundam series. this one, gundam wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy.with characters, the initially weak relena dorlan (later peacecraft, then back to dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy, the series main character). the aforementioned heero, initially a cold, hard butcherer, becomes more and more human, while still remaining in-character. and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise) float between oz, freelance, and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. however, in 49 half-hour episodes, it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential.the ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc - are ones that resonate even today. in retrospect, the series was ahead of its time, what with the "war on terrorism" and all. but its exploration of these ideas, the monologues, especially those of treize kushrenada, is an incredible dramatic piece, forming some of the best writing in the series.but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor, which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.in terms of eye-candy, which is what this one has in bucketloads, everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra (no not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed, and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad, because better animation would've had better explosions). but who cares?! stuff explodes, and thats all that matters.in short though, the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes, you've missed out on a lot. the poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animation makes you go "wtf?!?!" but this is made up for in its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations.

i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss.it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub). it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. the relationship between heero and relena, and milliardo and noin are joys to watch. the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off. and then there's the giant robot fighting. fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene. any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.

the second alternate gundam universe tale (g-gundam being the first), gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse. the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts. the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization. in truth, the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict, the eve wars, don't happen until the later episodes. the greatest positives of this series are it's characters. all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in. another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. the designs put some of it's other gundam counterparts to shame. one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga. why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me. true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.take for example, the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable. throughout the series, zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well, while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon. another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes: "killer of his own men." char isn't given this label. the problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems. the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks. sure it's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks, ms, and planes the first time. but on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old. the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year. if you really think about all the events springing in the series, a lot happens in just one lone year. but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often. as it ranks, this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world. after all, this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television.

while being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series, upon re-watching the series, i have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the gundam design, character design, and character depth are masterfully executed. while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts, the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art, with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters. consequently, it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character. personally, i liked heero because of his stoic personality. while i may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood, i can objectively say that gundam wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general (how can we obtain peace?) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits, which, to say the least, is excellent.

i've watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story. the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted. gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams. the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz. as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate. old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting. but, how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal. i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot.

gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime. a bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but over all enjoyable. now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a "winger", i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam, gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th ms team, and gundam seed.i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be "rip-offs" (i.e. zechs marquise to the original gundam's char), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series, as is seed.if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first, and then know that you are watching an au series.

gundam wing is an amazing show from start to finish, every single episode is a joy to watch. the story is typical gundam fare, in the future earth's populations grows to the extent where we create space colonies in order to expand. the story though is set in an entirely different reality than any other gundam show. it is the year after colony 195 and the corrupt earth government, known as the earth sphere alliance, is violently taking over the free colonies. to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat that is to come (an evil militaristic organization hiding within the alliance known as oz, which later takes control of earth and the colonies), select members of the colonies send 5 super powerful mechs to earth to try and save the colonies from the threat that is to soon come. these mechs, known as gundams, fight oz and try to regain peace in the colonies as oz takes the front-stage, completely eliminating the alliance and taking control of earth and its colonies.gundam wing as i previously stated, is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion. a large part of this reason is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before it, but also the stories are far more deep and intricate than majority of the other gundam series. gundam wing has more depth and emotion to it than any other gundam show i have ever seen thus far. this particular series seemed to focus more on character and the relationships amongst those characters than epic space battle. now don't get me wrong, this show still has many epic battles within it, and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere that other gundam series have, but it achieves this by having the story follow an ensemble cast of 6 or 7 characters as opposed to following just 1.no matter how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there, and i strongly recommend it to any fan of anime, or sci-fi in general. the show sports some amazing animation and superb action, but the depth and intricacy of the story is what keeps you coming back for more. the characters are so well drawn out by the end of the show that you end up loving each and every one of them. this show is definitely one that shouldn't be missed.a perfect 10/10!

i'm not a big fan of most anime, but gundam wing is truly something else. gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, gundam wing gets right down to business. gundam wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles. though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. to my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally dubbed by them too. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only does every word said match up, but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable. many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in english, but i simply don't have the determination to do that. not only are the voices good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. i'll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. the plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some prime time drama like lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series. the rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. thus a war is started, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. i feel that any more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. i'll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime, anyone that thinks all anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.

gundam wing is a fun show. i appreciate it for getting me into gundam and anime in general. however, after watching its predecessors, such as mobile suit gundam, zeta gundam, and even g gundam, i find wing to be gundam lite.characters: an aspect long held by gundam is to have their characters thrust into difficulties and grow into maturity. this does not happen in wing. heero is top dog at the beginning, and he's top dog at the end. personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. the best character is zechs, who is for all intents and purposes a hero throughout most of the series. but suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason.mecha: wing has great suit designs. the gundams are super cool, with the epyon being my favorite. i even consider a few of the oz suit designs to be on par with some of the classic zeon suits. but sweet suit designs doesn't quite save the series from boring characters.conclusion: in the end, wing has cool fight scenes, though riddled with recycled animation, but shallow plot and character development. enjoyable, but not moving like previous gundam outings.

since the title is in english and imdb lists this show's primary language as english, i shall concentrate on reviewing the english version of gundam wing(2000) as presented in the bandai released dvd set. my actual review for the whole series is under imdb's entry of ""shin kidô senki gundam w"(1995).very little is changed in respect to plot, script and characterization its adaptation to english and it really depends on your own taste to choose which language to watch this show in. purists can stick to japanese all they want, but for a more "realistic" experience i recommend the english track since all the characters, except heero yuy, are not japanese.(most of them are caucasian in fact with a couple of non-japanese asians.) for one thing, the characters' personalities come across more "directly" than in the japanese version. the contrast between the characters is stronger thanks to some give-or-take performances but a very well cast group of actors.wing gundam's pilot heero yuy is a highly trained soldier who suppresses his emotions but slowly learns the value of his humanity. voiced by mark hildreth who's deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but it matches heero's personality very well.deathscythe gundam's duo maxwell, ever cheerful in the face of death is given a crash course in the cherishing the value of life and friends. he is possibly the best acted character in the whole show, masterfully played by scott mcneil. he may sound a little too old for his age, but duo's english voice easily out ranks his irritatingly nasal japanese one.trowa, the pilot of heavyarms, is a lost lonely soul who's only purpose so far has been combat; despite his inner desire to form connections with the people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to befriend. kirby morrow gives a somber but realistic performance as trowa barton.quatre rebarba winner is voiced by brad swaile who has no trouble brining out the caring nature of the character and the shattering of his innocence as he experiences horrors of war and death first hand. a huge plus point is that quatre no longer sounds like a girl(and yes he is voiced by a female actress in the japanese version) but a bona fide typical 15 year old guy.the impulsive but determined wufei chang voiced by ted cole may seem a little over-the-top but it plays out in stark contrast to the more subdued roles of heero and trowa.relena darlian sounds older in english, voiced by lisa ann bailey. this might not sit well with her youthful personification early in the series but as her character matures later into the story, her voice follows suit and ends up fitting in very well with the character development.zechs merquise would be one of the more drastically changed voices when compared to the japanese version. both voices bring out different sides to the same character. his japanese voice is haughty, authoritative and commands respect , keeping in line with his high ranking status and charismatic nature. his english voice by brian drummond is more subdued, sounding more devious and "snake-like", highlighting zechs' secretive nature regarding his hidden agendas and staunch beliefs in his ideals.the members of oz are a mixed bag really. treize kushrenada voiced by david kaye is given a more realistic and down-to-earth performance compared to his larger-than-life japanese style of speaking. however, lady une does not convey her split personality as contrastingly as in the japanese version and lucrencia noin just sounds.........bored most of the time. the cannon fodder pilots and military leaders are nothing to speak of either.i would have appreciated if they took the time to give different characters different accents to reflect their ethnic backgrounds. the maganac corp's voices were generally uninspired but could have been more interesting if they were given middle eastern accents. the members of the romerfeller foundation would have also sounded better with some classy european accent that reflects their status of nobility.despite underwhelming acting from the side characters, the main cast manage to carry the show and it results in an overall less over-the-top and more realistic rendition of gundam wing's script. very faithful to the original japanese script, keeping all the underlying thought provoking ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. sadly, it also retains the flaws of the original japanese script.

i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes, i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow, yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling. i am still a fan.....with some minor pains.though this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everything(sound familiar?), i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plans(especially the character called wufei...i mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera. get a counselor,will ya?)besides for the over-exaggerated drama(i think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors), this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again. i mean it can always be worse. it could be like the recent installment, seed......eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic....i'll chat about that one later.

mobile suit gundam wing is the fourth series in the continuing gundam chronicles. unlike the previous entries which focused on massive wars, this one is a little different; instead of having an army-vs.-army situation, this one is led by five teenage boys (due to their ability to blend in more readily than normal adults) and their machines called "gundams" because of the metal alloy used in their construction. which leads to problems, since gundams are supposed to be destroyed, replaced by "mobile suits", which are piloted less-destructive weapon platforms and "dolls" which are ran on a.i. and are used as grunt infantry.the whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that gives gundam wing an edge over a greater portion of the anime that makes it's way here. especially since most anime is adapted from popular magazines, such as naruto, dragonball, one piece, dragonball z and inuyasha which are all from shonen jump, which is now available in america.mobile suit gundam wing sets itself apart from most anime in the fact that instead of over-the-top battles between mortals who more resemble gods, gundam is very humanistic and seems to revel in the fact that it is dramatic instead of melodramatic and events seem to unfold across the series gracefully. normally in anime there are more than few series that think that the best way to go about having a "small" battle is to have it take a half-hour - something that would never happen in real life. gundam tops this by making sure that everyone knows that characters will die, machines will be destroyed and rebuilt, battles will be lost and won, and it never seems as though it makes the actions themselves satirical.but the magic of gundam wing is in the details, and what this series has that more anime would be grateful for having. emotion. instead of mythic prophecies, magic, or overblown martial arts, gundam wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (note: the author would like to state that neon genesis evangelion is not hard-line-plausible-in-real-life science fiction due to the religious subject matter that is the core of its series) they love star wars, but hate a.i. (the movie). henceforth why gundam wing was and gundam seed is now in production for both japanese and u.s. releases at the same time with two voice teams. american audiences only have to wait two or three weeks after the end of the japanese season to catch the dubbed or subtitled versions or even the edited seed episodes that air on cartoon network.the emotion is that these two sides that are fighting a war are technically backwards. the heroes are those who defend the rights of the more wealthy and aristocratic citizens of earth from the band of terrorists bent on victory at any and all costs that make up the protagonists of mobile suit gundam wing. this is not war, this is "total war". every person, every building, every street is a target for attack, both on earth and off.my only complaint, and the reason it didn't get the score of ten, is that at about three-fourths of the way through, it just kind of goes dead for a few episodes, and no one really seems to change. kind of like a present-time flashback, which is fine due to what it reveals about the characters, but at the same time it drags down what should be the brewing between project: meteor and oz. but the final two episodes and the overplayed-on-cartoon-network (back in 2001-2003) mobile suit gundam wing: endless waltz movie more than make up for the slack.

dear readers,with high expectations, human beings leave earth to begin a new life in space colonies. however, the allied forces of the united earth sphere alliance gain great military control over the colonies and soon seize one colony after another in the name of justice and peace...the year is after colony 195. operation meteor. in a move to counter the alliance's tyranny, rebel forces from several colonies send new arsenals to earth disguised as shooting stars...however...the alliance forces catch on...gundam wing is the most popular and most successful of the entire gundam series. with cutting-edge anime animation, stunning action, amazing mobile suits, breathtaking scripts, and some of the most unforgettable characters in anime history.i'll try to explain the plot of gundam wing as best as possible. earth has now colonized space, but the uesa forces have forcibly occupied them along with the help of the mysterious elite force oz and their shadowy leaders, treize kushrenada and the romefeller foundation. five pilots are sent to earth piloting mobile suits with extraordinary power known as the gundams. pursued by the mysterious lieutenant zechs merquise, treize's second-in-command, a young teenager named relena, and the alliance military, the gundam pilots unleash hell upon earth for the freedom of the colonies while all the while, a plot most sinister architected by treize begins to start.signed, the constant dvd collector

i totally disagree.i thought that this was a great movie for kids.dawn wells from gilligans island,and promise shown of a barely then known dana plato.it was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless fluff.no it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to be.i wont ruin the ending.but it was unusual the way that it was done.i mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the end.the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially initially.it also helps them out of a jam towards the end.it also has the plus of not being overly long.i think it clocks in at under 95 minutes

this charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful "the legend of boggy creek" is a follow-up in name only. stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious bigfoot creature called "big bay ty" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of boggy creek. two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future "different strokes" sitcom star dana plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. the trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.tom moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. the adorable dawn wells (mary ann on "gilligan's island") gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while jim wilson and john hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. robert bethard's capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. darrell deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. in addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance.

i saw this movie when i was 13 and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond . i don't think it's garbage .it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either . its just a cute kids movie about 3 children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster . the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature .haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat . this is a good movie for kids ,no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids.

this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to boggy creek as if it's a sequel.this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare. dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid. yes it's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8-12 y/o group which it targeted. it's harmless g-rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it. strictly for the 8-12 y/o set ,older kids will get bored and think it lame.

you play as b.j. blazkowicz, a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii. that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler's war machine and even the fuhrer himself.this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. that's because it literally inspired obsession. many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. this is one of them. just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002. yes, doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by b.j. blazkowicz. the space marine, duke nukem, max payne, serious sam, john mullins, jc denton, agent 47, gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id. whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.also: "halt!" *bang! bang! bang!* "aarrrgh!!!" never grows old. --- 8/10voluntarily rated pc-13 for "profound carnage." however, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today.

many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3d game, or even the first shoot-'em-up. it's also one of the first stealth games, one of the only(and definitely the first) truly claustrophobic games, and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general. with graphics that are terribly dated today, the game thrusts you into the role of b.j.(don't even *think* i'm going to attempt spelling his last name!), an american p.o.w. caught in an underground bunker. you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes(but, let's face it, most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon, surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders). the graphics are, as i mentioned before, quite dated and very simple. the least detailed of basically any 3d game released by a professional team of creators. if you can get over that, however(and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you), then you've got one heck of a good shooter/sneaking game. the game play consists of searching for keys, health and ammo, blasting enemies(aforementioned nazis, and a "boss enemy" per chapter) of varying difficulty(which, of course, grows as you move further in the game), unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms. there is a bonus count after each level is beaten... it goes by how fast you were(basically, if you beat the 'par time', which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level; this can be quite fun to try and beat, and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in, they are even challenging after many play-throughs), how much nazi gold(treasure) you collected and how many bad guys you killed. basically, if you got 100% of any of aforementioned, you get a bonus, helping you reach the coveted high score placings. the game (mostly, but not always) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing... stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see. you can either run or walk, and amongst your weapons is also a knife... running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard, as is gunshots. many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you, meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them... nearly silently. in your inventory, you can get no less than four weapons and two keys... more about the weapons later. the keys unlock certain doors. most doors in the game aren't locked... only two kinds need keys, and these keys are only introduced in later levels(you restart in levels, resetting weaponry, health, score and lives in each chapter). much of the later game is spent looking for them. now, as i just alluded to, this game, like many of the period(late 80's, early 90's), is based on collecting extra lives... personally, i think it's completely and utterly useless(it was mercifully dropped from here on end... i think(?), from the next 3d shooter and onwards), since you can save anytime you want and 'using a life' resets weaponry, health and ammo, like starting on a new chapter(which is a real pain in later levels, where you *need* heavier artillery). now, i shall beat around the bush no longer... moving on to the guns! you start with aforementioned knife(which is silent but only effective up close) and a pistol... nothing special, but good for conserving ammo, unlike the next two bad boys. your third weapon is a german smg... a sub-machine-gun. it's faster and automatic, and some later enemies use it. and the last one... is nothing short of a gatling gun! oh yeah! think t2. think predator. think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun. it's every bit as entertaining as it sounds. most of the boss enemies use this, though, so be prepared. i won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies, however... that's for each player to discover for him(or her)self. the sound is excellent... very crisp and realistic. as you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing, the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german, you truly feel like you are there, trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems. that segues me nicely into the level design... as you run through seemingly countless, nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further, you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood. i almost got motion sickness more than once(though that might also have something to do with little sleep, lots of humidity and unusual warmth...) from playing. though the level of detail isn't terribly high, what there is is great. remains of victims, guards' quarters and countless nazi symbols... the list goes on. the game also features quite a bit of gore... for it's limited graphics engine, john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game. what is there left to say... the first of its kind, and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3d shooters. sure, weapon bobbing and different height levels(stairs and such) didn't come around until the next entry into the genre... doom... and it was duke nukem 3d that introduced the feature of switching your view(so it goes beyond simply left and right, adding vertical dimensions to it), and jumping didn't come around until a third, later title(the first quake, possibly? fellow gamers, help me out here)... but all of those games, as well as the rest of the genre, owe their existence to this one. so load up the luger, open the door to enter the bunker and step into b.j.'s shoes... he deserves the recognition, even(or maybe even especially?) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared. i recommended this to all fans of 3d games. 8/10

the kids, aged 7 to 14, got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year. they all loved it! kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently, and we get a kick out of watching it with them.it's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long, and offers laughs for the adults, too. most enjoy it more than the first.top-quality production and an excellent cast, led by christopher showerman as a superior george--athletic, energetic, and wholly credible, with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother-in-law, thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival, and everybody else. this is fun.

in order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be: children's. they had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie (meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st) taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. sequels usually make me nervous, however this one did pretty well for itself. knowing that it didn't have the star power of fraiser as george they capitalized on the humor and i believe showeman did pretty well as the lead. the plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience, if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one.

i loved this movie! chris showerman did an amazing job! not only is he an incredible actor, but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique! he did a great job on the delivery of his lines, plus transformed into george better than fraser did. a great performance for his first major roll! this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out. in addition to the movie, the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious. two thumbs up on this one! i highly recommend it to everyone!

allow me to just get to the bottom line here: i've got 3 kids, ages 5 to 10. i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz, the over-18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone.what makes me support the one child of mine (it varies) who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening? in a word: showerman.moment of silence...*sigh*

lupin sets off for morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. it's a nice different location for lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than lupin. on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. plus, this way, lupin can focus on the ladies...fujiko rules in this. throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin, and us viewers. then there's lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable. this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon, as well as some fun scenes with fujiko. inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.pretty much, this is a smooth ride with lupin. the plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. enjoy.

this movie is more lupin then most, especially coming from funimation. other then the bad dub, it isn't bad.the first hour is a lot like the comic (which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on). lupin's trying to get a huge treasure. fujiko's using lupin's weakness to women to try to get something out of it. the last bit isn't that bad, he's with another women, but of course fujiko's still him number one.a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin. any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised (i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie). it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall, it isn't a bad film. good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies.

if you like animal movies, this movie will please. my wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. it is geared towards kids, but i laughed at most of the humor. the french fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. it is a disney film, with its sappy, happily, family apeal, but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing.

i really like 101 dalmations when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it's more funnier, more humor, and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961) i wonder if there are plans for 103 dalmations. i hope there is, maybe yes, maybe no, all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future.

i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time. don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g. it's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice, particularly the "triangle" between cruella, le pelt, and cruella's faithful valet alonso. glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is "cured" of her fur loving ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater. (i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loving ella.) all in all i will go see it again in theaters, i found myself enjoying it so much.

while this was a better movie than 101 dalmations (live action, not animated version), i think it still fell a little short of what disney could do. it was well-filmed, the music was more suited to the action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). the acting was perhaps better, but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel, and glenn close is really not to be missed, as in the first movie. she makes it shine. her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of, and they add to the spectacle disney has given us. this is a great family film, with little or no objectionable material, and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. it's bound to be a classic, as so many disney films are. here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;)

this is just as good as the original 101 if not better. of course, cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits, and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella. we see a lot more of her this time round. i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin, the rather bumbling male lead. to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. the movie is well worth watching whatever your age, provided you like animals.

i noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on dodie smith's novel. in any case, it was a nice idea that pongo and perdita's son now had his own puppies. the cutest of the dalmatians was, of course, little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film. to be honest, i didn't know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind. in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into "herself" again and announced that she was cruella once more, i almost began to be really worried about chloe's dalmatians.actually, the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner, was much better than i had expected. i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again, but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property. and what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?finally, it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.

arguably this is a very good "sequel", better than the first live action film 101 dalmatians. it has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! cruella devil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. many, including chloe simon, owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. others, like kevin shepherd (owner of 2nd chance dog shelter) believe that she has changed. meanwhile, dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! little dipper, domino and oddball...starring eric idle as waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film. this is also funnier than the last film.enjoy "102 dalmatians"! :-)

the first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing. this sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. but the dogs are very cute here, and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw. the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially cruella's), and the music is pleasant. the acting is mostly very good, ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella's accomplice. but the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as cruella, even more evil than she was previously. overall, nice. 7/10 bethany cox

in 1996's "101 dalmatians," cruella de vil was arrested by the london metropolitain police (god bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians. all covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the "tin can." now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail. i say, that's about 28 years - in dog years!!!!!so, in 2000, disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed "102 dalmatians." in it, there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family (oddball is the name, i think; i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently), and the puppy had no spots!!!!! also, while cruella (again played by glenn close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - made once again out of the puppies!!!!!i especially liked the theme song - i'm sure everybody loves the "atomic dog" song from the 70s or so. and now, we hear a bit of it in this movie!!!!!"102 dalmatians" is such a great film that i keep on wondering - when will there be a "103 dalmatians?????" lol10 stars

enormous fun for both adults and children, this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults.glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella (`call me ella') de ville.after three years in dr. pavlov's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits.but it wouldn't be a dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. and now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round.ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `second chance' dog shelter. though he was in `titanic' and in last year's television version (as pip) of `great expectations' i didn't recognize him; well, he was fifth officer lowe' in `titanic' and i didn't see `great expectations' so i am not terribly surprised.gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of cruella. he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well. his 'wicked witch of the west' homage is hilarious.tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also alonzo,' cruella's butler, in `101 dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `black adder' brit-coms. he plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect.oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination.animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. suffice it to say that `102 dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 dalmatians' that came out in 1996. there is a lot to like here: from the sight gags, the dialogue, and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family.

what if a platoon of g.i.'s from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate? great pitch right? the movie does exactly what it says on the tin.thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the, usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies, scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. no how's or why's. they just did. however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful, if not a bit dated. not as silly as one would imagine.the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t. but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g.i.s arrival to medieval japan, it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. undoubtedly it's the main order of the day. the whole concept and by extension the movie itself, was probably originated from this simple pitch: what if g.i.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? and boy does it deliver.the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action/war movies. not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length, it's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g.i. samurai can deliver. i mean, where else would you get the chance to feature tanks, ninjas complete with shuriikens, a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? the g.i. platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras, gunning them down with machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks.this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki's samurai banners, while the other is in western action and war movies. there are stylistic touches (like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence) that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g. castellari circa keoma to mind. japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa, and g.i. samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film.the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent, it's just that it doesn't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. the budget was probably hefty, as it is evident in the hundreds of extras, elaborate costumes (very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki) and special effects. the camera-work and editing are all top notch, almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.it's not withouts its flaws either of course. there are many "song" scenes, where all sorts of 70's japanese rock, disco and country songs play over montages (there's a bonding scene, a love-interest scene, a "war is hell" scene etc). the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes, it flies like a bullet for the most part. still some scenes, flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.the cast also deserves a mention, featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba, isao natsuyagi (goyokin, samurai wolf), tsunehiko watase (the yakuza papers) and hiroyuki sanada, all of them hitting the right notes.

"gi samurai" sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason, and much carnage ensues. it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs. machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results.the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title; initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal box?" etc etc), "aren't we better off here" discussions and ultimately a huge battle. the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all, the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon; a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance. it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length.chiba gives a gruff performance as iba, initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him. this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv. by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers, as they seem to be asking "weren't we better off back then?'. but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of (almost) non stop action.

pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. what do you do? well, if you're a hollywood studio, you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i. samurai (aka timeslip) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie. but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. and yes, there are decapitations.of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it. impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.

i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood, i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery. but i did really like the concept. if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. that said, having just watched the restored 137 minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it, though not as much as when i was seven ( i remembered the ending ). there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments, my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ). for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing, when seven i though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action, especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of shogun era warriors. the makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and, lets face it, humorous. i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid, and i am not ashamed to say that i still do.i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum, they've got heavy calibre machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal japan theirs. which is what i'd like to think any vigorous imdb user would do in their boots.in short the movies worth watching, it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise, and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like g.i. samurai is so unique.

i just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. i won't bother repeating what others have said. what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. the huge battle is exhausting. afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. blues, country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. it's hideous. you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. i really wish i could erase the music but alas.seek this out. it's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.

if you are a fan, then you will probably enjoy this. if you don't know who misty mundae, darian caine, ruby larocca, or seduction cinema are, this is not the movie to start out with. it's very cute, silly, the girls are hot, and it's fun to watch. there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot's not a total bore. misty mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids, so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others. but her panties in this are quite cute (you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird). if you do like this one, you will probably enjoy "that 70's girl", "vampire vixens", or "erotic survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphic). if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual, more horror/exploitation-based (but lower budget) movies, check out the factory 2000 website.

this movie is full of references. like "mad max ii", "the wild one" and many others. the ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference (or tribute) to peter lorre. this movie is a masterpiece. we´ll talk much more about in the future.

to quote flik, that was my reaction exactly: wow...you're perfect! this is the best movie! i think i can even say it's become my favorite movie ever, even. wow. i tell you what, wow.

this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time! wonderful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) made this one a total winner in my book, and also in the books of those i saw it with. i still want to see it again, but haven't had time. better than toy story, which was good too, but not this good .

i thought this was a quiet good movie. it was fun to watch it. what i liked best where the 'outtakes' at the end of the movie. they were great.

i have to admit right off the top, i'm not a big fan of "family" films these days. most of them, imho, are sentimental crap. but this one, like toy story, the previous film from pixar, is a lot of fun. the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too bland(especially compared to the two leads in antz, but otherwise this film is better), but the rest of the film more than made up for it. the animation looked great, the humor, though broad, was consistently good(i especially liked hopper's line "if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you, i would kill you!"), and the actors doing the voices, except the two leads, were all terrific(denis leary doing an animated movie; what a concept). and like everyone else, i loved the outtakes! i hope the video has the new ones.

this movie blew me away. if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of antz. the plot, characters, and jokes are better in a bugs life. also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits. it's the best part of the movie. rating 9

i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film. if you sit close to the screen, you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures. the detail, colors, and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story. how they were able to pull off the shading, i will never know. i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished. based on this film, i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film.

all of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios' last productions, here comes something that should heal your wounds... once and for all, a bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake "hand-made-old-disneys-like" drawings (see the lion king, pocahontas, and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).a bug's life (1001 pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say "hey, this thing is computer generated !". no weak parts, a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets, an astonishing 3d bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.the scenario, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness ! curiously, and obviously thanks to lasseter's team, there is practically no musical sequence in a bug's life. which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate, but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans, like me). this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase : the 3 amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them, etc...). simple, but efficient, and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.since microcosmos, many movies tell tales of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but i do think that a bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... and the whole audience was captivated by flik's (aka tilt in france) adventures.a big thank you for lasseter's team, especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...and finally, especially for those of you who have seen the french version, other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. a bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment, and i think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies, and that's not a problem of storage room :). go and see it, that's an order.

disney (and the wonderful folks at pixar of course) offer a nice, humourous story combined with the best of computer animation. i admit that maybe the 'faces' of the bugs were a little more static than in 'antz' and they only had four legs (in 'antz' six...). but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking. but let this be a lesson: it was not the computer who made it such a success : it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists, which i missed in 'antz'. some highlights were of course the 'bloopers' at the end (so keep watching at the end, it's worth it!), which were highly amusing and original. the line 'filmed entirely on location' was intended for the more attentive viewer.

for starters, it's a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh (check out the two russian bugs).a bug's life has a classical disney storyline, but that's one of the good things about the movie. family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end. and it also has a couple of great voice-overs by dave foley, julia-louise dreyfus, kevin spacey (of course),... but actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. it's just wonderful. all the details, great colors, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds... and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic. all in all, a very nice piece of work. this is the best animation by disney since aladdin.

the animation was fab and the film funny. the two circus bugs, tuck/roll were very funny. if you waited till the credits at the end, you saw a very funny sequence of film, where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies, that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable.

a must see by all - if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one. easily one of the best animation/cartoons released in a long-time. it took the the movies antz to a whole new level. do not mistake the two as being the same movie - although in principle the movies plot is similiar. just go and enjoy.

i liked antz, but loved "a bug's life". the animation that was put into this paid off. i will definitely be getting this on dvd. by the way, disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape. (i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format). most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest! i only saw one of the two sets, but i can't wat to see the other one!

now this is what a family movie should be! there are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public; but this is one of them. my whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy. we're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. the children loved it and so did we (hubbie and i are 36 and 32, respectively)!apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they may be, and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators. this is a film worthy of walt disney, himself. i think mr. disney would heartily approve of this new film... flick, dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and minnie in our time.this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or dvd. i'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what i might have missed the first time. (never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before... my daughter is still talking about little "dot".)this film is funny, heartwarming, clever and great fun for the whole family!

bugs life is a good film. but to me, it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff. don't get me wrong, i liked this movie, but it wasn't as good as toy story. the film has the visuals, the laughs, and others that toy story had. but the film didn't feel quite as... i don't know, but i thought it was still a pretty good film. a bugs life... i don't want to say this, is a film that i don't remember. i saw it years ago. of course, i haven't seen toy story in years, but i still remember it. i shouldn't have reviewed this film, but i am. i am giving it a thumbs up, though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done.a bug's life:***/****

pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length cgi animated movies they have made. "a bug's life" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far, preceded by the company's feature-length debut, the groundbreaking "toy story", which was the first ever feature-length cgi movie. i remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's, but i never actually saw it until november 2006. i watched it twice that month, and over three years later, i have seen it a third time. it has never impressed me as much as probably any other pixar film i've ever seen, but after three viewings, i still think it's better than some of the films i've seen from dreamworks animation.ant island is the home of a colony of ants. these ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. one member of this colony is flik, an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions, even though he doesn't mean to. one year, when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering, flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! the grasshopper leader, hopper, decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season, but they will have to double their offering! flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds "warrior bugs" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. princess atta, the future queen, lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. the inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors, but after he takes them back to ant island and introduces them, he learns that they are actually not warriors, but circus bugs!the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. to me, none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have, and generally seem a bit bland. fortunately, however, it's not like "shark tale", a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. "a bug's life" does have a likable enough main character, one which viewers can root for. the story also seems somewhat bland at times, but for the most part, it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining, and sometimes has some good suspense, especially later on. the humour, like certain other aspects of the film, isn't as good as it could have been, but there are definitely funny moments, some of them involving francis, a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. you can always expect great animation from pixar, and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. with all this movie has to offer, it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to pixar standards, but it is reasonable family entertainment.

a bug's life is a very good animated feature. this movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. the story is about an ant named flik. he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie. the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. the story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. the voice acting is good as with most animation movies. the music is nice to listen to. nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. this is a good movie for all families. i rate this movie 10/10.

many of the american people would say...what??? to my opening comment. yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is right. we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village. the great difference is the way that the story takes. our samurais, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs, heroes. please watch again this incredible movie (the seven samurai, obviously) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa. a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas, michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller's, but he didn't found the third foot of the cat.

when watching a bug's life for the first time in a long while, i couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's happy feet. as far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. it just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. a lot of people disagree with me when i say that i really like pixar's sophomore effort. sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of toy story, nor is the animation out of this world. however, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. with plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, i could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.there is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. between our lead flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. even the villain hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. he is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. he needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. it is very much a circle of life, but not one that can't evolve with the ages.when thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. compared to antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. the water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. you don't have to look much further than the ants' eyes to see how much detail went into the production. the reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. all the bugs are finely crafted too. the flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. it is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. while ant island is nice, it is just the outdoors. bug city contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. it is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. from the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagoncomplete with full nutrition guide on the sideand crazy compilation of boxes to create a times square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.as far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. no one could do a male ladybug better than dennis leary with his acerbic wit. i dare you to think of someone better. our leads are great too with dave foley as flick and julia louis-dreyfus as princess atta, as well as the always-fantastic kevin spacey as hopper. spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. yes, a bug's life was the originator of animated outtakes from pixar, a tradition that has continued on. with many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. full of "those guy actors," it is people like richard kind, brad garrett, and the late joe ranft as heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. there are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. complete with a couple of my favorite pixar characters, tuck and roll, there isn't too much bad that i can think of saying about it.

lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson's early bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work, something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages, in a way that just makes you feel good. a bug's life has that same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects, because even though they talk, they still act just like real bugs. it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them, to imagine bugs the way a young mind does.honey, i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger, and to me, a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities. i try not to compare it to something like toy story (which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made), because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's, but then again, almost nothing is. the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun. the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society, mostly geared around building a harvest of food, most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers, vastly superior in strength and general meanness, and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter. we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food, the consequences will be dire. and incidentally, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse-tung's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the "great leap forward"the fun and excitement begins when flik, the main character, sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers. you see, he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers. great for the audience, not so great for the safety of the clan. the movie was released back in the late 90s, when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos, like armageddon and deep impact, independence day and the arrival, a bug's life and antz, etc. comparisons between a bug's life and antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film, and not only because it doesn't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role. this is great family fun!

when i bought my toy story tape when it came out to video after being released in theaters i saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of toy story. as soon as i saw that i knew this was gonna be a good feature! i was right! a bug's life like toy story is great story, great characters and great animation. my favorite characters are dim the rhino beetle voiced by brad garrett and hemlich the caterpillar voiced by the late pixar storyman joe ranft. my favorite scene is when slim the walking stick (david hyde pierce) lifts up hemlich trying to distract the bird and hemlich's like you hoo mr. early bird. how about a nice tasting worm on a stick and slim's like i'm going to snap! i'm going to snap! i just died laughing at that scene. being a big fan of insects i think a bug's life is my favorite pixar even though i know a lot of people consider it the worst pixar film ever! i don't know how you could hate a pixar film! i think they're all pretty good films! good job pixar!

the movie was totally awesome and cool. the graphics was superb and it was amazing, especially, flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent. the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie. the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie. hopper was a pure and perfect villain. even, dot was cute. when, the bird comes to eat the bugs, that scene was superb and good. even, the last scene was awesome and cool. even, flik's inventions was good. building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers. when, the ants are building the artificial bird, that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of "a bug's life".

such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar's a bug's life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  a bug's life is a warm reminder. we walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.it is only pixar's second animated feature. the sub-group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie toy story. it was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.after all, it's a film about ants. well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug's life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? surely they jest. however, we forget that in toy story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug's life from the beginning. we shall start with our main character, and our hero. his name is flik (david foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful ant island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.the problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper (kevin spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. the cogs and clockwork in flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers.if you think about it, a bug's life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of akira kurosawa's classic seven samurai, or the american remake the magnificent seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. in a bug's life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. among them are an erudite stick insect (david hyde pierce), a side-splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (dennis hopper). it's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.as i've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. what makes a bug's life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. however, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.although a bug's life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood. they raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. what more is there to say about a bug's life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at emeryville, california, but this beats out the lot of its year  and i'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.8.5/10

you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.disney continues to firmly hold the title of "greatest animation in the world", with "a bug?s life" standing as one of their greatest achievements. one of the innovative attachments being the delightful "out-takes" added to the end of the film. the dvd has two sets of these out-takes where as i?m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape. the dvd also features "gerry?s game" which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.this is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to dreamworks? "antz", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. if you look at the star voices of both films, "antz" is largely cast with big name "movie" stars with a few familiar "tv" star voices, where "a bug?s life" is just the opposite, loaded with "tv" stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception. but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with disney, you have your work cut out for you. this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with. don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though.

critically, people say that antz is better. antz is a good film, but i enjoyed bug's life a bit more. i can't remember a pixar animation, other than the two toy story films, that i was laughing so hard. the animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. the voice overs are what make this movie. dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey, as is haydn panettiere as dot . there is also sterling support from dennis leary, david hyde pierce and madeline kahn, and i could go on and on. the script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. it lacks the social messages of antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. bethany cox

a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too. the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( a mirror of the magnifiscent seven). there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too. you will love it!! 8 out of 10

this is a funny film. it has all the usual disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say "antz" and "price of egypt".the characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.call me crazy, but i have seen the film three times, and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. i work in a multiplex, and i can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.see it, and don't be put off because it is animated. you are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.

there is great detail in a bug's life. everything is covered. the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. the film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on kurosawa's seven samurai, only with bugs. i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. check this one out.

"a bug's life" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.the story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has "heart" (emotion), and every character has a nice "arc" (a growth or change). by comparison, the only characters in "toy story" to have an "arc" are buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and woody, who overcomes his resentment of buzz. there are tons of laughs and cute moments in "a bug's life". all of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.this serious movie buff doesn't throw around "10"s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the "10" i gave it.

(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said a bug's life was too much, too fast--he was "dazed and exhausted" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)okay, first off, i'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'. so maybe i'm nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did i not come away from a bug's life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until i saw it the second time that i could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time i went to see this movie, i got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that i forgot that i was supposed to be sitting there being "wowed" by each frame visually. how can you not empathize with flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life? "heck" indeed, i found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...). of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!). but this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color. no, a bug's life would be static if it were all that and no story. but, i'm glad to say, it's not! a bug's life has real heart. yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them! just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think! besides that, i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has. this movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing. the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. it doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots. not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not "dumbing down" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not. all i can think is, if you can see a bug's life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point. final words: a+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie); if you loved toy story you'll most likely love this (pixar knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you still won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay?

i've seen this movie on several different occasions. i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.type 1: old people. a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue. as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old people walk out, usually disgusted.type 2: film snobs. these people think that just because a movie bears the label of "independent" that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow, overemotional crap that may or may not be in english. yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. they are really in for a surprise when they see this film. as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will walk out. a few will stay just to see "how bad it will get" and later they'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.type 3: people expecting to see live-action anime or matrix-like special effects. sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director yamasato really doesn't have the budget for that kind of thing.type 4: people with no expectations. these are the people who really enjoy the film. whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai, picked it at random, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is: entertainment. this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to "really kick some ass." and that's what it does.so depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends.

this movie for what it is, may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day. made on a super small budget, the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films! if you have a chance watch it!

this films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy b movie. it will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy. it should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese. but the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, "hmmmmm... that's so stupid!" and then have you laughing. for example, there is a scene back in "16th century japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. in the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts. hmmmm... hahahah! i could not stop laughing. and the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my lord, but that's what makes it funny. you'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible. i have to digress somewhat though because i have seen stephanie sanchez in several plays and she is awesome. her air time in the film was pretty short though. i have also seen bryan yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie. anyhow, it's an entertaining film, if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening.

i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival. wow! blood just blew us away with its sheer verve, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, utter campiness, and even more gore, and all in such great fun! especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films, you definitely have to see blood!

a fabulous film. with everything you could want in a film. huge battle scenes and lots of other action. suspense, and a romantic love story. kind of like an old swashbuckler film. totally entertaining from start to finish. the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second. the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household. the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent. the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative. the special effects are amazing too.gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at. he looks like a sure bet for super stardom. john rhys-davies is wonderful as he usually is. he is one of the great actors of our time.and cindy burbridge, ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even doing an english accent with remarkable success. i found out that the film has won numerous awards, and i can see why.all in all this is an amazing independent film. see it for sure. i highly recommend it. and give it a ten +!!!

i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction. the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting...the portuguese, the japanese, and the various communities being managed by the king. the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason. the wardrobe is fine. the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production. the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting. it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective.

dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.the game play is basically "kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door" over and over until the level is done.there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.dead to rights is also a hard game.you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol.near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.dead to rights is as gory as it is hard.if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.family fun for everyone.

i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne, when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade-like game with a desire to rip-off the max payne style (not just bullet-time). so when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is! and how different from "max payne", yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game-style. this game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, so much fun, as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that "bullet-time" you should definitely own this game.

there have been far too few mainstream films set in post-colonial africa, and the ones that have are a mixed bunch. this one, with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows the best and worst values of africa, which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole. it also has shortcomings, given the undue influence of western pre-conceptions of africans and, especially, arabs.dr anansa linderby, the beautiful african-american wife of the english doctor david linderby, is captured by arab slave-traders, along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy. the lead slave-trader, suleiman, is every bit the stage arab, with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on "carry on follow that camel" but are not up the standard this film deserves. peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one-dimensional character.continuing the stereotypical theme, all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy, which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat. david then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an englishman (walker, played by rex harrison) and an american (sandell, played by william holden). sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed-race relationships, who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front. won over by david's love for anansa, and conscious of his own inability to find love, he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa. they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is shot down but david survives.we then see david introduced to malik (kabir bedi), an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance. they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman.in one of the most heart-rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group, and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier.later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and, in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen. anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees.by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market.suleiman, now in no doubt that anansa is "trouble", attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince (omar sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u.n., the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences. the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film.at the slave market, the young boy is sold to a middle-aged german paedophile, and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered "wunderbar" when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch-doctoring skills.david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter-sweet ending from malik's point of view.ultimately, david and anansa are re-united, and malik, whose life is in ruins, can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed.the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters. credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting.

ashanti is a very 70s sort of film (1979, to be precise). it reminded me of the wild geese in a way (richard burton, richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa). it's a very good film too, and i enjoyed it a lot.david (michael caine) is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa (beverley johnson) who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor. while they're doctoring, one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman (played perfectly by peter ustinov, of all people). the rest of the film is david trying to get her back.michael caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back, but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff. he's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on (rex harrison!), then briefly by a helicopter pilot (william holden), and then by an arab called malik (kabir bedi). malik has a score to settle with suleiman (he is very intense throughout, a very engaging character), and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel.then there's lots of adventure. there's also lots of morality-questioning. the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point, and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster, but it's all pretty forgivable. the question is, will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif (yes, of course omar sharif is in it!)?

let's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck , but i dare say , not as pretty as katee as starbuck . i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar , war of the gods , the best was experiment in terra , i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait , then you had the women of battlestar , not to compare them to let's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six , but jane seymour's beauty could not be compared to . let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . i loved the original as much as the new .can you imagine if john calicos had a number six ? :)thankyou for listening .

this movie is pretty good. half a year ago, i bought it on dvd. but first i thought that it was the original film. i have seen the series and it is a good film, but here, they have put "the living legend,part1 and 2",and "fire in space" together. the same as they did with the first film, but with other episodes. but still, it is a pretty good film. only the ending is strange (you don't see what happens with the pegasus). but i still think that it is pretty good. the actors and special effects were good. if you haven't seen it, go see it. starring:richard hatch, dirk benedict, lorne greene, herb. jefferson jr., tony swartz, terry carter, lloyd bridges, jack stauffer.

although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: "fire in space" and "living legend", if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out. i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. i would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on vhs. they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now. another good video is conquest for the earth, which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves. overall, i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.

as i said in my comment about the first part: these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess.the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.but when battlestar pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the cylon planets. okay, it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant earth, but it works for me. it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).i would have loved a continuation with starbuck and apollo on board. instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...so thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.

i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie. john wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods. but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. the duke was a guy who really could act well. his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. many of his good intentions came a cropper. he had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. the set pieces were complex and detailed. a lot of money and thought had been applied to it.the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. script was good without being too wordy. there was a great deal of japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative. it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. whether or not they were japanese, i couldn't say. but anyway they looked the part. at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians, unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley' (yes, i know they were chinese) 'the inn of the sixth happiness' or even 'the king and i'.frankly, i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. the script was better for a start. i never liked the songs in 'the king and i', and wasn't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'blood alley'. i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke's more popular outings.recommended.

in the barbarian and the geisha, john wayne plays townsend harris, a real envoy from the united states who was responsible for truly opening up japan to international relations in the late 1850s. before him, commodore perry basically pushed into japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the japanese in 1853. harris, who arrived just a bit later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty. all this is true and shown in the film. according to some other sources i found, the romance between harris and a japanese geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film (hence, the title).my first reaction the first time i saw this movie was one of surprise. john wayne as a diplomat?! when he's being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you as he pummels people!!!! so seeing him playing a man who is not a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed. in fact, i can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role. by the way, i've seen photos of harris and wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all.however, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very watchable. the color cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice insights into japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad. all in all, a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting.ps--read through the trivia for this film. you find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between wayne and the director (john huston) where wayne apparently knocked him out!! based on what i've read about huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident i tend to believe. and, it's also a nice example of john wayne "diplomacy".

this is very much not the sort of movie for which john wayne is known. he plays a diplomat, a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action. the film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story.for the open-minded, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history.there are two intertwining stories. the big story is of internalised, isolationist japan and externalised, expansionist america clashing when their interests conflict. the small, human, story is of an outsider barbarian (wayne) and a civilised geisha's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love. the human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations.the movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. the two lead roles are performed to perfection. john wayne is excellent as townsend harris, striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the japanese. eiko ando is likewise excellent as the geisha of the title, charming and delightful. the interaction between her character and john wayne's is particularly well portrayed. this is exactly how these two individuals (as they are depicted in the film) would have behaved.the script is very well written. it lacks all pomposity. and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred. the characters are real people, not self-consciously "great" figures from history. furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. indeed, the clash of a traditionalist, and traditionally powerful, isolationist japan and a rising, newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between john wayne and the local japanese baron. wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in japan, and that passing ships cannot even put into port for water. the baron responds that japan just wants to be left alone. wayne's character replies that japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping, and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway. a very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right, and saw the other as being in the wrong. the resultant clash between two self-righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history, a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future.cinematography and the depiction of mid-nineteenth century japan, before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century, is excellent. a visual treat, and an enlightening insight into japan's ancient civilisation.i highly recommend anyone, whether a john wayne fan or not, to watch this film if you get the chance. just be aware that it isn't an action film. it is a representation of an interesting place and time in history, and a slow-boiling love story which (much to their surprise) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. watch this film on its merits, without preconceptions, allow yourself to be immersed in its story, and you will thoroughly enjoy it.all in all, an excellent film.

an interesting look at japan prior to opening to the west. john wayne as america's first consul to japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from perry's gunboat diplomacy. he is not welcome. wayne eventually wins his meeting with the shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an american ship, under control. there follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the shogun, including a bottle of old tanglefoot. the meeting with the shogun, the debates among the japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period. altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.

"deliverance" is a dead-on example of what wonderful movies came out of the '70s. while your jaw is dropped during a "terminator" movie, are you really sacred? i don't think so, because you are there to see what new cgis have been strung together - plot matters not.so many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. "deliverance" is so frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of "trespassing" into territories where outsiders are not welcome. it is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on "deliverance" didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and "squeal like a pig" wasn't a part of "deulling banjos".i hate the term "hillbillies", because - as some "users" wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. much is made of "inbred" - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. "chinatown" should teach us that lesson. however, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. i know lots of "hillbillies" - they are moral people, when left to themselves. their "justice" can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the "justice" in city streets. they don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites."deliverance" was the last film i found jon voight to do any real acting - i hope i'm wrong. he was extremely underpaid for "midnight cowboy", because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. his acting in "deliverance" was superb. it gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as "ordinary" today? his stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. wow! for burt reynolds !!! one must ask what led him into those other tacky films? his manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. ned beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had "versace" stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. as noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. ronny cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. several "users" have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. no gunshot was heard during the scene and voight and beatty did not find a wound.james dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. his character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in "aintry". he was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. justice ? - "don't come back up here again". not many "users" knew "hillbillies" were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? the "mountain-men" were actually mountain-men.......every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. play in? better "fight-for-your-life" in. i've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.that we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. to be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. los angeles, where i live, is a perfect example: it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? they're theirs.in some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from "deliverance" - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. i thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when i watch it. you can have the thrill of danger - i'll stick to the tv. 30-out-of-10.

one of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from atlanta. the idea of living the chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from burt reynold's lewis, who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare. but if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. in very bad ways. at the end of the movie, each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival. the movie (except some pretty evident goofs) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath. the photography is excellent as well. voight, reynolds, cox and beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake.

this movie is a classic in every sense of the word. it is very entertaining and also very disturbing. the acting in this movie is well done. the story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. the villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. this movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. it is definitely worth watching. this movie is a masterpiece.

i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience. as we put our boats into the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature. we see it in the bow fishing. we see it in the home made tent. there is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman "cracker". the fact that the banker from atlanta (ned beatty) has "bad teeth" is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth. ultimately, the struggle of life and death supersedes "civilized man's" suppositives about "the law". this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer, but alas not soon enough for the characters.

and this is a very disturbing film. i may be wrong, but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor, who transformed the role, and delivered a message.jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent. they are unassuming and unaware; businessmen wanting to enjoy the country. little did they know what would happen next.the photography and sets are realistic and natural. this was before the days of wes craven.what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist. in america, country folk still detest city people; it is almost a century and a half since the civil war.you will enjoy this film. it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia, which still exist. just don't drive past that to mobile, alabama; that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina. 10/10.

*spoilers* four men, ed (jon voight), lewis (burt reynolds), drew (ronny cox) and bobby (ned beatty), decide to go on a rafting trip on the cahulawassee river, before it is flooded.they wanted to have fun, to have a nice weekend in the nature.but when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (bobby), everything begins to go to hell in a handbasket, and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life...'deliverance', which in italian is stupidly titled 'un tranquillo weekend di paura' ('a calm weekend of fear'), is the grandad of movies like 'texas chainsaw massacre', 'the hills have eyes', 'wrong turn', 'last house on the left' and all the other 'evil nature/revenge' subgenre films, and one of the scariest, right next to 'the hills have eyes'.based on a book by james dickey (who appears in the movie as sheriff bullard), it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he doesn't.and the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water, or the hands holding the rifle from the one-sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind.deliverance: 9/10.

impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip, on a river about to be replaced by a dam. when locals along the way decide to "have their way" with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors. each of the travelers is outstanding, although voight gives the lead and strongest performance. the rural scenery and culture is well-captured, including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence. i saw this on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). i sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for burt, voight was already established. not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed.

i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated. i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time. i certainly did. this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever. i can't believe i thought this film was boring! a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox. this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it, it is truly horrifying. oh, and did i mention that the theme song is great, as well? well it is, and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere.everyone should see this movie for the experience. just don't expect a picnic.

deliverance is john boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen (burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty and ronnie cox), that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed. along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. despite the nasty happenings in this picture, boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. the location was really chosen well. indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond. it has been said that burt reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, lewis, is the star acting role in this film. i reckon however, that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. in fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. it was voight himself. to cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. eric weissberg's and steve mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. at a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film, i did find it a little lacking in purpose. it doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. the plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. i did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. none really, in fact. it isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. think of it like rambo: first blood meets three men in a boat. look out for a very young charley boorman as ed's son. i did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.

"it's all up to you, ed?" "now you get to play the game." the day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the cinerama dome in hollywood. i was but fourteen years old. i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing, but i will never forgot it, especially the scene with ned beatty.watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.my father was a huge burt reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' i had seen two films at the dome prior to this: "grand prix" and "the song of norway." well this wasn't exactly mario andretti or the brady bunch. after leaving the theater, i was shell-shocked.but even at that tender age, i appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. i don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.as an adult, i still find it quite disturbing, yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.burt reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from billy redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to ronny cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. the sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. the photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.the moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. these four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.it's a classic to be sure. and the phrase "you have a pretty mouth" has been quoted endlessly, from saturday night live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as "make my day" or "i'll be back" ever were.so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? and if you took the measures burt reynolds did (and i would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? the bottom line is: deliverance delivers. you can take that to the bank. if this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.my favorite part of the film remains the same: ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight, in particular, as ed, gives the best performance here. and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history, from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d. roosevelt in pearl harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed. i guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.ten out of ten stars.

when a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film. although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. i say, proudly, that i am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. movies like breakdown and the missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think "holy crap, that could happen to me", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. because i am only 21, i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds, jon voight and ned beatty, albeit i am familiar with them, i didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long. i must say, after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time, i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. burt renyolds plays lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers, drew and bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight, once again i have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike renyolds, i have quite liked voight's acting (and i don't regard anaconda when i say that), for example the national treasure movies. voight plays ed, whom, like lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis' machismo. the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous "duelling banjo's" at the start of the film with ronny cox's character drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. as with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. the film's cinematics do not let up, and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film. in wrapping up, deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.

this is one of the greatest films ever made. it's an all-time classic. the character played by ned beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed. he is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance salesman. he is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges the "backwards hicks" to be the ignorant ones. when he compliments the old man on his hat, and the old man responds, "you don't know nothing'," the tone is set. it's true. he really doesn't "know nothing'." but one backwoods anal rape later, the man is practically a warrior. his shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve. the old self is forever dead, left in some far off woods, soon to be under hundreds of feet of water. and what of lewis, our intrepid guide? lewis is a philosopher/hunter/warrior, and he's just about nuts. burt reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film, completely giving himself in to this wonderful role. who wouldn't want to have a friend like lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in. this film speaks to us on so many levels. the story feels real. it works as a complete action/adventure, with wonderful cinematography, and deliberate, grinding pacing. it works as a bit of a horror film, with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their "sow" ned beatty. but it also works as an art film, using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core. i have seen this film at least fifty times, and every time it comes on, i find i have to watch it. you have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it. this is one deep movie. this is one well-acted movie. and this is one hell of a story. i gave it a 10 out of 10, and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made, along with schindler's list, casablanca, taxi driver, and sling blade, among others. movies that make you think. movies that take you beyond having to think. movies that use a story to make their point, without trying to preach to you. if you think you know deliverance, you might, but again, you might not. it really is that good.

before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film, but listening wasn't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow! ned beatty, ronny cox, jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all. the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend. the acting, dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting. reynolds character "lewis" was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man (i was impressed with his performance!) jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too, and they did... i really was amazed at director boorman's vision of dickey's novel, very impressed. you cannot go your whole life without watching this film. i give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.

"deliverance" is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came.a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives. it's awesome.we are treated to anal rape, vicious beatings, bow and arrow killings, shootings, broken bones, etc... a lot like 1974's "texas chainsaw massacre," to say that "deliverance" is believable would be immature. this would never and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972."deliverance" is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action. it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70's and it (arguably) sits on top of that pile with it's great acting, superb cinematography and excellent writing.8 out of 10, kids.

the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters,as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors,playing parts.i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one.burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen,as well as fine performances by ned beatty,ronny cox,bill mckinney,and though he appeared only briefly,james dickey,the man who authored the book upon which the film is based,as the sheriff of aintry.it is somewhat disturbing,and kids,of course,should be shielded from it,but this is great,dramatic cinema.

deliverance is a stunning thriller, every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach-churningly frightening. though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. the very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population. it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity. with so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl.... but with deliverance, you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.four city guys - ed (jon voight), lewis (burt reynolds), drew (ronny cox) and bobby (ned beatty) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river. the guys are riding the rapids in pairs, and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland. here, they fall foul of two local woodlanders (bill mckinney and herbert coward), who tie ed to a tree, while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him, perversely, to "squeal like a pig". lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis, being a fair archer, kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest. under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream, and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters. though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down. the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction. the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves. this truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest.

it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos. even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene. it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction. it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.the acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma. the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter. the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them. the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires. not many films can make you feel this creeped out. bottom line: this movie is a classic. i can't really say much more than that.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** packed with memorable moments (such as the quote above, immortalized by primus), deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn. this is not a hollywood film. there are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. the city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy louis, portrayed with precision by burt reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. this is a perfect example of a what-if film. what if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there, and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. this communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. while drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. when the boy turns away from drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. this great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until o brother, where art thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. these people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. the people that louis, bobby, drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include thou shalt not kill. confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.(spoilers) when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the assaults and actual murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. there is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. the trip down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up the majority of the film, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing.this is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. the hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like gator bait and gator bait 2, neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance. when we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we, as individuals of the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. it's not often that a film is able to come across that way.

this is without a doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen. the first time i saw it i was about 9 or 10 years old. i began looking sometime before the rape scene. and when i saw it i was really shocked thinking "what kinda sick movie is this?". today i've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is. it's exciting, frightening, shocking and in it's own unique way disturbing. but the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes. it'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river. and there is nothing they can do about it, it's something they have to live with. this ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart, brilliant and horrifyingand the acting is also great, especially jon voight and burt reynolds. magnificent acting in this movie. all in all, john boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on dick chaney's novel. a must see for all the movie lovers

james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. when one reads "deliverance", one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south. when one watches john boorman's film version of the book, one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book. the camera is as descriptive as the narration. the characters are fully realized, and the portrayals are fantastic. i first saw this movie in 1992, after my freshman year of college. i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973. among them were "patton", "papillon", and "all the president's men"; fine films, all of them. this one was easily the class of the group. that says a lot.

engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. they are pacifist ed (jon voight), adventurous, violent lewis (burt reynolds), obnoxious bobby (ned beatty) and nice guy drew (ronny cox). the first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence, interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by vilmos zsigmond. then two hillbillies attack ed and bobby. one of them rapes bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.just unbelievable. the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. to be truthful, beatty's rape has never bothered me--i'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. this movie also shows how the characters change--ed has his pacifism tested, lewis becomes weak, bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane. direction by john boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.the acting is mostly good. voight is just ok in the lead--he's been better. beatty is also just ok--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. and reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs ever! how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me. also bill mckinney and herbert coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.a powerful film--not for children. try to see an uncut version--the tv version is butchered. also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images.

this was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen. the first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. the journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia. but that is misleading beyond belief. the obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. i can still hear bobby moaning in pain, and i shudder at the thought. lewis's leg made me wince. yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. when is it moral, or right to take another individual's life? what can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).

i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep. this, in itself, was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie. i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film. how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were. case in point - near the end of the "duel", the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the "duel", the kid was too reserved to respond. the river trip never left you bored, for sure. the rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia. i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal. i disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy. it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.anyway, a great movie, and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a "1", i gave it a "10". this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.

as peckinpah did with straw dogs, and kubrick with a clockwork orange, director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance, arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. burt reynolds, jon voight, ned beatty, and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls "one big, dead lake."but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these "city boys" carousing through their woods. and the following day, continuing on down the river, beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous "squeal!" sequence) by two vicious mountain men (bill mckinney, herbert "cowboy" coward). thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. often known for its "squeal!" and "dueling banjos" sequences, deliverance is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men superb in their roles, and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. a must-see film for those willing to take a chance.

john boorman's "deliverance" concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawassee the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land the four friends emphasize different characters: a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it (burt reynolds); a passionate family man and a guitar player (ronny cox); an overweight bachelor insurance salesman (ned beatty); and a quiet, thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe (jon voight).what follows is the men's nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of natureit is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness superbly shot, this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes

after having seen deliverance, movies like pulp fiction don't seem so extreme. maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.when i started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until i got to the "dueling banjos" scene. in that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. as i watched drew(ronny cox,robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. when you think that the kid has a small banjo, which he could of probably made by hand, compared to drew's nice expensive guitar, you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.as the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. but what really distinguishes this film, about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director john boorman(excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. so as the movie goes into full horror and suspense i really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.the acting is universally excellent. with jon voight(midnight cowboy, enemy of the state) and burt reynolds(boogie nights, striptease) leading the great cast. jon voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. unlike reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. ned beatty(life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while ronny cox turns in a believable performance.one thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any i had ever seen. bill mckinney and herbert "cowboy" coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.overall deliverance was excellent and i suggest it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 10/10. see this movie.

deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by james dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by john boorman. it's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! these four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. all these elements actually make deliverance one of the most nightmarish films i've ever seen. just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. pure talking cinema, deliverance is a very important movie as well. john boorman's best (closely followed by zardoz and excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. just think about the terrific "duelling banjos" musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene. all the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. especially jon voight. a must see motion picture!!

in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city guys confront nature's wrath, in a story of survival. the setting is backwoods georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.the director, john boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. no central casting "actors" could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices, or actions. i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. as much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.another strength is the film's theme. nature, in the wild, can be violent. how appropriate that the setting should be the american south. very few places in the u.s. are, or have been, as violent as redneck country. in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it."deliverance" is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. the film's magnificent scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. and that is another strength of the film.at an entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, as the plot proceeds. not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. direction and editing are flawless. cinematography is excellent. dialogue is interesting. and the acting is terrific. burt reynolds has never been better. ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar. if there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which strikes me as timid.overall, "deliverance" almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film, one of the finest in cinema history.

'deliverance' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature, and instead have to fight for their sanity, their lives, and perhaps even their souls. the film has aged well. despite being made in the early seventies, it certainly doesn't look particularly dated. it still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'death of the sixties' philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle. there are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it, although the legendary sam peckinpah's stuff would have to be up there. yes, there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene (which i won't expand upon here) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times. this seems to be generally overlooked (yet in retrospect quite understandably so). the cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing, fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning, and it counterbalances the film as, in a moment of brief madness, we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare. 'deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy, and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment, through to crisis, and aftermath. it all takes place very quickly, which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film. the setting is established effectively through the opening credits. the characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story. we know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell. the conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. this is author james dickey's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore. there are no demons or bogeymen here. the predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists. they shock because their evil is petty and tangible. the film has no peripheral characters. all reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised homo sapiens in the latter 20th century, and all are very real and recognisable. burt reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident survivalist, lewis, and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career ('boogie nights' excluded, perhaps). trust me, if your are not a reynolds fan, you will be impressed with his performance here. john voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self, and ned beatty and ronny cox both make significant contributions. this is simply a great quartet of actors. to conclude, i must speculate as to if and when 'deliverance' author james dickey's 'to the white sea' will be made. for those that enjoyed (?) this film, ttws is a similarly harrowing tale of an american air force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the japanese mainland during ww2. it's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is dickey's trademark, but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular, poetic cinematic experience. there was the suggestion a few years ago that the coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing. being an avid coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on ttws, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts. returning to 'deliverance', it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful. we, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.

unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (man bites dog) or their sheer violence (most peckinpah films), deliverance shocks by its plausibility. certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. burt reynolds, too, has never been better. the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of. although so much of it is excellent of itself, deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.

a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the warriors father (or whoever he was). and they travel through the nature of africa's most ruff areas.the acting in this movie isn't that good (except for that elephant kid). but it's a very good adventure and it's not very censored, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten up the movie a bit).i give this movie a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action.

i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb. it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb. at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it. huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them. all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film. but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film. it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all.

i had seen this movie when it got released, and when i was 12 years old :) and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! i think many so-called action movies copied a lot many "escape scenes" from this movie!! and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) the lead actors have acted wonderfully. the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. as children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!! --vijay.

i liked this movie very much. although this movie doesn't boast of big (or even known) names, its very charming. its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end. my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part. i rate this movie at 7.5

this is a movie that has a lot of things that only japanese people can understand. even well translated, there are some things that are obviously private jokes or regional symbolism. my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort, but that just got wasted on me.what i felt that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effects. some kid becomes "the one" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway. it would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the azumi bean washing yokai and the one that looks like a big tongued umbrella (rihanna eat your heart out!) i couldn't really discern the plot.bottom line: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the river princess is terrible cute and the rest is crap.

the only reason i'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi's tormentors were not up to the job. i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance. i say not to judge this by u.s. standards because it's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints u.s. kids' films are routinely subjected to. for example, there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai, and shojo--the avuncular kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do. hint: this would not happen in a disney film. this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids' movie. early on, there's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out. it was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up. then, someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune, but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead. i mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and i didn't hear any objections to it while i was there. there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in "the great yokai war" than one would find in a disney movie. as a parent, if this were a u.s. film, i would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. since it's a japanese movie, i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u.s. production. however, i'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff, or i'd wait till they're older to show it to them.

i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i was so impressed.everything about it was superb. the acting the characters, the story. a believable child who grew into brave, always willing to help others. his mum must be proud. i could not take my eyes off this film for fear of missing something. it is the prefect fable/tale with morals, cute and scary sprites and 'monsters' but nevertheless heartwarming folk. a child poked and bullied at school who becomes a hero. picked to be a rider at the local village festival and a journey to the goblin mountain where he discovers the yokai, who are amazing creations that brian froud would be proud of. and the evil kato and his off sider who definitely needed a hug. these evil people capture the yokai and throw them into a red pit along with unwanted objects, like motorbikes and other mechanical things and these meld into one horribly violent robotic monsters whose only job is to kill. takashi a young boy is the one to become their saviour, alongside a red man/dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a cute little creature that, if it had been america they could have turned it into a cuddly toy and sold it at all good toy stores. the lines are good especially the don't try this at home kids and other gems that bring a smile to your lips. suspend belief and watch this with a child or on your own and enjoy! though i must admit that the end was a wee bit sad. and not necessarily so. cheers furdion

takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film, because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love: visitor q, gozu, izo, ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy. lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he's succeeding. still this was the first of his films i'd seen him take that direction, so i was nervous. of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did.great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too. the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child: neverending story, labyrinth, return to oz, etc. i enjoyed those films because they didn't treat kids like they're stupid and this one doesn't either. the dark underlying morals are there, but, it's also as silly as any kids film should be. i personally wasn't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics. i feel like they fit well and don't think kids will notice.if you are a die hard takashi miike fan, you may not like this one. but, i suggest giving it a shot. it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is. he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones, which is very reassuring.to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one, i suggest these other miike films: 'zebraman' 'the happiness of the katakuris' 'sabu' and 'the bird people in china.' good job takashi miike! 8/10 stars.

"yokai daisenso" is a children's film by takashi miike, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones. however, older children may well eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in english.the story is that of a young boy, who has moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. during a village festival the boy is chosen as a "kirin rider", a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course.meanwhile, evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go boots & a beehive hair-do, teams up with an evil yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them. and this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the city of rage itself, tokyo. one quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, "oh, it's only gamera". the young boy has befriended yokai, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the yokai in japan band together to fight the evil.in many ways miike & crew have taken the late 60's/early 70's yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for (older) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of "transformers". the look and feel of the film is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads, but still, older ones might enjoy it. as for adults, there's not much here not to like, if you're a fan of japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this.cool & fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just miike..and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.

yokai monsters: spook warfare (yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional japanese "monsters" of folklore. it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade.the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak, kappa water imp, a living 'brella, a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist, & so on.these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore, but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era, comparable to today's halloween haunted houses, or the "freak shows" of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks. ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create "chills" during the hot summers. the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky, this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills.these rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord. despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy, & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak, it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming. it has some beautiful cinematography, much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade. viewed in the right mood or with the right friends, it is exciting, moving & touching.yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub: white heaven & hell (1974) &and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy. the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best, but the yokai are nevertheless great fun. the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films, with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers.

2005 toronto film festival report it is official; "takashi miike" is whacked.the annual midnight screening of the new "takashi miike" film, "the big spook war" or "the great yokai war" or "yôkai daisensô". call it what you will this is a fanatical ride.colin geddes, the fearless programmer stated this film was originally geared towards children in japan. think of "lord of the rings" or "neverending story" for japan. after the screening i can understand where they were going with that, but damn this is "takashi miike" after all. he directed the '01 film "ichi the killer", when it screening at the festival barf bags were handed out at the screening. and no, that wasn't just a marketing ploy.plot summary: a young boy with a troubled home life becomes "chosen," and he stumbles into the middle of a great spirit war, where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his companions through his journey.this is not really for kids, well not 'too' young. certainly see them getting scared shitless with some of these spirits (even the friendly ones) on display. this is unlike anything i've seen in the movie theater before. a fantasy naturally, some very funny (but dark) material. you will not be bored can guarantee that. will this ever hit north america? doubtful.my rating = b

what a strangely wonderful, if sometimes slight and bulky, big-budget fantasy this is. takashi miike had already proved, by the time he got to the great yokhai war, that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (visitor q and andromedia showed this, the former great the latter lesser). but here miike, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of cgi, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a "festival" than something out of lord of the rings. the comparisons can be made far and wide, to be sure, and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki, for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes, power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source, machinery as the greatest evil, and many bizarrely defined, flamboyantly designed creatures (or yokai of the title). but there can also be comparisons made to star wars, especially to the gungan battle in tpm, and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. or to anime like samurai 7. or, of course, to henson's films. and through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. here, ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. the darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the yokhai, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato's main minion and cohort, agi (kill bill's chiaki kuriyama, another great villainies) steals tadashi's little furry companion, a sunekosuri. soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by miike and his crew. i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids, but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in american circles. this has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by sato. so the variety is on high on that end, and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the "festival" hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. but there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark, and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike's disposal (and not just because it's cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury, who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form? yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike's career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, muppet and sci-fi counterparts. there's the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (i loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-yokai). the biggest danger with miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end. he's got everything down, i'm sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and tadashi and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat. i almost wondered if miike might dip into (bad) spy kids territory, quite frankly.but this liability aside, the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement, goofy thrills, and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. it owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. it's not the filmmaker at his very best, but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. it's got a neat little message, and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10

paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up.tony shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist (phd) who cannot find decent work in america. he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab.the chief doctor is a bitter man, as paulie, who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn, embarasses the doctor, who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building, where mikail (tony s.) finds him.paulie recants his life with marie and how they lost each other. the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie, only more than 20 years has passed.the movie ends, some will say predictably, with mikail reuniting paulie with marie. the story closes with the three entering marie's home, where you can make the final your own choice.great family film!

i know, i know: it's childish. but i just love this type of movie. a bird that suffered a lot of "mishaps" and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor. what's special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie -the parrot- and he's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor. furthermore i like the storyline: paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom. (by the way: jay mohr's voice almost sounds like joe pesci's!). and cheech marin of course, the man is humor to me. ever since i saw "up in smoke" i have appreciated his naive way of performing, making a simple situation a hilarious one.. can't help myself.

paulie sounds like the most saccharine, lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find, yet it's actually much better than you might expect. the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film, but actually in most other departments the film is charming.in case you're wondering, paulie is a parrot. bought for a little girl with speech difficulties, paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. however, paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n.y.c to l.a to be re-united with her.so, why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well? firstly, it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving, often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline. thirdly, it has several surprisingly strong performances, including jay mohr as a wily crook, gena rowlands as a kind old lady, and cheech marin (yes, the dope-smoking cheech marin!) as a musical immigrant. it might not be a classic, but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.

i didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like "citizen kane" and "seven samaurai." however, this movie is so all-around wonderful, it's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter. however, the imdb voter leans to the geeky, and "paulie" doesn't qualify for that.the only acting criticism i might suggest is that hallie kate eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. i'm sorry, but asking a 6 year-old child to out-do dustin hoffman as the rainman is asking for the impossible in film-making.moving past that minor complaint, the movie has the best of many films: buddy road-trip, con-games, hero as friendly party-animal (party-bird?), disney-like humor for young and old, etc. what's not to like? tony shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. that's normal for him, it seems. ("i'm russian... i like long stories.) i don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one. watch the movie and that will make sense.buddy hackett and cheech marin make very appropriate appearances in the film. roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them. i have always found jay mohr to be a bit slimy, and his on-screen role fits that as well. the only surprise to me was finding that jay was also paulie's voice. in the end, even that works well; put parrot and anti-parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own.if you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either, "paulie" is a perfect candidate. i will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of "paulie." i was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave. the car's air-conditioning died, half the restaurants had dead cooling (as did our hotel) and i said, "let's watch a movie where there is working air-conditioning." so we did. so for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused, and given a heart-warming experience. when i saw it recently on vcr under less emotional circumstances, i realized just how well this movie was made.it's a sleeper film you won't regret watching.

most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie,you must be really bored. actually,i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was,"paulie". i had missed the opening credits,so i didn't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it,so i naturally thought i had tuned into "born in east l.a." when i saw him talking to a talking parrot,i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.happy to say,it was better than that. as you know,if you don't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner. seems it's taken years to find her. what should be paulie's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways. people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves. while cheech marin's character "is" making money from him,he's not mean to him. the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute,i found them amusing.paulie,who's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people. especially the owner of an animal research lab. the man lies to him saying he'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research. paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie's vocal ability.throughout the film paulie's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him,several other animals and finding the location of paulie's owner. it's a touching reunion. 8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown. that part might bother younger children. otherwise,it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart. (end)

the movie was very sweet and heartwarming! i cry almost every time i watch the movie. i would recommend this movie for every one. the movie was so inspiring to me. the actors did a great job of acting, and the movie was very well played and done. the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie. paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her.after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement. finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor. had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life. in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie (the little girl who raised paulie). love overcame all the obstacles.

this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids. the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level. i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny, entertaining,and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years. i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining. this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life. this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right. i recommend this movie to anyone of any age.

made me wish my own happy birds could talk. tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie. a sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. paulie is a lovable little treasure. he has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh. i especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint. you can forgive the obvious clichés as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with marie. a charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner. would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey. i liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, a shame she could not share paulie's reunion. bless paulie in his new home, at last with marie, perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.

i have to tell you, this is a great movie. it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be. this one is just fabulous. it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message; it just tells a whimsical, fun story. i gave it a 10 out of 10.

a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a "children's film", and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. takashi miike uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children's fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war.the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the "hero" in this years annual festival, only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined. what follows is a hallucinatory, grotesque, whimsical, and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore, but wait there's also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world. however, the villain here, is not a mere demon, it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans "use" and "discard". usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment, the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game, sonic the hedghog, might remember a certain dr. robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly's who sonic had to then "liberate").the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character, essentially playing the straight man, in a world gone suddenly mad. though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers, as do many of the yokia themselves, who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots, some spirits being umbrellas with eyes, talking walls, or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans...of course in this magical world of miike's yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them.in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children's fantasy, as few, if any, of the characters are heroic, their victory being a combination of happenstance, almost arbitrary faith, and a desire to party. the yokai spirits, only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout, after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival, and even then only to dance and party. also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all's well that ends well fantasy ending, but with a final scene, showing our hero years older, with an adult job, now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth, who then despondently turn to the villain, who being a spirit can never really die. this ending, with it's yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon's pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of over-consumption. the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them(in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit), and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence, they become soulless vengeful machines, not unlike those seen in modern video games, suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die, but can become deformed.this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to, and i believe it shows, as there's a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness. though i've focused mostly on the story (since lots of users here seem to write it off), i do want to say that visually it's a kaleidescope of cgi, stop animation, costume, and live puppetry, that works remarkably well. there's a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted, as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either. the yokai are beaten, brutalized, and turned into machines of living hate, who i believe even kill a few humans, a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening, while a sexual undercurrent, the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero, or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy, seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes, especially when considering this is a "children's film". however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough, not to traumatize any children to bad. grims fairy tales, before revisions, did much worse, far more often.all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet, with enough visual drama and great performances(the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them, thats laugh out loud funny at times) to appeal to audiences of all ages, and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth. the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them, but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood. another beautiful, funny, and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn't come close to his apex. instant classic.

this is such a great movie to watch with young children. i'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over. gena was good, cheech was fun,the russian was good, maria was adorable & of course paulie was the best!

add paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters. this movie is a love story - bird and gena rowlands, bird and beloved marie, michael and marie. a russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after marie's parents sell him to a pawn shop. before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of paulie. cheech marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous. beautiful photography throughout. great little movie, word of mouth will make it a cult favorite.

i absolutely loved this movie! it was so good! this movie is told by the parrot, paulie's point of view. paulie is given to the little girl marie, as a present. paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends. but when paulie tells marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. that's when the adventure begins. paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie. this movie is so sweet, funny, touching, sad, and more. when i first watched this movie, it made me cry. the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time, was so touching. i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you'll have to watch it to find out how it goes. at the end, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story. will he find his long lost marie or not? find out when you watch this sweet, heart warming movie. it'll touch your heart. rating:10

spoiler this is a great film about a conure. he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner. he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds. if you love birds like my wife does, this film is for you. this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run. in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend. rent this for the whole family, everyone will enjoy this.

this movie brought tears to my eyes; john roberts really knew how to get to viewers' hearts, directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie. we discover from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john, that even small creatures like paulie have a heart. i just couldn't stop my tears, even though the film has a happy end. this is great, after thousands of films i saw through my life, "paulie" really touched me deeply. this is, after the "ugly duckling", the second picture that really turned me upside down.

a very refreshing story, the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human's. shows humans from a bird's point of view. especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with. not all birds are bird-brained...

a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. it's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot paulie. the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion.the parrot is definitely the star of the film. at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way. the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists.early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re-united with his mistress. one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines. paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory.the ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie's antics.

a talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film, but paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant, heartwarming film that will delight the whole family. it manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during marie and paulie's separation, and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion. the animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. paulie is a great character and should have received way more success, though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998, unlike saving private ryan. this hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember. paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner, you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way. not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10

i approach films about talking animals with care. for every wonderful one like babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound: the incredible journey. or in the case of cats & dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. when i heard about paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. but i found the film a pleasant surprise. and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.a russian janitor, misha vilyenkov (tony shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. one day, he hears singing coming from the basement. and when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. and not a few phrases either. its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.the parrot is called paulie (voiced by jay mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in misha. wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story. which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. the two of them became birds of a feather (ok, bad pun!).when marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly. desperate to be reunited with her, paulie begins a long journey across america, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. of a cage that is!paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s. and although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe, paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.jay mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie. he never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart aleck. paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.because he's lived a rather sheltered life with marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. and when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie, which he believes. only for those promises to be broken time and again.paulie is admittedly a little episodic. it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie. he first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by ivy (gena rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. she sympathises with paulie's situation, and drives an rv across america to find marie.paulie is an occasionally very touching film. his scenes with ivy are some of the best. wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers. the way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: "there are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later. but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later."the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over.despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant. the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. and paulie even gets to have a romance. which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by mohr as well). that may be the only complaint i have. as soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves paulie on to another.the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. i'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. and paulie's diamond robbery is very mission impossible. he's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since.the story finally comes full circle at the lab, where misha vows to help paulie. of course they do find marie. but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, i was left numb for several minutes. paulie may never get the longevity babe has, but i believe its an equally brilliant film. the same laughs. the same flawless effects. and the same surprising intelligence.a minor gem.

so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? well, think again. paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.the characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.it is journey worth experiencing. don't miss it! it is available on home video.

miike makes a children's adventure film, not unlike the neverending story. it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films. even the worst miike is better than a good many films, though, and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending. it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks. i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it (the dvd includes an english dub), but, like all of miike's films, it can tend to move very slowly. that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness, where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse. the story itself isn't very good, either, and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head. most of what i liked came from the technical side of things. this has to be miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "yokai" are japanese spirits, and they come in all different, fantastical forms, and the costume designers, special effects crew, and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job. i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on (yokai monsters: spook warfare), and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects. i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), agi, who sports dark eye shadow, a tight, white outfit, a white beehive hairdo and a whip. she's played, incidentally, by chiaki kuriyama, whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill: vol. 1. the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki, who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle.

paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and quite fulfilling. i went to this movie expecting to view a typical "family" movie, one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor. my mindframe immediately changed when i was quickly captivated by the movie's wholesomeness. it is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined "wholesome". most are cheaply made, written and produced purely to attract young family members, who'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.oh yes, paulie had a plot. it told the story of a young girl(marie) and her best friend paulie the parrot, who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her. marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health, and quickly tore them apart. we follow paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner, meeting many memorable characters along the way. oh yeah, paulie really could (smart)talk and had a swift new jersey accent. cool. the plot held thick and entertaining throughout, keeping me attracted. paulie is the best family movie i have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. ever. seriously. pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. no sleeping. i promise.

this is absolutely the best none-animated family film i've seen in quite a while, back to the first homeward bound. paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot's pov. it's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films, up to disney status, imho.

i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart. i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all. it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film--we need many more like these!

i was very surprised with this film. i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his "marie" the little girl he was separated from. the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do. actually i was expecting "paulie wants a cracker" jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference. so if you wish to see a good "animal that talks" film check this one out, much better than dr. dolittle in my opinion. paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well.

i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film, not to mention surprised. i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr. the performance was so finely nuanced, neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger, that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro, not the baby-faced mr. mohr. a very impressive performance, indeed, and it's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky, indie films.

some people might call "paulie" a kids' movie, but i wish to assert that it's more than that. probably more than anything else, this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states - topical given the recent debates. portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor (tony shalhoub) of how he searched america for his original owners, the movie tells several stories. there's the elderly woman (gena rowlands) whom he befriends, then a mexican immigrant (cheech marin), and others.all in all, it's a very well done movie. i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies, but this one is a treat. i certainly recommend it. also starring jay mohr, buddy hackett, bruce davison, hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado.

i'm no fan of newer movies, but this one was a real pleasure to watch. adults and children could watch it together - how unusual! my aunt liked it, too. it had laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a talking parrot. it reminded me of a favourite, the wizard of oz. the hero, paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend, marie. highly recommended.

this is a really heart-warming family movie. it has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it like that) as well (just think about the dog in "how the grinch stole christmas"... it was plain bad training). the paulie story is extremely well done, well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too. not more to say except that this is a great movie!my ratings: story 8.5/10, acting 7.5/10, animals+fx 8.5/10, cinematography 8/10.my overall rating: 8/10 - big family movie and very worth watching!

i have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me, i cannot understand why some people compare this to babe. this film is not about the secret life of all animals who secretly can talk. instead, it is about a parrot who learns to talk to help his owner, a little girl with a serious stammer, overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on. then the great journey begins. paulie the parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend, marie.along the way, he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people. he falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her. he gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him.he recounts his tale to a sympathetic janitor in the lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved marie.tony shaloub shines as the kindly janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little paulie despite the risks. jay mohr plays the voice of the parrot and one of the seedy characters he comes across.there is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too. it is a witty, clever, epic animal-adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and his little girl. he search for marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don;t know much about parrots.kids who have seen the wild green parrot tribes in los angeles and pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. all children everywhere, will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.so no babe here, more of an incredible journey with a twist.enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts.

something about "paulie" touched my heart as few movies do. it is a witty, funny yet emotional movie. i'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. i didn't see "paulie" until may, 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay.the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb. my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands (ivy's) company followed by cheech marin (ignacio). tony shalhoub (misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human. you root for him all the way through the movie.you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!!

now, i have seen a lot of movies in my day, but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me. and i'm a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. this is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (for which you won't even be caring about as you watch the movie. trust me, bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids.here's basically what this movie made me to. it one, made me laugh...a lot, two, made me feel for the characters like you're suppose to, and three, it's a very uplifting story. by the end of this movie you will feel good. sure, what anime out there hasn't featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil. it's a formula that is used a lot. but, in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you'd see 5 years ago, the appearance of it is not to be judged. it's very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to. if you however try comparing this to other movies like "the never-ending story" or whatever it will diverse your opinion. watch it as it is and you will enjoy it.it has been a good long while since i've been impressed like this. the only other movie where i have gotten this feeling is when i saw tmnt way back when it came out. there is something about this movie i felt about tmnt that really made me love it. so don't over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.

somehow, this movie manages to be invigorating, bittersweet, and heartwarming at the same time. stars like tony shalhoub (from providence) bring the tale to life. the story itself is inspiring. we see a desperate, up-and-down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable: a bird's.paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by hallie eisenberg, also known as the pepsi girl) with a speech impediment. while she learns to speak correctly, so does paulie. however, unlike most birds, he can speak and understand everything being said. the military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, ivy. she teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find paulie's owner. the movie continues with several twists of fate, until paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement, and found by a russian custodian, who is touched by the bird's story. the plot is in keeping with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift, and a curse. i would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding. a beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. the sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more. and, as a final remark, the puppetry is entirely believable. (unlike in star wars, where yoda resembles a muppet) this film is one of my favorite movies, with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently. overall, i give this movie **** out of four stars, two thumbs up, and a big hug.

this film is a bit reminiscent of the german film, the neverending story because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero. however, due to far superior modern technology, puppets and cgi are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world--one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope.i enjoyed this film, but boy was it a chore at first! unfortunately, for most westerners, this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd. however, give it a chance. don't think or try to understand everything you see--just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film.in many ways, this is exactly the sort of advice i'd give to adults who watch miyazaki's spirited away because it is very similar and features tons of yokai (japanese mythical spirits). the big differences between the two is that the great yokai war is live-action and spirited away is much more child-friendly. while i do think the great yokai war was intended mostly as a kids' movie, in the usa, most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it's so violent, scary and features some adult behaviors. so who is the audience in the west? well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-western themes and composition. this is a rather narrow audience, indeed! while you are watching, look for all the strange little touches. in fact, you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time. a few of the funny references i liked were the comment about gamera, the scene that came with the comment "kids: don't try this at home" as well as the use of kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the yokai (hmm,...perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning)! by the way, director takashi miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically, other than to say that none of his stories i've seen have seemed "normal". some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and i hated them (especially audition and ichi the killer)whereas some of them are magical and among the best films i've ever seen (the happiness of the katakuris). one thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other.

wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through. while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments. the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero, with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein. and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant. as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films, only instead of over the top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure. f'n rad, and one of miike's best!

one of director miike takashi's very best. it's so good it's difficult to put into words. at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end.it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those films weren't afraid to scare - there's a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what i grew up on. the film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions. you name it, it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (go-go yubari from kill bill vol. 1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to. but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth.one of the imdb reviews begins "where was this film when i was a kid?" and it's a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly. even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadn't grown up on it; that it wasn't a part of my childhood like labyrinth, masters of the universe and, to a much lesser extent, the neverending story. those films, and others like the goonies are recalled but never copied - miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things.poor cgi is a staple of many of his films, sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way. here the cgi is mostly average, solely due to budgetary limitations, but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle. the cg effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters (and characterisation) that frequently borders on the visionary.this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made. not for younger or more sensitive kids though.just jaw-droppingly wonderful. see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them. let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't.

also known as the big spook war. the great yokai war is miike's attempt at a family film and damn fine job he does as well. the problem is that i can't imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie. the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery, neverending story and return to oz spring to mind, but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far. in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable.the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems. this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is (it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homage).following an incredible introduction for main baddie kato, and his henchwoman agi (a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami), by way of an apocalyptic army raising. the story reverts to normal for a while, but it doesn't take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcerer.the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times, the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichés, but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world. this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie, albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie.the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful, and largely practical, while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imagine.the cast is uniformly excellent, they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits. even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyami.while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory; cute creatures, junior heroes, a thoroughly evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventure, and a telling lack of violence. there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie.the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t-101 sans skin and with added chainsaws. these beasts rip characters to pieces; suck creatures into their blood stained mouths, and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent's nose before indulging in a little patricide.the creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds. the yokai, essentially the heroes, are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokai's flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal. if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle. there is also limb severing, in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood, a fair amount of sexual energy (agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation, while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes), and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for.spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything, complete with beer, crowd surfing and moshing. also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill.end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike's stronger recent films. while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity. in fact this is easily miike's most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly.well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse.

takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. even as a kid, i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers. he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. but a self-possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. i thought it was a great film. highly recommended.

where was this film when i was a kid? after his parents split up tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather. tadashi's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone. grandfather is only "here" every third day. moms never really home. the kids always are picking on the poor kid. during a village festival tadashi is chosen the "kirin rider" or spiritual champion of the peace and justice. little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world.okay that was the easy part. now comes the hard part, trying to explain the film.this is a great kids film. no this is a great film,flawed, (very flawed?) but a great film none the less. it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero. watching it i felt i was reading a great book, and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book. i loved that the film does not follow a normal path. things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication, one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep. there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it (which is typical miike) certainly its a takashi miike film. that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching, scary and funny all at the same time. no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time, or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next. i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful, that doesn't shy away from being scary, i mean really scary, especially for kids. this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is. this a dark grimms tale with humor. my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world, then i realized who was making the movie. hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images.its also operating on more than one level. the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind's discarded junk. its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters.one of the yokai (spirits) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed. you also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do. its a wild concept, but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level. (there are a good many riffs and references to other movies,tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them, though many parents will) and of course there are the monsters. they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between. frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen. its way cool and it works. one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal, it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on tadashi's head. (acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird japanese monsters) i mentioned flaws, and there are a few. the effects are uneven, some of the sudden turns are a bit odd (even if understandable) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film.. none of them truly hurt the film over all, however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie.i really loved this movie. i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time. (where's the english dub?).see this movie. its a great trip. (besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex)

billed as takashi miike's "first family film" - by people who haven't seen zebraman, presumably. yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness, diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware. the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done, with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures (the yokai). perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors, but i think it's probably just that he wanted to do something different. he's really never been a one-trick pony, but often gets accused of it - perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics. regardless, it's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into.there's a very cartoonish feel to the production, evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places. the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales, which certainly influenced miyazaki as well (particularly spirited away). it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with, so the special effects aren't going to be seamless hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious. some of the special effects are great though, with some very well animated creatures (a mix of cg, stop-motion and puppetry). i think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was *meant* to look really cheap, and is all the cuter for it :) the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting, but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent (i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films!). chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece, though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared river princess - yum yum! those looking for another violent, perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they're looking for in yokai, but if you're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit, there's plenty to satisfy here. and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you've got :)

"the big goodbye" introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case captain picard posing as private investigator dixon hill. this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern, repeated several times on tng as well as ds 9 and voyager. after entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck's safety program). this concept is used to expand star trek's possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix. picard's dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead (see for example chandler's marlowe stories or polanski's all time classic "chinatown"). star trek never focuses on the story (mostly it's a simple "how-do-we-get-out-of-here" scenario) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters. those holodeck "games" are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound (but did star trek ever had a technical, scientific point to it, i mean besides some utopic concepts?)."the big goodbye" shows a relaxed patrick stewart, a mcfadden that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode (at least the early ones) and data has some great scenes, too (although i find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him, for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs). wesley continues turning peaceful trekkies into potential murderers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off?) but all in all this one's fun...

this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world. the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them. a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins. the settings are superb and almost movie like. alas, the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it's safety devices stop working. picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous. picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada. this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there

this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard, beverly, data, and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930's san francisco setting. this episode is an homage to raymond chandler's "maltese falcon" where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat. the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey's "maltese falcon." this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high-pitched buzzing sound. communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. the best part of this episode, though, is the appearance of the famous hollywood b-actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock. he was such a handsome man back in the 1940's. oh, well...

i love cartoons. they can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. they can push the boundaries of satire ('the simpsons'), good taste ('south park'), spectacle ('aladdin'), or reality ('toy story'). there are some good examples of this in 'ice age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth, sid, an idiotic sloth, and diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. on the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. also popping up throughout the journey is scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. his opening scene is a classic.it's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. there is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred's eyes.not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.7/10

a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: a space odyssey. miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. you've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. the movie traces two characters, a mammoth named manfred (ray romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (john leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. they are joined by a saber tiger named diego (denis leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end. there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek. characters contemplate on why they're in the ice age, while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era. some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `all the great guys are never around. the sensitive ones get eaten.' throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating.' the vocal talents of romano, leguizamo and leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. there is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties. the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic.

*may contain spoilers* *may contain spoilers*in the age of shrek(the movie) & pixar(the studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. it put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together(not to mentioned, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father). they begin as enemies and end as best friend. if this sound like a disney film, it is(only made through 20th century fox). the trailer to the movie was one of the best i've seen in ages, but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set. the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film. yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children. the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something else than them. the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film. children will love this film, adults will only like it.

there are very few movies that are so funny as this one. i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater "reserved" for movie buffs like me, so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes...at times the story was a bit "slow", but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles (i nearly fell out of the seat...) was most welcome.

i am not going to lie, this is a great movie. i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre. i saw it a second time, and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes. sid (the sloth) is not all that flattering, but diego (a mountain lion, i think) is really good in the movie. the animation is outstanding, and the story has a touching ending. it is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring. also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting. like i said, it is a pretty good movie, but i would rate "toy story 2" or "shrek" higher. 8/10

ok, at the beginning it looked like "shrek" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. and the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (manny's past, for example). the premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. as i said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. the real letdown is the animation. this wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. the humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of cgi before. but don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, "ice age" is commendable. and it will gather many fans, i have no doubt. oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.

had fun watching this film.. despite the feeling i got a lot of the time, that this film was almost copying monsters inc. there're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two, the relationship between an animal/monster and a small child, other animals trying to break that relationship, etc. it felt like that pretty much throughout the film, to me.one of the redeeming features though, is scrat :) very very funny character, even if he serves no purpose :)

i looked at this movie with my child eyes, and i wasn't disappointed. the story is well-known, some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal)... and i don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut. this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.briefly : it works, it is funny and it is a "must-see" with your children (they'll like it).

when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film. and when i had, i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied. it was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but i think the great parts where already in the trailers, if you catch my drift. it went very fast and it rolled on, so i was never bored, and i enjoyed watching it. the humor was absolutely great. my first contact with a sloth (..or something like it).

an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, a sloth, and a mammoth, who saved a baby, who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age. the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end. one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby, who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community. the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby. they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth. at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs.

shrek, anyone? well, imagine shrek in the ice age. remember the ending of shrek? of cause you do. now, imagine, that shrek turns into a human, and so does the princess. get it? nice animation, actually, much more of an art work than pixar and disney pictures, which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings. strong one-liners, some social comments that kids won't understand, the good guys win. one thing more: scrat. by the way, how does everybody know his name is scrat? 7/10

no day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. after watching ice age i felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.but it's because i am a big guy now, and i am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). the story is quite simple, and the "actors" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour. even the "evil" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. and the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. and apart from some fights nobody dies (not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoony feeling.the computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. [which means lots of work nevertheless!]there were some gags which made me smile - i accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche. if you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once.

the movie itself was ok for the kids. but i gotta tell ya that scratch, the little squirrel, was the funniest character i've ever seen. he makes the movie all by himself. he's the reason i've just love this movie. congradulations to the crew, it made me laugh out loud and always will!

i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it. my mom likes violent movies, so why did she see it? she rated it just to bring down the rating. so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating. i give it a 6/10

this is my first cg animated film that i've ever seen. usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. not ice age. i wanted to see it the moment i saw the trailer with scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch. the story is basically an animated version of three men and a baby, set 20,000 years in the past. the visuals were great. simply beautiful. it's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visuals. blue sky studios is a company to look out for in the future.

(spoilers??)i wasn't sure what to think of the movie. not too much of a kids film. definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying. but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it.i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had. (even less without the credits) and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature. but alas, they torture him. right until the end of the movie. those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars. but i do recommend the movie. even for a sequel.8/10quality: 9/10 entertainment: 7/10 replayable:7/10

while i loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high.i own the dvd, so don't get me wrong, i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it! it's just that i still think the first scene was the best, and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it.

i wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. that doesn't make it bad, just not something i'd go far.it is a little saccharine, so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this.however, all of that goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on-screen. his time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey, could you stick in a little more squirrel?' every time it's getting intolerably dull. that doesn't save the movie, but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i couldn't stop laughing.'and of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with pixar flicks. of all of their stuff, i'd put this at the bottom...but that isn't in itself bad.

ice age is not only animation of the year (in my eyes) it's also the best animated feature i've ever seen!the teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website. scrat is cool! and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes.the animation is superb. your heart really goes out to the characters in this film. they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. it's hard to say which one really steals the picture.i experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. nothing was forced or over done. the emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997, also a fox production. and before that it was the land before time 1988. all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 

this movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average funny units, but it did not have any parts that were really bad either. the worst part was the voice of sid. his slothy slur was just too much for me. by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk. aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good. there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better. this is a good movie for kids. it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids. this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.

"ice age" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by blue sky studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. we are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named scrat (voiced by chris wedge, and please note: the sound of scrat's screams is the sound of tom's screams from the "tom and jerry" cartoons), a woolly mammoth named manny (voiced by ray romano of "everybody loves raymond"), a sloth named sid (voiced by john leguizamo of "titan a. e."), and a saber toothed tiger named diego (voiced by denis leary of pixar's "a bug's life").the movie opens with scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that, he caused an avalanche. we then see a herd going south for the coming ice age (except for manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). sid comes out of his cave yawning, and saw that his family abandoned him. he then pays toll with some aardvarks. unfortunately, he gets pursued by sylvia (voiced by kirsten johnston of "3rd rock from the sun"), a female orange sloth, who wants sid to go migrating with her. sid eventually teams up with manny, and they became friends.meanwhile, nearby a human tribe, soto (voiced by goran visnjic), an evil saber toothed tiger, wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son, roshan, away from him. in the morning, he, diego, and soto's henchmen, lenny (voiced by alan tudyk), oscar (voiced by diedrich bader), and zeke (voiced by jack black) attacked the tribe, but the leader's wife escaped with roshan and gave him to manny and sid to look after. eventually, diego joins them, and went on a journey to return roshan back to his tribe, who are also looking for him as well. relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? besides manny, sid, diego, scrat, sylvia, and roshan, the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that roshan's tribe are using, and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named jennifer (voiced by jane krakowski), and a skinny female yellow sloth named rachel (voiced by lorri bagley), to whom sid shows them roshan as they relax in a tar pit. incidentally, the two rhinos, carl (voiced by cedric the entertainer of pdi's "madagascar"), and frank (voiced by stephen root of pixar's "finding nemo"), who go after sid for ruining their meal and confront manny on a cliff, are simple minor characters. same went for the dodos, who are using melons as their food supply.the gags in this movie are very funny. for instance, manny talks through his trunk saying, "i'm not going!" when jennifer and rachel are out of the tar pit, sid asks jennifer "what do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens?" jennifer then responds to him, "what do you say if you go jump into the tar pit!?" rachel also then kicks sid in the waist. sylvia sees diego holding sid by the neck with his teeth, then she asks sid if he's holding his breath, tells diego to eat him, and promptly walks off.since "ice age" is not only a success, but it has 2 sequels: the first one was "ice age: the meltdown", which was released in 2006, and the other was "ice age: dawn of the dinosaurs", which is going to be releasing next year. i can hardly die waiting to see what "ice age: dawn of the dinosaurs" will be like.

finally i got to see the infamous "ice age". apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word i can say about it. sure, it's not as glamorous as a disney production(besides, it is fox's 1st attempt at a full length cg movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) i found myself on the verge of tears. but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore. a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen. great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. plus the dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.i honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget pixar's creations) then i don't really mind, at least for now. 9/10

i thought that ice age was an excellent movie! as a woman of 30, with no children, i still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. sid is the best character i have seen in some time, better than bartok in anastasia (although he was really humorous, and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than melman in madagascar. i have seen the movie at least 15 times (i own it obviously) and i quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). my favourite scene is the part where sid says "oh, oh, oh, i love this game!" and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers"..."pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..." or however that part goes! that is the funniest part about the whole movie, although i also really enjoyed the humour behind "putting sloths on the map" and many other parts as well. the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is "brother bear".

i watched 'ice age'in the movie theater and i liked the movie. spite of the fact that 'ice age'has many flaws and scientific errors,like humans,sabers,dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period, and even the location of where the story passes(looks north america,but has some characteristics from iceland for example) we can have fun even so.(unless you are very severe!) the planet is entering an ice age, and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer. sid is a stupid sloth that is left behind by his own family, that can't stand him any longer.walking in his way, he meets manfred,or how he calls '' manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north. worried that he can easily be captured, sid decides to follow manfred, and in the middle of their journey, they found a human mother with her baby. the mother dies but manfred and sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans. diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp. what manfred and sid does not know, is that diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food. what will happen, will depend of diego's behavior and conscience...aka "a era do gelo" - brazil

i saw the movie with two grown children. although it was not as clever as shrek, i thought it was rather good. in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it. there parents also seemed engaged. the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. as such, it was successful although i liked it too. personally i liked the scrat!!

just saw ice age, a very funny and especially nice looking film. the story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.more inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour. sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality. including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.

i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out, back in '02. i was only 13 at the time, but even then i liked it. it had some sort of warmth.we've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3d animations made at the time - the characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. they are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. as well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. there are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.all in all, ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before shrek 2 and the incredibles came out.

this is obviously aimed at the same market as monsters inc and shrek, but is different in its less cartoony feel (despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures). the story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end (its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different "animals." you know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in. the characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most disney movies. they are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. the group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. you will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think. the animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. you will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts. i came out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the sloth toy, only to be disappointed the next day when i couldn't find anything vaguely related.which, strangely, makes the movie all the more pure. better than monsters inc or shrek.

i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen. i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.a gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. the opening 3-4-minute scene with "scat," is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. "sid" the sloth (voiced by john leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.ray romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while denis leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tigerthis isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.if more animated movies were this good, i'd own more.

with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job.they have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of ray romano, john leguizamo and dennis leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!david newman -- yet another member of the newman family of hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.the overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. the individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of ray romano's manfred' being a particular treat.the entire sequence with the dodos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `dumb as a dodo comes from.'this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home.

return to the lost world was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of the lost world.in this sequel, the same five people, lead by challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land. gomez has something to do with this. they manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, much to the delight of the natives.like in the lost world, what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t-rex and ankylosaurus.john ryhs-davies and david warner reprise their roles as challenger and summerlee and three of the other actors are also back.despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs, i enjoyed return to the lost world.rating: 3 stars out of 5.

once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world. the five members of the first expedition return (see the lost world, 1992, for a list of actors). a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau. instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world. the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition. although the situation looks hopeless.... (i'm not going to tell you the ending).

this film was excellent, i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. this one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)

this is definitely an appropriate update for the original, except that "party on the left is now party on the right." like the original, this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty. it is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over-zealous, and over-powerful federal government. kowalski serves as a metaphor for waco and ruby ridge, where the us government, with the cooperation of the mainstream media, threw around words like "white supremacist" and "right wing extremists as well as trumped-up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its' citizens rights, with the willing acquiescence of the general populace. that message is so non-pc, i am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the federal government via the irs down on the makers like they did to juanita broderick, katherine prudhomme, the western journalism center, and countless others who dared to speak out. "live free or die" is the motto on jason priestly's hat as he brilliantly portrays "the voice," and that sums up the dangerous (to some) message of this film.

i really liked this version of 'vanishing point' as opposed to the 1971 version. i found the 1971 version quite boring. if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as i did with the 1971 version) than to me, it is not all that great. of course, this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out. however, i have seen many remakes, where i have liked the original and older one better. i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. in my opinion, i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so "blase".(boring)

sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say breakdown. he's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern. the chases were very good, the part with him beingcornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger. this is better than bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law, few movies had the effects-night vision, cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset. the ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not.

its not as good as the first movie,but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes,on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife,the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion,

sure, it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity, this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it. the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film, and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules. most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock, but then again, it's a tv movie! despite all of the good things, the soundtrack was atrocious. however, it was nice to see tucson, arizona prominently featured in the film.

spoilers through: i really am in the minority on this one but i liked this movie. it's not a classic but it's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride. i definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.perhaps the reason i liked it is because i haven't seen the original.something tells me that with a movie like this it's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus, have little to compare it to. this was not a masterpiece but i did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.there were a few things i liked about it. one was the casting of kowalkski. viggo mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really needed to be excellent and he was. this was a great role for him.another interesting thing about vansishing point was the fact that it's made for television. i had no idea this was the case when watching it. it sure seemed like a major motion picture and i would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.i also found the story to be very absorbing. i'm not one for action movies but i got sucked into this. plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama, mysticism, a love story, quirky people every which way you turned. (i didn't even recognize priestly.) and it was touching. this was not a great movie but it is watchable.and then there's the ending. it packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. i am not sure how i feel about the ending. the implication was that kowalkski survived and though i'm highly skeptical of how that would be possible, it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that's always in the mix when making a movie.so i'd have to say i found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which i don't usually like but for some reason, is almost forgivable in this movie. admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical?) but the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. however, having said that, i will admit i can understand why someone who's a major fan of the original would hate this version because, though i have not seen the original, i have seen many original movies i loved being remade with terrible results. (my big dislike is actually sequels.) but i can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.people have compared this to smoky and the bandit. how about a road version of "legends of the fall" meets "thelma and louese" as well? i sure felt touches of both films(both of which i'm a fan of.) i do not think however, that this was a great film. it was better then average to me but far from great. but it was an absorbing, adrenalin fueled, touching movie with excellent casting of the main character. my vote is 7 of 10.

i have to say, i loved vanishing point. i've seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why i gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.as for the car, well the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (and if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged hemi, so it's possible. for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.

to start off with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the rating has to be lowered already. since this version stars viggo mortensen in the lead role of kowalski, it helps.isn't this just like the united states government though, to terrorize one of its own citizens. sounds like jason priestley's character from the movie! but it is the truth, the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife. a wife, who is in labor no less, and may not make it."there was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife." the words of the disc jockey.there were some great shots of scenery in this film, and great car chases and a lot of spirituality. after much consideration, i gave this film a 7.

any movie that shows federal pigs (persons in government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.i saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it. thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk.now, though, i don't remember why.i believe the two should not be compared or even connected.consider them as two different movies.rate them as two different movies.this "vanishing point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government."the voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire: "live free or die." at one time it would have been the motto of most americans.despite its obvious flaws, "vanishing point" is a film to cheer.
