as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.the bad - i'm a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.the dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage-mouth. from what i read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that's too bad. you can tell things aren't right with the story. i couldn't get "involved" with treat williams' portrayal of cooper, either. he should have been fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie. it's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of "folk hero," but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy, too.not everything was disappointing. i can't complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests of oregon to the desert in arizona.i'd like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.

i can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'there's something about mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. sure, cameron diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. ben stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.not once were any of the scenes believable. the shots were badly timed and poorly framed. the farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. i check imdb to see what they are working on just so i know what to avoid.2/10; the bonus is from the one time i smiled. it's not like i'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. my wife hated it, too. the next day we saw 'rush hour' and laughed ourselves silly. this movie just stunk.

to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite. i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing. it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "blow up" or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act. i am glad a show like this came on the air. there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name.

if there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become, this one would take the prize. the plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world. just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be?  the acting was bad at best. casper van dien wasted his talent doing this film. michael york's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film, and did a good job.  this plot was sickening and very disturbing. no tender or immature minds should see this film. this is how a basic good vs. evil plot can go astray. there must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles, who look for ways to market this type of junk. there must have been something censored out to get a pg-13 rating, but it was still awful.

i didn't know what to expect from the film. well, now i know. this was a truly awful film. the screenplay, directing and acting were equally bad. the story was silly and stupid. the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film, but he didn't. i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. where was the focus to the film? where was anything in this film? christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. it was shabbily done and a waste of my money. do not see this film.

yes i admit i cried during this movie. it was so incredibly disappointing, that i couldn't help myself but cry. tbn (trinity broadcasting network) has done it again. first with having the million dollar man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program, and now this.the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies. it was quite amusing, yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. the movie follows what is known as "the bible code" rather than following actual biblical scripture. this film is extremely poorly made; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting. its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie. it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie.i highly recommend you do not watch this movie, even if your life depended on it.

come on tina fey you can do better then this. as soon as the movie started i knew how it would end. sure it was funny at times. even laugh out loud funny. but there isn't enough laughs to save this movie. i don't recommend buying this. at the most i recommend renting it but thats all. baby mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for.tina fey and amy poalher made a good team. mean girls is one of my favorite movies. tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that and they do good in this. but this isn't there best. baby mama had a great supporting cast. dane cook, sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the casts greatness.another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world. after the great knocked up and juno, baby mama looks very average when compared. knocked up and juno are hilarious, heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. baby mama's ending was unfunny and dull.baby mama wasn't the best comedy of the year and it doesn't try to be. i recommend it but don't expect it to be totally hilarious. expect a average comedy that doesn't give the big emotional ending it tries to have. i give baby mama.....4/10

i wouldn't say this totally sucked, but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house. steve martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat. he's just not funny. he's another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie. the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original. amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately. the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes. the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant. the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simple simmer along, not really entertaining or creating laughs.

i saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless. an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? the victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man. they drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or,duh, burn him. quentin alias mr. fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of leave it to beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. wow, love plot. the rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid. the egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film. where is the mummy? really just a curse unleashed. this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least.watch this movie if you need sleep, because you will dose off.

an expedition led by hunky captain storm (mark dana) travels to the valley of the kings in cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. they meet beautiful mysterious simira (ziva rodann) who joins them. they soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy...and only simira seems to know what's going on.a real snoozer. i caught this on late night tv when i was about 10. it put me to sleep! seeing it again all these years later i can see why. it's slow-moving, the mummy doesn't even show up until 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), the acting ranges from bad (dana) to real bad (george n. neise) and there's no violence or blood to be found. this movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics (involving a silly love triangle) than horror.this rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there's some good acting from diane brewster, it's short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) aren't bad. they're not scary just mildly creepy. still, this movie is pretty bad. a sure fire cure for insomnia.

**spoilers*** slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the valley of the kings in egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population, who are at the time revolting against british rule, from finding out about it.given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors british capt. storm, mark dana, together with a couple of british soldiers and mrs. sylvia quentin, diane brewster, the wife of the head man at the dig robert quentin, george n. neise, make their way to the unearthed mummy's tomb. on the way there capt. storm sylvia and his men run into this desert-like princess simira, ziva rodann.simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life, she doesn't drink water or get tired, but also knows just what capt. storm & co. are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig, pharaoh's ra ha tet tomb, as possible.at ra ha tet's burial chamber robert quentin and his crew of archeologist's together with his egyptin guide simira's brother numar, alvaro guillot,already opened his tomb before capt. storm can get there to stop them. quentin violated ra ha tet's body by having dr. farrady, guy prescott, cut his bandages. this action on robert's and dr. farrady's part has numar faint dead in his tracks. it later turns out that numar somehow was possessed by ra ha tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age, at the rate of 500 years per hour, to become himself a 3,000 year-old mummy.the movie has numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around ra ha tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive, like a vampire, of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with. this blood-sucking adventure by numar, with him later losing his right arm, goes on for some time until the by now crazed quentin trying to find the entrance, you in fact thought that he already found it, to ra ha tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide.we learn at the end of the movie that numar, to absolutely no one's surprise, is actually ra ha tet reincarnated into another, some 3,000 years later, person or life. numar's sister the mysterious and sexy simira is not only ra ha tet's sister, since him and numar are really one and the same person, but also the egyptian cat goddess babesti! also not that hard to figure out.with numar/ra ha tet back in his tomb and all the deaths, due the the pharaoh's curse, now at an end capt. storm sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late robert quentin's archaeological expedition trek their way back to cairo and modern, this in 1902, civilization. the survivors of pharaoh ra ha tet curse keep what they found, and unearthed, only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway.

the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. one by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.to be as brief as possible, pharaoh's curse is quite the lackluster affair. while the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. to make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but pharaoh's curse tests even my patients. the cast helps very little. with only one exception (ziva rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. finally, i don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's a laughable, ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse, i'm going to rate it a 4/10. not a good rating to be sure, but generous given all the problems i have with the movie.

this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad... hence, can i advice anyone to watch it? well, i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition (i still can't believe it won)..and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q&a section..but that was also anything but interesting.. what's it about? well the first half (the worth watching one) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official..the first two lie about their professions..but the third is the actual liar.. the second half (do something else..don't ruin a good evening) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking.. but maybe you will see it completely different...the tiff jury did (were they drinking vodka ?)

as much as i dislike saying 'me too' in response to other comments - it's completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90.having been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable. just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible.worse yet, in addition to no discernible plot (other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people, even very old women, drink lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of rolaids.as for spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i tried.don't waste your time or money, and don't confuse this with good russian cinema.

i agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good, and get's you wandering about what is to come....... which is nothing. all open story lines remain open; two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture, save for 1 or 2 very short scenes. i wander if ilya wouldn't have done better to just completely leave them out.... as for the one remaining character, nothing is done with her either. she just visits some god-awful place, and suddenly the movie isn't about her anymore, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread, drinking homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling, like the judges of the iffr, but for me it is just bad taste, bad camera-work, a lousy script and frightfully bad direction. therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading: 1!

the film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. it starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good, funny story is to come. well, i can tell you it will not come. it will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness. in an interview i heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience. i was amazed to hear that. am i living in the same world he lives in? ok a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all, but that doesn't make me feel like i am losing my identity. what does khrzhanosvky think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? am i shortsighted or is he?well my vote: the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.

the worst movie i have seen in quite a while. interesting first half with some engaging, terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar. the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock (read disgust) without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else.i wanted to walk out, but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect. still, time is precious (as the director himself observed in his intro) and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this one.saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female lead.

let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more (most!)open-minded movie-viewers...movies are my passion, and i am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place...i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there, and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-area...i love to rent strange stuff, and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place.he told me he thought i had to see this, and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky(one of my favorites!)atmosphere, i rented it.the vote i gave here is not really fair, because i did not think it was awful, i just did not know how to rate it otherwise. a question mark would have been more appropriate...this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach: i actually felt physically ill! am i the only one whose stomach literally turned? still i did not want to turn it off, or maybe i just couldn't because i was fascinated in a nasty way...i do not ever wanna see this movie again.not awful,a 1 as i said.just not my cup of tea(or wodka for that matter)...

film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar. ok. they're talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time, with no reason. still ok.from time to time, they even make you laugh. interesting. first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it! but then...things become worse...nothing's happening...for a long time...and then, when something happen, all you can see are naked old "ladies" touching each other! not ok. disgusting! by the way, this part should be the top of the movie, but it's everything except that! movie has no point,it's boring, and sick! the strangest thing is that here(belgrade, serbia) on fest (film festival), this movie was the most popular according to researches, of course, before people watched it! i even thought(before watching): "hay, this might be interesting, although it's a russian movie"! but, god, no!!!!

the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend. there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. the core of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. apparently, the movie is unedited. the prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the russian landscape. the village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones. don't go to this movie unless you're fluent in russian.

the russian movie, "4," follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. one is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl."4," i gather, is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it. there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here.despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, "4" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.

i'm starting to think that there's a conspiracy, all right: one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film, despite its obscurity, will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a "universal acclaim" or something within that range, thus ensuring unsuspecting folk (like me) will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing, expecting a surprise, only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck.this movie is one of them. it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it's rather clear that two things might have happened: either i didn't get the message that is so hidden beneath this film's inner realms as to be impossible to access, or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name. 4 is a dirty trick on the audience. it's no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say "smorsgabord" and that despite the rating it got on metacritic, no one had heard of it. it's terrible with sugar on top.firstly, there is the ever-present number four from start to finish. while having a little symbolism here and there is okay, and it's been done with various degrees of success in many well-known movies, this movie is panting with it. four dogs at the start of the movie, looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly, machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt. four people in a bar, although one of them is a non-entity. three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless, not only to each other but to what their lives are not. while this concept may work, the movie meanders so much -- particularly with the story of the would-be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre, and not in a good way -- that the initial theme gets lost in translation. or maybe, like i said before, i just "didn't get it." the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina's story (which revolves on the death of her sister, from bread-chewing, no less, and the subsequent, shrill mourning which follows) that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace. so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own? the director doesn't invest much time in truly tying them together, or weaving a tighter story that could, in a david lynchian way, intersect either with the past-present, or within alternate dimensions, or even as a straightforward, mundane science-fiction story. this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint (or someone into the weird for weird's sake) could endure.

i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood's novel 'the robber bride', and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version. a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. it's fortunate that the movie script fixes ms. atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...heh. okay, you got me. if these guys are mentioned in the book, and i'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, i'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. roz, charis, and toni tell their stories -- to a man. because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them.i liked the characters in the book. it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. i normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and i tried to enjoy the movie as is. if i hadn't read the book, i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. so if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. it's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. it's like zenia's revenge on margaret atwood.

if i had never read the book, i would have said it was a good movie. but i did read the book. who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline. there is so many changes, that it wasn't really worthy of the title. character changes, plot changes, time line changes...first off who was henry and the investigator? they weren't in the story. henry had mitch's persona somewhat, but mitch wasn't a cop. no you made it so roz, helped 'sink ' his body and used that as zenia's blackmail against roz. the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him. her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother. her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story. neither i don't believe was his lover, roz's secretary.tony and west were not together in the beginning. he was actually with zenia first while in college. the black painted apartment was their idea, tony just went to visit. this is where zenia and tony meet, become fast friends. tony hides her love for west. then zenia left west, with cash from tony, then west and tony get together. eventually marry, at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time. only to be heart broken again. then go back to tony. zenia's blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia. now being a professor at college she didn't want to let it get out. i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully.charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. zenia didn't trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive. no she was there when charis had a lover named billy. augusta's father, he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war. eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. zenia and billy have an affair right under charis's nose while taking care of them both. then zenia turns in billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. not with augusta, charis was pregnant with her tho. charis also had a split personality, karen was her real name.zenia did not die from being cut up into piece's.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain. she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she od'd. she was also really dieing of cancer this time around.it didn't show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader. the book was striped down to its bare bones. then re made in someone else's vision. why couldn't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie. it was different enough, and i'm sure could have been made more so.

*warning - no plot spoilers ahead, but movie spoilers nonetheless...* my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. wow - very, very wrong. this movie is an overdone, overwrought, and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! the copyright date on the box said 2005, yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s, and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback, and therefore supposed to look old, but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up, and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different, much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences, shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). thus, this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old, re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. the shell story, shot in 2005, is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the "fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie. don't bother. there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible.

i ended up watching this whole (very long) movie because i was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it. it seems difficult to believe that so many famous people (anthony quinn, lawrence olivier, john gielguld, vittorio de sica, etc.) would have willingly participated in this farce. but maybe in 1968 people really *were* so naive? the plot seems written by some confused latin american marxist priest with an agenda. there is a superpower conflict and the russians are actually the good guys, with the communist party general secretary being a nice and spiritual man, who, suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a siberian gulag. the priest then promptly becomes the pope by a series of coincidences. we are allowed to see the secret vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine.meanwhile, the communists in china achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death. to solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war (in order to justly distribute the western capitalist riches to the poor workers of china).our good old comrade general secretary gets a bit worried and calls the pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace. they meet with the chinese leader comrade peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy. you will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the chinese looked like. comrade peng demands that the western capitalists must pay (which is quite logical after all, don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists?), and that the pope needs to sacrifice something, too, for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice.so when the pope gets crowned in rome, he pledges the entire wealth of the catholic church world-wide to feed our poor chinese brethren in christ. and thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust.apart from this, there are also some minor sub-plots, which, alas, provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. i'd give it three oscars for stupidity.by the way, anthony quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope. he is much more plausible as zorba the greek.

my brother is an avid dvd collector. he took one look at the cover (two models on toilets) and had to add it to his collection. i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie (i use that term loosely) i've felt obligated to sit through. i dared not make eye contact with my brother, quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark duncan who appears in one scene, which the "filmmaker" decided to show every take of (about four total) throughout the movie. in fact, the whole movie pretty much follows this suit. the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock. (i went to bed without viewing it, however). to no surprise at all, i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later.

the underground comedy movie, is possibly the worst train wrecks i've ever seen. luckily i didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was. i love off color comedy. i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained. no, instead the acting was so awful, the "jokes" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was no where to be found. maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so i can't hold that against this movie. it's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat.....by batman...a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat. hilarious. simply genius. i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand. or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the arctic ocean.p.s. don't buy this movie!

sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, this however, wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. some guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high--probably both--and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. he then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals. overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal i couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before i turned it off. it makes you got served look like citizen kane. bat man? wtf...some guy that walks around with a bat, real original. almost as good as calling him fat man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit.

sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one. you can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back. i will now look at michael clarke duncan with apprehension...why....he lent his name to this vermin.

anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. it looked like it could be funny, but i wasn't about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster.about a year and a half later, i was at tower records and in the "dvds for less than $20" pile, there was a copy of this movie. seeing that the dvd was only $6.99 i decided to buy it. i got home, put the disc in the dvd player, and waited for the laughs to start...and i waited some more. the laughs never came.i'd have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible. sick, desperately tasteless, and poorly written and directed, the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time. no stars.

the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i've ever seen. i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written on it... meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh.this movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits, bad characters, and worse jokes... from the pathetic bat-man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit, they just aren't funny. the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between - watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince offer's ineptness at comedy.keep the underground comedy movie underground... bury it!

first of all.....what the hell? why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing, offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch. what the crap is funny about a dog being injured, a grandma getting her head knocked off...a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom? what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick. anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be allowed to walk the earth. but from what i hear its not even offensive...so...they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage...and they cant even pull that off.

this movie goes beyond just being bad, it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film, (if you can call it that).

imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie. now, imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity. now imagine something 50 times worse.got that?ok, now go see the underground comedy movie. that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen. there were a few cheap laughs...very few. but it was lame. even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too lame to be funny.the only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it. he wasted his money. vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it's not surprise why.

words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is. it is a series of random, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady (really disturbing). the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. also, it is rated nc-17, shunning away the only people that might tolerate it.

i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru...not one laugh in it. ok, maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin. but the rest of it was shockingly un-funny. on top of being void of any laughs the "skits" go on forever! steer clear of this one if you value your time and money. dreadful!!! the worst!!!

hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offend everyone- guess what? it worked, i'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true. curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man. i generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. there is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the "adventures of dickman" scene was sophomoric at best.. color me p***ed. thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. never watch this! for any reason whatsoever. not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. that's saying alot. please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. it's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. but the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. crash and burn....

how do i begin? this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen .it has no redeemable qualities .i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.it failed to get even a single smile on my face.i find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place.i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap. i will leave you with this warning. do not watch this film ,it sucks.

it really impresses me that it got made. the director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality. i can think of no other way itd pass script stage. what i want you to consider is this...while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors. it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying. id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor. i want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to me'. but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you'd have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. so imagine that in script form...and this guy got that green lit. thats impressive isn't it?

this movie shows a row of sketches, which partly pass over into one another. i realized the passing over late in the movie, at first it only irritated me. many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact, using absurdity and obscenity. the attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.my personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie (my god, it hurts in my head every time i call it "movie"): a bold attempt to turn nothing into something great. but it failed. at least the director made something out of nothing. but it isn't something good.many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all. it's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making. no. to correct myself, it's even worse than that. a movie with gags so bad, that they aren't funny at all. it's not even fun to watch the lead-actor, writer and director (all three the same guy by the way) perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies. the movie is too bad for that.

this film stars, among others, "slapchop" vince offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and joey buttafuoco--not exactly names that scream out "quality". and with such uplifting skits as "supermodels taking a dump" (it's exactly what it sounds like), a guy who robs a sperm bank (the "rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar), lots and lots of gay jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions. the skits are painfully unfunny (such as "batman and rhymer"), the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude...and stupid. i truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget.apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by "slap shot" vince against the scientologists. frankly, i wouldn't know who to root for in this case!!! apparently, he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film. no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99% unfunny (by comparison, ebola is funnier)...and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie.by the way, that is bobby lee (from "mad tv") wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film. it's amazing his career could overcome this.

lately they have been trying to hock this film late-night on cable tv commercials. don't believe the hype. i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres. this is, in my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, just behind mac & me (#1 worst), and jack frost (#2 worst), but i must admit, they are all close and all terrible! really, nothing of this movie is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money. the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy. i'm not lying about that. someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film. it is that awful. if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this, which i doubt you can finish. two thumbs enthusiastically down.

i bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. i was actually really looking forward to watching this. my god where did i go wrong? now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! with that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen. i tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny. it had no point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid. god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny? this is going right to the bottom of the bin...

i rated this movie as awful (1). after watching the trailer, i thought this movie could be pretty cool. "guaranteed to offend...everyone!" the trailer said. well...it did offend me, because this movie really sucks. it is hardly a comedy, as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie. and what's with all the gays in this movie? i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? i guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that.so my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times, you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy's. it really is total crap.

this movie doesn't even deserve a one. this was an utter waste of time. it was a waste of film and money. it was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting. my spoiler is one that i think should be read by everyone. there is full frontal nudity and disgusting language. but not only that, there is no plot line, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are small time and i was even excited to watch this movie! the only reason i rented it was for brian van holt (who got only a fifteen second part, by the way). i think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only a new sentence.a film similar to this is eraser head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence. there is no plot line, and is not funny. although it isn't trying to be funny. do not watch either movie.

the deadly wake is the perfect movie for film students... to learn how not to make a film!let's see... what did the crew mess up in this flick? worst music mix worst editing worst script worst all-time directing worst acting worst choreography worst cinematography worst props worst sets worst lighting etc. let's face it, if this "film" had been in ultra-high contrast black-and-white, and silent... it still would have been awful. all scenes are dark (lighting people call it "black"), often, the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs, which was ok because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect. the "evil" robot was hilarious... what was that? jazz dancing? oh... i guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something. i'm sure it struck fear into the hearts... of the poor editors. and, how do you edit so much footage of garbage? not possible. garbage is garbage, no matter how you splice it. how did anyone ever get this thru the dailys???bottom line is- i couldn't stand to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad... but i did see the whole thing (with lotsa breaks) just to see if it had any good parts in it at all. nope! none!a perfect example of how not to make a flick... a must see for every serious film student!!!

this is one of those "so bad it is good" films that you always hear about but never see! unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy (and i am not amused) this one is 100% pure serious.however with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining.watcheable enough because of that.

i find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom, american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers, messiah of evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off.the premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. it doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror.the surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great elisha cook jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino.part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with messiah of evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - wrap scene' blur hopelessly.take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary. while we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, messiah of evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. the origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'dark stranger' who came from the woods one day. in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by a good number of years (you can hear the mst3k line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater.i generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. when the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks. the general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. add to that the choppy editing, average acting and hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and i'd file messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

i just watched this movie in high definition on television. i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. and my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. he was a great man. but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that i found it insulting.first of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film. further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. what? they couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee? at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am.figure that out.

i was so disappointed in this movie. i don't know much about the true story, so i was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history. with such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination. well, somewhere the screenplay failed them. it was so scattered - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? i'm sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story, but this movie wasn't it. i was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. other small gripes: 1. the heavy-handed soundtrack. it's the seventies - we get it already! 2. if he's such a phenomenal public speaker, why weren't we treated to more than a snippet here and there - and even then mostly in montages?

what about dahmer's childhood?- the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? what about "infinity land"? - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. what about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? his feelings of neglect when his brother was born? what about his fascination with insects and animals? how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?what about focusing more on his cannibalism? and what about his parent's divorce? these are all things that should have been included in the film. instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer.why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people? he could have made this point many times, particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them (which actually took place in a health club, not a night club). instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes (or however long), but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet? (known as rodney in this film). my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character, to try and make us fear for or empathise with him, but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer, so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else? if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough, but it wasn't. the scene in which he kills steven hicks, his first victim, is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing, and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life. unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing, or that he didn't kill again for nine years. we assume, because his hair style is different, and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback, but to when? and why? what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career?-one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations..some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal, but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth, it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed. why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued?finally, a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate, not a 15. we needed to see his perversion in more depth, to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us. that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance, but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed, and what his modus operandi was when actually killing. anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people. he actually killed seventeen men.aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film isn't all bad. there is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.

one hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame. that was right after hopalong (chris lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. obviously, the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed.if you make it to the end of the film, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did. what exactly was the hook with the gloves? what's up with the rodeo scenario? who was the stranger supposed to represent? why did they make this film? i could probably go on but my energy's been drained. look, there's already a western called "the gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character. watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. that one i can recommend.

the closing song by johnny rivers was the only great thing about this movie. unfortunately that is all the positive i can say about this western movie. i have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western. i am not sure if the movie was a tribute to hopa along, or just a spoof. the hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. not realistic at all. a lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. a previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush. this was not a democratic or republican western. it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. i wonder if it made any money. at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students. if that was the case, then it was a great movie.

i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit. the script and dialogue is laughable. the acting was awful, where did they get them from? music was ok i have to say. luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of.i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league. but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter. i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better, never did.

i'm kinda torn on dark angel. the film appears to be a "loving" tribute to the greatest pin-up to ever live - but there is so little actual "content" that the film itself is virtually pointless. i can't really see what the motivation or "point" of this film is - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so those who don't know much about bettie aren't gonna know much more after watching dark angel either...the film basically chronicles the last few years of bettie's career in bondage modeling. almost the entire film is comprised of "re-enactments" of some of bettie's more "famous" photo-shoots and loops. these re-enactments take up literally 75% of the films run-time, and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person. the film touches briefly on her short-lived legitimate acting pursuits, and her subsequent decision to leave the "business" and become religious - but all of this is pretty much glossed-over in favor of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scenes...dark angel isn't a horrible film - there's just no substance to it. the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots - up-close it's a no-go. the other thing that irritated me, is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits. the film itself is obviously extremely low-budget, but does what it can set and costume-wise within it's limitations - so no gripes from me there. the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved. in fact - the most memorable thing about the whole film for me, was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaw's real name is dukey flyswatter. no joke - check the cast list. can't say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her. and if you are that bad off - then you need to seek treatment anyway...4/10

this movie was bad beyond belief. i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival. before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before, which happened to be its "world premiere." i don't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point. we all understood by the end. its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one. dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige, in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies. the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least. a scene would start going then someone would say "wow you're so great bettie, why don't we make another movie." this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as (and even more boring than) the normal part of the movie. by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up. it was that ludicrous. i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre, but people were not laughing with the movie maker, they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure. this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory. i know movies are expensive. i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen. the movie looks like it was made for $12. the cuts, the graininess, and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience. this movie makes "dude, where's my car?" look like citizen kane. my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured. the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good. apparently, the previous night, the night of the "world premiere" the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie. bettie paige's movies were destroyed. they should destroy this movie too.

the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie's story and re-creations of the klaw short films. while the klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. page richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. and, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie. also of note is some faithful attention to detail. costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. the sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era. it is sometimes surprisingly well lit, and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant, retro feel.

they made me watch this in school and it was terrible. the movie is outdated. the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience.i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.this accounts for cheesy acting very often. also, very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched. i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them. though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, it ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.

in sixth grade, every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester. every class had something to do with this terrible show. we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters. in math we talked about charts and other sea crap. in science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so this wasn't a 100% waste of time). all day everyday was torture. not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well. i could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. i'm still trying to block this out.

i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one. but this film is static. never mind the production value, which is very noble for its budget, but the pacing is deadly. admittedly these folks achieve much with little, but the film fails on the most fundamental level. it's boring. the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls. it should have been 65 minutes. the best thing about the dr. jekyll is mr. hyde who isn't seen nearly enough. he had the most dramatic potential. instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean-brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition. it feels like a backwater stage play committed to video.noble efforts by everyone in the production, but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice. instead it's just a lame retread.

it is so sad. even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake, there's nothing out there & . the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard. i like the brother and sister in this movie. they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like "my friends are going to be so jealous!" hey, whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning? thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this. my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe. the same exact sound for every chop!

as far as i can tell you, in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors, this film is currently available on dvd. i found it only a few weeks ago.it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it. i found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had??? i thought so.this film was indeed well worth 98 cents. 99 cents, i might start to argue with you. but clearly worth 98 cents. and remember that saying about getting what you pay for. for slasher film mavens only.

this movie is a bad to alright rip off of friday the 13th. the movie is about a killer named bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. he kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father, and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother (another f13th take off). the intro is seeing bernie killing his first victims. then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods, soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son. later we learn that his son is bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute. he sets bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on.this movie is only recommended to those who enjoy b grade 80's slashers.

one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams, rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside, causing the material to wash downhill, where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries. the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields, where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. thus, the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner.first, we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor, a very rare treatment in 1938. a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors, with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. then, we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero, to be paired with olivia de havilland. among other things, this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. even the usually colorful gabby hayes, in his small role, seemed unusually subdued. unfortunately, i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. it needed to be more like "the good earth", released just the year before. just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man, such as errol flynn. finally, there is the matter of the inane title. surely, warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. "gold or grain" is short and to the point. incidentally, i understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills', waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining.

as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie. but, what a disappointment! although the acting and the production values aren't bad, the script is awful, the plot is unrealistic, and the theme is disturbing.the main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. i can hardly believe how regressive it is in it's view of women. has the writer been living under a rock? although i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. it's terrible. it's an embarrassment to the city it's named after.

i went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. sadly, that's about all i got. the story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. the sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). worse still was the racism--the shrill jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.

by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing. you know the type....funny but supposed to frighten you.... this was not funny or horrific. the writing was lame...the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness....they were so expected. the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script...at least i hope that wasn't their best..watch this movie at your own risk......i give it negative 3 stars outta 10

pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. this is a horrible film in every way. imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. they would receive a d for this. college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school. since this monstrosity was made by "professionals" i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. i enjoy watching bad movies like "plan 9 from outer space" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. the script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life.

i have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit "dead like me" where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.i felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure. if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather' or perhaps 'beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying "it's a start!"

this is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (i am both). during the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters. as a result, theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors. in many cases, the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. you really can't fault the film makers--they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company. as a result, they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again, no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast! this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry film--starring herb jeffries instead. jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. in each, he sings a little, fights a little (though very poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. believe it or not, jeffries is still alive at age 96.the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west! the problem is that despite its similarities, the low budget shines through. stymie (from the li'l rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in, the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film, there were some odd plot holes, there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful.now this does not mean that the film isn't worth seeing--only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. one reviewer, oddly, scored this film a 10! how this can be with all the problems is beyond me. however, i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. the plot is generally pretty good, the characters likable, the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and it's a very important piece of american history. but a 10!? by the way, in an odd bit of casting, the very tall, lean and almost white-skinned jefferies is paired with short, dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan moreland....as his brother!! also, spencer williams may be familiar to you. he played andy on tv's "amos 'n andy".

how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this? it's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - even the well-known gottfried john is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish.......! the screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie. be careful not to fall asleep while watching! the set is obviously very often a blue screen, f.g. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background...! in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason: different languages of actors - but: other international productions do handle this much more professional. advice: do not watch - it's a diabolic waste of time!

störtebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini-series ever made on this planet.the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: just two examples: visby was shown as a village of three houses. instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by. secondly, hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea. hamburg had no access to the baltic sea, the major town at that time was lübeck.but worse than all that: the directing! how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? impossible! there was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.i can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent.

richard dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? well, he'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler.this william castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of richard dix's life through newsreel a la citizen kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. dix's performance is generally pretty good. but, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.this is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.

let's face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies (just look at the academy award nominations each year). but still, the good ones are truly an art form. look at "when harry met sally", "sleepless in seattle", and classics like "roman holiday" and "it happened one night". i like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness.this movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy. but no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming. modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead. i'm sure as executive producer, he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself. and gershon...i see possibilities of some comedic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. and whose idea was the english accent? pointless.others have stated it, but i want to repeat: this story is poorly conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly miscast; and the characters, well, we just don't give a hoot about them.an art form this ain't. go rent "moonstruck" again.

for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. it was pointless. matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. gina gershon, well, others have said it, but i'll reiterate, why the stupid accent? totally unnecessary. and her acting was just bad. i don't know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. there was no chemistry between these two. and the girl modine was in love with, suddenly she's shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way? where did that come from? i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble, but frankly, i couldn't care less about any of these people.

this is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron. the acting is second rate. poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film. and god help gina gershon. her accent is too over the top. it sounds nothing like an true english woman. it sounds forced and phony, much like her acting. she should stick to what she does best, lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. the other characters are no better. they are two dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. how are we to supposed to care about these people. at one point christy scott cashman get's lost in central park. really? it's not that hard to navigate central park. just follow any path out. not only did i not care about any of the characters,i downright hated them. the only reason i even stayed with this train-wreck of a film was fisher stevens. even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying fish. each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us. the script was awful as was the acting. if you catch this fish throw it back!

the story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, pacing, action sequences, stunts, and use of cg all cheapen and spoil the film.first off, action sequences. they are all quite unexciting. most consist of someone standing up and getting shot, making no attempt to run, fight, dodge, or whatever, even though they have all the time in the world. the sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004.the cg features very nicely rendered and animated effects, but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used.pacing: everything happens too quickly. for example, "elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the start can do back-flips, etc. why is she so acrobatic? none of this is explained in the movie. as lilith, she wouldn't have needed to be able to do back flips - maybe she couldn't, since she had wings.also, we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car, and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car)... "are you okay?" asks the driver "yes, i'm fine" she says, bloodied and disheveled.i watched it all, though, because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting... but in the end, the poor execution made me wish for anything else: blade, vampire hunter d, even that movie with vampires where jackie chan was comic relief, because they managed to suspend my disbelief, but this just made me want to shake the director awake, and give the writer a good talking to.

a good idea, badly implemented. while that could summarize 99% of the scifi channel's movies, it really applies here. i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and i like action movies, and i like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. however, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to bill platt's bad writing and directing.another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. this movie doesn't. it's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words "second draft" are not in bill platt's vocabulary. there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" up front. it also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what *is* that?).if you are a fan of shiri appleby, watch this movie because she's ok. she does manage to break out of her "roswell" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing q back in st:tng, so that's nothing new.in all, i gave this movie a 4/10 rating.

a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. the premise seems simple enough: yentl, a girl interested in studying the talmud, wants to go to school. but only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. she does and becomes close friends with avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass. hadass' family learns avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. yentl, now calling herself anschel, is then selected to marry hadass. she does but it is never consummated. yentl/anschel and avigdor go away for a few days, and yentl/anschel reveals her secret to him. the movie ends with avigdor returning to (and marrying?) hadass, and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. for starters, there is the constant singing. (i can already hear the critics shouting.) yes, i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. the songs become tedious after a while, and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. only one song stands out from the rest, "papa can you hear me". it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really aren't necessary. second, streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced lashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl/anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even hadass, into believing she is a man. yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. there seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, or rather sings, of how she doesn't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. the facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair. nevertheless, in the 1900s, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, or even the country. therefore the "feminine" makeup on streisand does not lend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. thirdly, when yentl/anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand's and only when they learn the "truth" do they become a little wiser. by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for streisand to fuel.lastly, there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, or the songs. to those i must respectfully disagree. while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, i am not a "fan" of her style of singing. however, i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. there are even some songs of hers that i like, so i am not a "hater" nor have set out to bash her. i have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film, she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience.

this movie started out good, i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld. much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny. dan cortese was amazing. i loved him in this role. his agent should show this movie to casting agents. watch the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. i found this in a bin at a video store. it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price.

michael williams, who works for bbc, finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art: a documentary. but since his wife's mysterious death her daughter, emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, jill. and there is a countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named emilia was executed. michael doesn't believe her story, but after that emily has hysterical spasm and jill is killed... this italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by the exorcist, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler,and in a sense, much dirtier. first of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion. for instance, the story shows emily is a reincarnation of emilia. but when emily sees her in the flashbacks, she perceives her exclusively from a third-person's point of view. but if she is the reincarnation of emilia, she should and must see the past from nothing but emilia's point of view. confusions of this kind, which the film has many, are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly, rather than ambivalent, to specify its own quasi-freudian theme, namely, pre-adolescent girl's one-way incestuous wish. to make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem (if not confusion); every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human. regarding emily (or emilia), she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness. (and according to the freudian theory, every girl wants to have her father's child(ren) in her own way. in this sense, emily is not exclusively pathological; only her way of excluding other women from her father's love is problematically pathological. but, as i already mentioned, this film per se is too cowardly to be freudian.) the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is. and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down-to-earth, and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way. in addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable. although stelvio cipriani's music is noteworthily beautiful (indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone), the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b-film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-italian- horror-film-lovers.

i saw this movie, and at times, i was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me.' munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come. re-watch star wars, don't-watch munchie.as a responsible parent (i'm speaking to those who are parents now), i (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. to insinuate munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh.' he is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). he is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. he is the devil's own ron popeil.i pray (i mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd. it is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.munchie also loves pizza. i forgot to mention that. it comes up a lot.

terrible story, poor acting and no humour at all (apart from the final joke at the end)some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home. supposed to be a kiddies movie, but even they will not be amused by this terrible film

i just don't see how a concorde-new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad. it just boggles the mind, doesn't it?well, let's make no mistake about it. "munchie strikes back" is indeed a bad film. munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son. the mom's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. ouch. she can't come up with the money because she just got fired. ok...just is the key word in that sentence. what the...? was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think?munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make! munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was "borrowing" it from. the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times. sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange. hmm.anyway, i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie-anne down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. "munchie strikes back"'s credits promised another film to follow entitled, i believe, "munchie hangs ten". to date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. heh. 1/10

i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like "my girl". "my girl" was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (macaulay culkin as thomas j.) dies. the story was over after the first movie. i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on. that was senseless!

if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. but you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins, too (see my remarks on my girl 1 for the reference).indulgent admission: i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just viewed its predecessor. but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother, my girl 2 made me look, with its theme of searching for mother.put another way, anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2, but relating to a protagonist who asks, like so many adoptees, "who's my mama"? and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe, i'll be sure to make my own movie about it.people are listless. movies should not be listless. my girl 2 (like my girl 1) is just...listless.avoid unless you're a complete sap who's comforted by a series of small annoyances.

here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. i've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies, including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie, and as much as i hate to be redundant, the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. the punch bowl over poor jeremy's head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie (`hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my carrie-rip-off scene. enjoy!'). but that's just a suggestion.(spoilers) the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone, and then they start to get killed. the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. take jason, for example. here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated, he is assumed to carry some significance. besides that, and more importantly, he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine's day cards. it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. sure, i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer, but that's not the point. we know from early on that he is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, he appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. we already know he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him.on the positive side, the killer's true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another rip-off. early in the film, when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel, he makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. but then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. director jamie blanks (who, with all due respect, looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade) mentions being influenced by halloween. this is, of course, completely unnecessary, because it's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer's is that michael's mask was so much more effective and he didn't have a problem with nosebleeds. this stuff is shameless. at the end, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is (complete with slow and drawn out `and-the-killer-is' mask removal), but then we see adam's nose start to bleed as he holds kate, his often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that he's been the killer all along. nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. valentine is not scary (i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember, and even i wasn't scared), and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren't so obvious that they were just going to die. i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews (although the film was in and out of the theater's faster than battlefield earth), but the end result is the same old thing.

***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? it awfully seems so. first of all, this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well. a rejected young nerd who grows up, stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high? can't say you had nothing to work with. but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers. everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike. we know the pattern by now. these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute. let me ask you something: who, in their right mind, is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses? does that make any damn sense at all?"valentine" is only occasionally innovative. one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards' character. she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw. there's some good songs in the soundtrack, including one cool track by orgy. the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd.even the acting is mediocre at best. the actors all sleep through their roles. of course, david boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character on "angel." denise richards is a fine actress, though, and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie."valentine" is just like you'd expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheesy and without a good scare in sight. don't even bother.my score: 4 (out of 10)

went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon 4. unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it. the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks.too cartoonish and very disappointing.

i was very disappointed in this movie. plotwise it was weak bordering on silly: souls who can affect reality in the way they do? a mission apparently critical to the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? and the whole b-story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point i blurted out to the television, "why are you wasting my time with this?"thematically, "river of souls" didn't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode "soul hunter" did. we see that soul hunters can make mistakes, but we still don't get a feeling for their culture. (are there any female soul hunters?)the acting was okay, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive. but overall, i'd say give this one a miss.

i'm a big fan of b5, having caught on only at the end of season three. i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever hit television. even the filler episodes were interesting. the movies, also, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.which brings us to 'river of souls'. naturally, after seeing everything else, i had high expectations. martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci-fi story. the story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. however, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out. had this made the regular season, it would have rated among the worst of the episodes.

before this made for tv movie began, i had relatively low expectations. that's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone. there is no president sheridan, delenn, lennier, londo, vir, g'kar or lyta. if you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except zack, vir and captain lockley left b-5 permanently. now for this film they did bring back garibaldi (who was not in the last b-5 movie) to join zack and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. but because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.the movie is about a soul hunter (martin sheen) who is led to babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (ian mcshane). a lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly i felt like it was a case of "been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past".the secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. this was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.by the way, sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter--with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. however, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. this should have been spotted and corrected.so the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard b-5 nuts (like myself). others seeing it might assume the series sucked--which is a great injustice. this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit.

"grey matter" aka "the brain machine" but the video people thought better of that; the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977; it's that kind of movie. the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be, roughly, a philosopher, a horny priest, a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts. in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies. here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way; my s*** has better production values than this. it held my interest, though, just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing, dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama. the answer: a tract about how science is inferior to god. thanks a lot. it's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle. the priest is played by james "roscoe p. coltrane" best, the philosopher by gerald "the republican simon" mcraney. also featuring very, very, very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity, this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention.

i thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious. this movie went nowhere fast. what could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars, a picture of some dude's swimming pool (he really needs to answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer doing its job, and heuy and louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating "t minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting is going to happen. it doesn't so don't get your hopes up. the best thing about this movie is to see james best and gerald mcc, in something other than there famous tv personalities, and that is stretching to find anything good. and do not get me started on the music which was totally composed of a tympani, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. this movie is as close as i have given a one yet, but it gets the 2 because i actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle. avoid at all costs.

"the brain machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about. four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment. since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general, but it seems he's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. good call there on the senator's part. there's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the general or 'the project'. too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.if nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit. perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - "time warp"; nothing else would make any sense. as for myself, i'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr. krisner's experiment titled 'group stress project'. it applies to the film's actors and viewers alike.keep an eye out just above the general's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.you may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard gerald mcraney fan, could he have ever been that young? james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him father. for something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "the killer shrews". that one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously.

you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles. generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets. such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different titles.its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.its a turkey of the untastey kind. avoid it.

this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. but for me, it failed. i won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.but it didn't work for me. i found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. i don't think that this is the case here.as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "action". and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one.

let's see, here are the "highlights" of the brain machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977. that's an easy one to explain. this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government. after seeing the brain machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!

i bought this (it was only $3, ok?) under the title "grey matter". the novelty of seeing sherriff roscoe in a non-dukesofhazzard role intrigued me. as the other reviewers warned, it's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.and yes, there are plenty of establishing shots, especially of a house with a pool in front of it. some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript i guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who, so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. it's actually kinda funny. after awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel's station identification logo, reminding us that we are watching "grey matter".i also enjoyed two bouts of name-calling. at one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a "scientific b*tch!". it's just a very inadequate insult. several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that "scientific b**tard!". it just sounded very awkward to me.someday this movie will disappear forever. another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it. almost like it never happened.

ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! during the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. figures from then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing. more like dull, pointless and vague. scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway. they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device. perhaps i missed something, but i doubt it. the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities. so basically, "the brain machine" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room. the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings! the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five-second shot of the places. either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci-fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves. staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, i assure you. james best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time. avoid!

oh, my gosh...i thought cbs primetime television shows were theworst things gerald mcraney appeared in...four people are experimented on by a crazed mind controlcomputer. that's it, don't rent it.i saw this under one of its many titles- "grey matter," and it isperhaps one of the worst films of recent memory. the otherreviews are right, it is awful. never have so many establishingshots appeared onscreen, never. the cast is awful, the directionis awful, and the script is awful. i cannot stress how awful this is. avoid it like you would smallpox.this is rated (pg) for physical violence, some gun violence, mildgore, some profanity, and some adult situations

someone mentioned editing. this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. for starters, let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments. why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in? and, what exactly are they testing? apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit. the acting is pretty bad. everyone is emoting. everyone is keeping secrets. they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up. there's a deranged minister who spouts scripture. on and on. but, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors. there are some really cheesy elements. those little rooms and those chaise lounges. the awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). it was interesting, but didn't seem to go anywhere.

dynasty revisited in hawaii... full of clichés, highly predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. if you have nothing better to do however, it does provide 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery. on the other hand, if you are looking for anything more than that, stay away...oh, and by the way, if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one, you have two options: 1. you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or, 2. look at it as science fiction comedy as i did, lie back, relax, and laugh about it!

an absolutely wretched waste of film!! nothing ever happens. no ghosts, hardly any train, no mystery, no interest. the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. everything else is pathetic. the premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place, because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes. what? and the railroad leaves them no place to stay, in a heavy storm? i think not. oh, they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields. umm, yeah. sure. or, they can force themselves on the railroad's hospitality, and stay at the 'haunted' train station. a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring, utterly without ghosts, interest, or plot.so very terribly dull that this seems impossible.this ought to be added to the lost films list !! aargh !!

arthur askey's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public. his juvenile jokes, silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world. a lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him, and he was never completely comfortable in films. he has his moments in the ghost train, and his character, tommy gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.askey's support in the film is not strong, it includes regular co-star richard murdoch; betty jardine and stuart latham as a dopey honeymoon couple; linden travers going over the top as a 'mad woman'. also on board are peter murray-hill, who off-screen married phyllis calvert, as the nominal leading man, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and leading lady carol lynne, who turns in an equally insipid performance. it is left to character actress kathleen harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on dr morland graham's brandy.

"a damsel in distress" is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals. but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments.in "damsel," astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet.this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other.the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance.astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan.but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include:  "i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now" -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street. he does some great "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (in the broadway musical, "crazy for you," harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) "put me to the test" -- fred, george, and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage. george and gracie match fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. "stiff upper lip" (the fun house number) -- at an amusement park fun house, fred, george, and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. it's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times. "things are looking up" -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer. "a foggy day in london town" -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london. at times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself. "nice work if you can get it" -- a great song that is misused in the movie. during a social event at the manor house, fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. each time fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (again, harry groener did a better dance number with this song in "crazy for you.")  "drum dance number" -- as fred and joan are eloping, fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. as usual, it's a great dance number. but there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine. as he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. fred (or rather, a stuntman in fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote. the >>ff button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

this "movie" is more like a music video. kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies, he feels like making music, and when he is making music, he feels like making movies. the best thing in "promise me this" is the music, written by stribor kusturica.kusturica said in the same interview, that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "promise me this" has very little "noise".i liked "life is a miracle". it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "promise me this" has no plot. i was awaiting this movie with big expectations, because i've read, that the script has been written by ranko bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters, who participated also in "life is a miracle". ranko bozic writes great dialogues, but for kusturica they are "noise", and much to my regret, i saw only two dialogues, which i could identify as written by ranko bozic. the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son stribor.gordan mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "time of the gypsies" and "black cat white cat") said in an interview, that kusturica never follows the script. "black cat white cat" was the only script, for which kusturica said, that he will not touch it. according to gordan mihic, after all kusturica comes back to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. and i think this is the case with "promise me this". he should have followed the script of ranko bozic."promise me this" is billed as a "comedy", but there are very few moments, which made me laugh. the comedic moments are in the same style as "black cat white cat", but are not that funny at all. i think the difference comes from the fact, that "black cat white cat" was written by gordan mihic.however, i know some people, who liked "promise me this", they find it very positive movie.

after life is a miracle, i did not expect much. it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell, for instance. zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with black cat, white cat, which i think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. i liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. let's hope his next one will be great.

i did not expect a lot from this movie, after the terrible "life is a miracle". it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "life ...". i have impression that director/writer is just joking with the audience: " let me see how much emptiness can you (audience) sustain". dialogues are empty, ... scenario is minimalistic. in few moments, photography is really nice. few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this "comedy". i've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. if you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco, ... you will find good acting of few legends (miki manojlovic, aleksandar bercek), and very good performance of emir's son stribor kusturica.in short: too bad for such a great director ! emir kusturica is still young and should be making top-rated movies. instead, he chooses to do this low-budget just-for-my-private theater movie, with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans.

not really spoilers in my opinion, but i wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. as the executive producer, morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. he plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman, who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson, ca from brentwood to research his next movie role. why carson, is a mystery to so. cal residents. he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements. paz vega is pretty to watch, a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research. his character is only known as "him" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-"psst, that's 'him,' etc. unfortunately, i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does, then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has. nothing really happens in this movie. i don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. it flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl, without the sexual affair. it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience.

all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie (although you are only allowed at 18). they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it. i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie is. this was one of the worst movies i saw in months. every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. and the end? it's an open ending... why? because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story. this movie is just made to make you scared, and if you are a bit smart and know some about music, you exactly know when you'll be scared. when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told (a bit to loud) him that this was a total waste of money, some stupid kid looked strange at me. these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish, if only i use the right marketing.

imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about "the grudge." so, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. it is the halloween season, after all. and it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, "that can't be the end of the movie...." but, alas, it is. and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. you think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. i see no future for miss gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. horrible, horrible, horrible. the plot didn't make sense; continuity was terrible. it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a "grudge ii--the return of 'cat-boy'."

if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! shame on you, sarah michelle geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in english. i wanted to boo when the movie ended...a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie...she just practiced her frowning skills. don't waste your time or money on this film.

gee, what a crappy movie this was! i cannot understand what people find so scary about "the grudge". the director plays one trick (i'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. to conclude, i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor "the ring" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for "the grudge" is a waste of money.

wow, what a total let down! the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous. the special effects were a direct rip-off of "the ring." the story? was there one? not in my opinion..just a bunch of flashy imaging. the entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. however, this is the worst horror film i have seen in years. and that buffy chick? well, she's a bad actress! as plastic as barbie and just as talented..no, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of barbie! i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg-13, and had it been rated r, it would have bombed imo! stupid movie!

this movie was horrible. i could barely stay awake through it. i would never see this movie again if i were payed to. the so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 i payed to see it. don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie. horrible movie, no need to ever see it.

this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. there are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like "the ring") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.this english-language version of "the grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not really what you ought to be living on.not recommended.

okay, if you've seen the ring, you've basically seen the grudge. it's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. the plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? and it's not really clear what bill pullman's character had to do with anything. he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. it didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more.

my husband and i went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back. i was so disappointed. the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. i found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers, i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us. my advice: if you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.

this movie may seem scary on commercials, but the actual movie was a reason to vomit. this is a below below average, (even lower than that) and has no plot. i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure, a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you, but so what? make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair (dead japanese woman). can you say "horrible rip-off of samara (the ring)"? don't get me started with the "dead child". not even that scary! so what? he has a cat and he can imitate it, big freaking deal! just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge! 1/10! yuck! >.<

ok when i saw the previews for this movie i thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group i was with. now living in america especially during this election i see some very deceiving things but i have to say these previews were towards the top of list. i don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie. i only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one. the whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me. as for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of i thought they were comical at best. oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? the worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning. how does that scare someone? i can make that noise easily. now don't get me wrong i have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but i didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad.

i hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case i feel like i have to: the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. there, i said it. and now that i have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why."when someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. the curse gathers in that place of death. those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury." that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing. unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. those who encounter the "curse" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. you want more? well too bad. some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you. the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. director takashi shimizu, pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. it pretty much unfolds like this:-person walks into house-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard -person goes to investigate-sound starts to get loud-person sees a ghost-loud scream and/or cat screech-cut to blackbefore the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. the first time was actually somewhat creepy. each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. by the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end "with a loud scream and a cut to black." we were never proved wrong.the film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. i have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. i haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander 2. and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?obviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made $15 million its first weekend, the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. the scariest things about the grudge are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the "scariest movie ever made." i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge?

i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he's made on dvd except for hotel room & the 2 hour twin peaks movie. so, when i found out about this, i immediately grabbed it and...and...what is this? it's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. maybe i don't know what's good, but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks, too. let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity. i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this. 2 out of 10.

lynch. the man has some really great stuff! he knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. this, however, is altogether different. dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. i may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward. didn't miss a thing. i felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile.

i'm somewhat of a fan of lynche's work, so i was excited when i found this dvd. unfortunately, i was very let down. it's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor. the animation is very crude, no doubt done using macromedia. each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows. for people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed by it. however, if you've spent much time on newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you've seen before. many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd. if lynch submitted this work to the website, then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists. but, since i saw this on dvd, instead of on newgrounds, i give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as i would have otherwise. these cartoons are fit for the internet, but with a name like david lynch on it, i expected better quality both in story and in animation.

in film, i feel as though it should be more than just art. i think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one. i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. it is good film-making but there really isn't anything else to it. as i've said before, i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don't see a need for it at all. this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. if you like lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.

david lynch's crude and crudely drawn take on south park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families. the father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises, the son and mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.lynch is not famous for his comedies (i.e. on the air, aspects of wild at heart), and i am not particularly fond of comedies in general. however, there were a couple of scenes in dumbland which made me laugh out loud. there are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in dumbland).i believe lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disturbing, animated comedy here. interestingly, he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor (i.e. most will farrell films) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor. while the blend doesn't really work very well here, it is nothing if not lynchian.worth seeing by lynch fans.

let's be honest here: the only reason anyone bought this, the only reason anyone reviewed this, and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch's children. but guess what? even david lynch can produce a piece of crap.maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in-itself as a pure subject-of-knowing. maybe the atrocious, cacophonist sounds, and chicken-scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity's place in the world, about our relation to the real, about the absurdity of it all.instead, it just says one thing to me: i just lost $20.if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive, i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed. if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd, i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes.there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland -- it is meta, meta funny. that is, it is so bad that it isn't even funny because it's so bad. this fact, however, is a little funny.if you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy dumbland. if not, spare yourself the agony.

a vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). released to theaters just prior to "a star is born", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring kris kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. filmed in simi valley, ca, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director george armitage's script. armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including jan-michael vincent, victoria principal, bernadette peters, and, in a bit, loni anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from ****

you wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good, and it isn't. it's a no budget, ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. there is no plot to be seen. the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen. it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. it's a funny and sickening film, and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie.my rating: bomb/****. 90 mins.

a terrible amateur movie director (no, not todd sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave. the friend and sister fall in and get rescued. meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'. whatever the heck that means. this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's.. well bad. the humor is painfully unfunny, the "action" merely sad. now i've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this. only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you. but the rest run away fast!!my grade: f

wow, this was a very bad movie... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result.the editing of this movie was really non-existent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all, has bad acting, bad dialogue, bad everything.the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this.unless you are (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find, do not watch this. period.

and a 30,000$ budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50$. you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. what the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies. it could have been great if he just had of given a care. the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it.what happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and one idiot behind the camera.

ok, i really don't have too much to say about this film, other than this: i have seen over 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of those were horror films. while i have some difficulty deciding which is the best (as opposed to my favourite, which i can tell you is george a. romero's dawn of the dead), i can tell you without the slightest hesitation that todd sheets' zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i have ever seen.there is simply nothing positive i can say about this film. the acting, the dialogue, the directing, the make-up, the music... every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist, please heed my warning and do not waste your time on this garbage. there is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this. you won't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display... trust me. please.

i got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'zombie bloodbath' as one of it's alternative titles. perversely, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! this film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself 'zombie bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display...but it all feels very old and tired, which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line. it's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc. the film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you're in for; low quality zombie garbage. there's plenty of gore in the film, and it's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring. zombie bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! the main influence seemed to be romero's superior day of the dead, although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore. it all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall i can't say i was impressed with it!

i thought "what's new scooby-doo" was pretty bad (yes, i'm sorry to say i didn't like it), since hanna-barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. when i heard "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" was in the works, i thought it could be better. but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear, i knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. i watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just yet another "teen titans" or "loonatics unleashed"-wannabe. no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. shaggy and scooby-doo have become more brave, too. also, since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series, casey kasem (whom actually is a vegetarian), the original voice of shaggy, will not voice shaggy. he will only voice shaggy if he doesn't eat meat, and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise, as if the internet jokes weren't enough. so scott menville (whom previously voiced red herring on "a pup named scooby-doo") voices shaggy here. believe me, the voice is really bad! it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old, and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. however, kasem does voice shaggy's uncle albert, which is a sort of good thing. scooby-doo, on the other hand, does not look that well. he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby-doo from the live-action movies. also, scooby's frank welker voice (need i mention brain the dog again?) still hasn't improved. robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than scrappy-doo! he tries to be funny and does "comical" impressions and gives safety tips ("remember kids, don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!"), but it just doesn't fit into a scooby-doo cartoon. again, the hanna-barbera sound effects are rarely used here. however, on one episode, "lightning strikes twice," they use the "castle thunder" thunderclaps during it, almost extensively! (although they do still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects, too.) scooby-doo hasn't use "castle thunder" sound effects since 1991. but my question is, why use "castle thunder" on "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue," while not use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on "what's new scooby-doo!" (two episodes of wnsd used it, and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) if wnsd and the dtv movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. the day this show premiered, i watched the first episode, and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes! to get my mind off of this poor show, i rented "scooby-doo, pirates ahoy!" which came out around the same time. and you know what? the "pirates ahoy" movie was actually better than "shaggy and scooby-doo get a clue" (and even better than "what's new, scooby-doo!") and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. the direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. but, whether you loved or hated "what's new scooby-doo," i don't recommend it. but if you hate the old series, then you'll love it! (oh god, i hope the old scooby-doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) anyways, like wnsd, a really bad addition to the scooby canon.

as a mother of 2 young children who are or should i say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of scooby i feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of scooby.if as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to shaggy and scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special saturday morning cartoon. but that in essence is the problem it is in it's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" scooby and gang. i'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but i'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost. my 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why wasn't it anything like the last series(where are you).scrappy doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this. let's hope get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers.

i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox

shaggy & scooby-doo get a clue. it's like watching a much-loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness!! clearly the work of people with no soul, no love or respect for the original work. what in the name of all that's holy were they thinking of? it seems they were trying to go all post-modern and ironic. instead it's just abysmal swill!! what's the point in taking up a successful franchise like 'scooby-doo' if you just going to flush it down the toilet? my son loves the original series - and even some of the spin-off movies - but he can't stand this drivel! and let's face it, you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year-old

the animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. i've been a fan of scooby doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. i didn't think much of the scooby doo animated movies, (i'm talking about the tv series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and i like most people found scrappy doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. as soon as i saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and i use that term loosely) speak, i cringed. also, mystery inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. what's new scooby doo was better than this. if you're going to have a scooby doo tv series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. the entire cast of characters, and quality animation. they need to put this one back under the rock from where it came.

rented it last night. the opening(2001) ran waaaaaaaaay too long. the hitchiker scene served no purpose. some skits were just retarded. i knew beforehand, chevy chase was on for less than 2 minutes. no problem. here are the best parts:koko, uranus, babs commercial, curtis mayfield songtotal: 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movieeverything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.let me give you some advice: if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies, rent "kentucky fried movie". if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies, rent "amazon women on the moon" or "uhf"otherwise, don't bother renting this movie. you'll save 2-3 dollars.imho: ken shapiro's best movie is still "modern problems"

after two long, long opening skits, one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free, we start the fast-forward fest that it groove tube proper. naturally, uber-stupid frat boys who still mainline jackass or tom green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube, sex olympics(i really don't need to give you details, do i), and a clown who basically does the "not very endearing clown" bit i think i've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles: well, more power to you.i just want to express that, despite what you've heard, this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like kentucky fried movie or what not. the skit movie had already been done in and now for something completely different, everything you always wanted to know about sex, and so on. and done way better.

straight to the point: "the groove tube" is one of the most unfunny, unclever and downright horrible films ever made. this "comedy" is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it's almost incomprehensible that it was even made. i said almost because there are fans of everything after all.this film isn't even "good" bad or "enjoyable" bad. to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as "plan 9" or "robot monster" would be a crime to those films. films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of. but this film is so bad, so poorly made, acted and scripted and so incredible stale, that there just isn't even a trace of "camp" or "schlock" to be found.even though this was made before saturday night live premiered, comparisons were probably inevitable. i'm not a big fan of snl, but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find. and man, that's bad. just to keep the men viewers from leaving, shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often, but poorly-filmed breasts from 1974 aren't going to excite anyone these days. truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep-inducing excursion, i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either.a man named ken shapiro made this film. i swear to god, any ten-year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever. it's just downright unreal - this is truly an unbelievable film. the "jokes" and "gags" are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad's porno mags out at night won't laugh.i will give this film one thing - the very last sequence, the "dancing man" sequence, where a guy (shapiro) on the streets of nyc dances to a tune, is easily the best thing in this horrible film. not that the "dancing man" sequence is that great either - it definitely has its moments of not being clever as shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song - but it actually was somewhat watchable. the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film. no wonder shapiro put this sequence last - again, while not so great itself, it easily beats anything else in this "film."otherwise, this film is such a complete piece of crap, it's unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless. the name of this film should have been "ken shapiro's craparama." it's amazing that this was made, but many truly talented filmmakers can't get in. however, i will say that i bet the geniuses at nyu would love this movie. total garbage.

this movie was a rather odd viewing experience. the movie is obviously based on a play. now i'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just doesn't feel terribly interesting enough to watch. the movie is way too 'stagey' and they didn't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie. instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play, with over-the-top characters and staged dialog. because of all this the storyline really doesn't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. at first you think its a drama you're watching, with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy, that leans really more toward the comedy genre, rather than the drama genre.the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. sure, the actors are great; peter o'toole and susannah york, amongst others but they don't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough'.the story feels totally disorientated. basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york. but what exactly is the story even about? the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. like i said before; i'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really isn't fitting and simply doesn't work out.the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. more was to expect from director j. lee thompson, who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed, stage-play translated to screen, project.really not worth your time.4/10

contains spoilers. the british director j. lee thompson made some excellent films, notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear', but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings. the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland, and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister hilary, and hilary's estranged husband douglas, who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. we learn that during his career as an army officer, charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre'. this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle. the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum. peter o'toole was, when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia', one of britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and 'country dance' is not one of his better films. he overacts frantically, making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper-class twit of the year' sketch. susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. there is also little in the way of coherent plot, beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide.the main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name. there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part, and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. (the american title for the film was 'brotherly love', but this was not used in britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc?) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10

to die for (1989) was just another d.t.v. feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties. the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in. other than that there's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film. a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l.a. looking for it. will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century?this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed. they're so bad they make this one look like a classic. i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting.not recommended by me because i didn't like it.'nuff said?

having read another review, i thought this movie would actually be good. i do enjoy the "b" movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such. the photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. but the editing left much to be desired. it was very choppy and staccato. whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. the music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. if the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. unfortunately, i've seen better acting in porn flicks. if you want to see a "b" vampire movie, check out 'blood ties'. you'll be much more entertained.

i usually enjoy loretta young's early movies: her acting back then was light and breezy, and she sure knew how to wear clothes. but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell. young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband (paul lukas) into becoming a championship bridge player. it's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.there's one interesting bit though. as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in mid-air, freezing in anticipation of the event. it's the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film. wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny.

this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony, it certainly can't promote winning bridge, so the satire didn't work for me. but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film. it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. at one point he even enumerates "one... two... three... four..." as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. and people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. that spoof worked very well indeed.unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren't given good enough lines; glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film, but she practically disappears thereafter. what a waste of talent!

every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks "what's with snitch'd" ? i know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. you see, i was the cinematographer on the film.let me clarify some points regarding this "interesting life experience".originally, snitch'd was called one hard hit. i met james cahill in july of 1999, a day after i wrapped triangle square, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag's notorious experimental feature contract. but i digress...i though i was on a roll, and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, i took it. after all, clerks, el mariachi... i too believed the myth back then.let's just chalk it up as "film school" for many involved, myself included. snitch'd was shot over two weeks in august, 1999, in aliso viejo and santa ana, ca. cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city ( yes, he is a drama and english teacher...consider that while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast.of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l.a.'s channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of eva longoria, who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt. i must say her professional dedication, focus and "let's do this" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come. snitch'd suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. none of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, i understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch'd. since cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover... as so many have picked up this dvd based on it's sleeve. ----------------- one year later, eva, now on a soap, and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, split second, which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent. 6 years later, i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez, mexico. i though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has never appeared in any festival or venue, although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject, virgin of juarez and border town.

this movie is weak ,the box-cover says east la's toughest gang and it is really santa ana's , james cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough chlo gang . it is fake , boring , senseless and whack , i tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . it was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video-box proclaims . james cahill should act in gay porno .james is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life . the film features eva longoria who is hot but james can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! i felt at times i was watching gay porn and was turned - off by the whole film . james clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again . his martial arts skills are minimal at best , some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .

maybe this isn't fair, because i only made it about halfway through the movie. one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to lameness.the acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. for example - during a coke deal, the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - i'm no expert, but i think people generally put it in a bag.they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's that over the top 'crunching' sound" and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects.worst movie ever.

unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the "nightmare on elm street"-series! part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. this isn't just the worst entry in the "elm street" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! the story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom & jerry cartoon. the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. you'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no there's only one teenage-survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. the john doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! how about that: freddy krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3d-glasses! sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn't it? as far as i'm concerned, "nightmare on elm street" has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. "freddy's dead", however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.

warning: review contains mild spoilersa couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st. series. however, just two years on and i find i can't remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. from what i do recall, some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. but while i cannot recall much of the first five films, i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy's dead.an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. the fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, robert englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. i always thought freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. it's like englund's crying out "we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?" and i'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. was freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? all he gets to do here is a few "haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars" and that's it. if this was the only elm st. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. even as the character pre-death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.acting is almost universally poor. just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. only kananga himself, yaphet kotto, keeps his dignity. and when roseanne, tom arnold and alice cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. the script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. carlos (ricky dean logan) opens a road map, upon which the noel coward-like freddy has wittily written "you're f**ked". when prompted for the map, carlos responds "well the map says we're f**ked". who wrote the screenplay, oscar wilde?or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. oddly, the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. "nice hearing from you, carlos", quips freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. it's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into freddy's world. though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-d finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. tracy (lezlie deane) is the only one who gets to greet freddy with "shut the f**k up, man" and a kick in the scallops. and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? freddy's dead. no laughs. no scares. no interest. no fun.

actually, they don't, but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is. there were some moments that could have been good, but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities, and don't get me started on the bad.the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but i will recap them here in case anyone cares. anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. the first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with freddy's long-lost child. now, the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer (and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is hereditary, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which lisa zane's character dreams of freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? sound like a good plot idea to you? obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca.then there's the trip to springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. the essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show.of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. that, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with freddy's dead: it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.on a related note, i feel kind of sorry for robert englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character. he has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries "v", for example), and to be forever remembered as "the man who played freddy" is selling him rather short. it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. as for the rest of the cast, well, i think their performances here speak for themselves. they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b-grade horror props. even yaphet kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b-films.all in all, freddy's dead gets a 1 out of me. i'd vote lower, but the imdb doesn't allow for that. fd is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.

freddy's dead: the final nightmare, the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel. i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child. i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday, so i got to see all the sequels. may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like freddy lost his edge. it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. this was a sequel that wasn't needed, sorry to robert englund, but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents.freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter. maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. she has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. ironic, isn't it? but freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.freddy's dead: the final nightmare is also presented in 3-d, radical, huh? note the sarcasm. this is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series, i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest. this just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not father knows best.2/10

george brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress. she is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune. he interviews her on her yacht. they fall for each other in bathing costumes.it turns out (quite early) that she is not an heiress. she part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.the movie follows the ups and downs of their romance.the supporting cast does little to buoy it up. davis and brent carry the picture. though it's fairly predictable, it is also fairly entertaining. it's far from her best. but, especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre, it's not one of her worst, either.

this movie stinks. the stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long. i can't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film. whew!

why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. also, there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie. he was uncredited but his list of roles here (imdb) does give him credit. btw... rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. this film is proof that no matter how many big "names" you have. sow's ears don't make silk purses. i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad, sad, sad... maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. it has no endearing, entertaining, or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else.

i'll admit. i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in (unfortunately that includes the horrible films batman and robin, the avengers) and this one.this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen. (yes it ranks even lower than the avengers). everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief. even if you think uma is a goddess like i do, please please don't subject yourself to this movie. you'll hate yourself the following morning for it.

when it comes to movies, i am generally easily entertained and not very critical, but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start. i gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it. what a waste of some great talent! i was very disappointed with this movie, as it was not what i expected.

i´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. i expected something better from uma thurman, which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place. an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. it´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. this movie deserves it.

there are movies like "plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like "waterworld" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like "desperate living" that you hate to admit you love. cowgirls have none of these redemptions. the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what i've been told, the book is enjoyable.how then could this movie be so intolerably bad? to begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations. open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way. finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. he does have twenty years of cutting experience.this movie now defines the basement for me. it is so bad, it isn't even good for being bad.

this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime. cool title, excellent director (i saw "to die for" and "drugstore cowboy" before this), and hey - uma thurman in the cast. how can you go wrong? well, that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this turkey.disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat, this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. its critical lambasting was well deserved. you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality. zero out of ****.

certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by rain joan of arc phoenix (river's sister, inevitably), as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms.

i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix. i thought i would give their sister a try, rain phoenix. i regret checking it out. she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? i have never been so unsatisfied in my life. it was just total rubbish. i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. i thought she was everything but that. those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? whats the point??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. hopefully, rain is better in other films, i forgive her for this one performance, i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film.

i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought "time to watch it". big mistake!a long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. perhaps it would have made more sense if i'd read robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks, take for example pat morita. even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. even when you see it in the "under $5" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge!

there is only one problem with this website, you can't give a negative rating. additionally a mate rated this as a d grade movie. i say he was being too nice. a piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie, and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire. this is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back. after watching 5 minutes, myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining. half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny. it's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more, he should go and buy a rope. and to the actors in this flick, i hope you got paid well to be in this joke because i doubt you will ever work again. in summary i fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence.

forgive me for stating the obvious, but some films are good and some films are bad. of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. films such as the godfather, saving private ryan, and star wars slot comfortably into the good category. at the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name. occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. a film that is more than bad. such a film is maiden voyage.briefly, maiden voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ship's owner. of course, there is an all american hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.this is a production that plumbs new depths. everything about it is bad. the acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breath-takingly poor. in short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.yes, it's that bad.i will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. however, its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what i mean.imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. you are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. what would you do? i don't know about you, but i would throw the bomb as far as i possibly could into the sea. not this guy. he watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. enough said. such a demise would merit a mention in the darwin awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's lives.

the cast of this film contain some of new zealander's better actors, many of who i have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running new zealand soap shortland street. it's as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. imagine "under siege" meets "the love boat", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.if you are an actor, i recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.

van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film, as indeed must every single individual involved. to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish. production values are somewhere between the original series of 'crossroads' and 'prisoner cell block h'. most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. as for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'maiden voyage'. worse still, you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes, because there aren't any. an appallingly dreadful film.

i saw this on tv the other night or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldn't stand watching it any longer. it was bad. really, really bad. not "so bad it's good" just flat out bad. how did it get funded? who thought this was a good idea? an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was "save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @#$%." i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents. the shooting was dullllllllllll. the action was awkward and stilted. the dialog was inane. by far the saddest thing was ship. in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well. instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls, i kid you not, they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. dumb, dumb, dumb. don't watch this movie, not even as a joke.

yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply (and badly) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there? for the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard, under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand! the acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time!) is there any chance of something at least half decently made, semi believable and most important original?!? no, i thought not..

what a poor excuse for new zealnd movie making. i'm ashamed to call myself a new zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv (aug 2006). the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. the ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the usa and mexico. it has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. one of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of new zealand's south island in the background for god's sake! must have been a very cold time on the usa/mexico area! the story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new zealand/american accents just don't work. i expect the new zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. i know high school kids in new zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. goof: there is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a taco company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was american. but some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. i'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.

having the in-laws over for the weekend? then this is the film to hasten their departure, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list. an interesting piece of added amusement is playing "spot the villain" as passengers join the ship. you won't be wrong!!!! with a script that sinks faster than a brick, clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.a must watch film, if only to laugh at how bad it is.

i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that leon was not the right actor for this role. leon was so right as david ruffin in the temptations, but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film. actor miguel núñez who played little richard in "why do fools fall in love?" was a much more suitable choice, having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well. and this is what has happened here. glossed over or missed entirely are lr's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. what "the temptations" did so well in capturing the rise of the group, warts and all, this film misses by a wide mark.what is going on with director robert townsend who started off so well with "the hollywood shuffle"? he's a talented, funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort.

i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic. but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s.

this is not a good movie. it's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where. not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. worst of all, no one bothered to tell lonette mckee she can't sing. but who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking. but i digress, nothing new here. bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens. surprise, surprise. welcome to the music business. i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie. so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies. i don't play that! if you want to support these films by going to see them - great! if you enjoyed it - super! to each his own. but don't try to tell me it was good. pleeeease! i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors. wanna see a good african-american movie? see love jones. ray. or the color purple. those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin. why? because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater. just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film. it's only good -- when it's good. period.

about time they released this movie on dvd. i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the dreamgirls movie. but, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976.i'm very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 dd sound. come on wb, you can do much better then this. the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.seem wb didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales. they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has. would i recommend this dvd for purchase. yes, because it is a classic film. but wb need to go add some more special feature. take notes from other group movies, the five heatbeats, or the temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this dvd.

just in time to capitalize on the long-awaited movie version of "dreamgirls" is the dvd release of this semi-forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the supremes as its inspiration. released five years before the broadway opening of "dreamgirls" and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up-and-coming girl group, and that's where the resemblance basically ends. written by joel schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product ("batman forever", "the phantom of the opera"), this movie seems grittier on the surface. true to form, however, schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye-rolling one-liners. with little affinity for staging musical numbers, sam o'steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget tv-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure.the story follows three harlem sisters - sexy sister, self-righteous delores and sweet sparkle - as they sing in the church choir, meet smooth-talking but well-intentioned boys stix and levi, and then find their first taste of success as a singing group - first as a sweater-wearing quintet called the hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as sister and the sisters. but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group - sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer satin struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie; levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick-up for satin; stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some jewish mobsters for financial help; delores just gets plain fed up; and poor little sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants. a big plus is that r&b great curtis mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs, some catchy and one, "look into your heart", a real winner.the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. lonette mckee's valiant attempt to make sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns, including a sad billie holliday-like turn at the mike. before they hit it big on primetime tv, philip michael thomas and dorian harewood portray stix and levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility. the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-"fame" irene cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role (though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene). the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice-over by dj casey kasem and a bonus cd of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by aretha franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack. it's not a terrible movie, just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as "dreamgirls".

this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family, but unaware of her mother's death. her sister runs the family home, but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband. frannie strongly objects to the idea, and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility.in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love (as you do), and it's from this point that i sort of lost interest....there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary charlie's angel.silk hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not the worst film ever made. the positive aspects are there; you just have to find them.

director fred schepisi(roxanne) directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about albert einstein(matthau) trying to hook his scientific niece(ryan) up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's. to get ryan to like robbins, einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist. the idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. tim robbins, meg ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan.

tim robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein's niece! although he's on-screen much of the time, robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being walter matthau playing einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****

when i first saw this film, i thought it should have come from the children's section - it's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering. i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. this film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn't put me in a very good mood. but if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like i said..it should be in the children's section. einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal meg ryan's heart. a very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie.

i loved dewaere in series noir. his talent is trivialized in "the waltzers" aka "going places". okay, it's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; many folks find such behavior amusing. this was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. i find the smirk on blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior. from the first moment when we see patric dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours. when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in "going places" we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining. i have trouble eking even a "3" for this annoying distraction.

this movie is an abomination, and its making should have been considered a capital crime.one of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. it is a tale of a really gripping mystery, nice old-fashioned romance, and dry english humor. why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant, change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product.

sadly i don't remember the book anymore, but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace. this film represents a typical german production of low quality. it does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. however there's hope ... i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.

this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie. the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful, sophomoric, pseudo-orwellian/huxleyan/whateverian "vision" of "the human future."science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. i think other genres with a high ctgsr (yes, i just made it up, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound "message."sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level, as numerous great filmmakers have proven. but there is an immense downside to the whole concept, which is represented by "robot jox," with its low-rent construction of "the future" (lone good design element: the bizarre, slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully heavy-handed "iliad" parallels (he's named achilles for god's sake! i actually didn't pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time, but i went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.)of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this downside has a great upside. i absolutely love movies like this, because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. it's kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing, i guess.note: the lead in this movie (gary graham? is that his name? i refuse to go check.) is really not that bad. he makes a go of it. he's kind of cool, especially when he's drunk/hung over.

think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "power rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "robot jox". a movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. there are as i recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. so it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.

i actually paid to see this movie in the theater.it would get a 1-rating, but the fight scenes between the robots are okay, and there's a surprise.i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. i don't have a problem with that. unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons. but, one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap. i mean, couldn't they even make it "look" good?the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect, i might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor, but at the time, i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.thankfully, the experience was over in only 85 minutes.

ok this movie had a terrible premise. be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other. each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford. here's a better idea, lets rely on our most inept resource,jocks, to fight our battles. everyone says what about the director, what about him. he makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. there is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? i thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous i had to laugh. i actually had a good time watching it, well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it is a surprise, however lame) what kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one. i am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as "manos the hands of fate."the budget does not matter either, i have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. the storyline was not even plausible and i have seen better acting in school plays. surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.

there are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. the base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. the non-existent budget really killed this movie. stuart gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'honey, i shrunk the kids', which was a box office smash. however, that movie had some serious cash backing from disney. honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)

what an awful movie! the idea of robots fighting each other is cool, but the storyline is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent and special effects (on which, this type of movie must depend) are archaic. i thought it must have been made around '80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. that's 5 years after aliens! ok, lots of people said it was good considering the low budget, but i just think 'what's the point?'. it looks totally unbelievable. i wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because i still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other.

r o b o t j o x.burn the master.grotesquely horrible.no ending; no closure.completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.replaces "the adventures of pluto nash" as the worst movie of all time.i hate this utterly unacted, unedited, unscripted, undirected, unproduced mess of a thing called "robot jox" - and i just found out - they made a second one!?!? i apologize to adma sandler (zohar the beauticin) and eddie murphy (pluto nash) for hating their movies. this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. this is the only movie for which i have ever said this - remove it from netflix - now!!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.

title: robot jox (1990) director: stuart gordon cast: gary graham, anne marie johnson, paul koslo review: stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re-animator, from beyond, dagon and castle freak, took a small detour here and did a little sci-fi flick. i stress the word "little" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.the story takes place in the future. a world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the united states and russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander. lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.well, the idea is awesome i guess. the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.i as a kid loved this movie, and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like "what the hell is this piece of crap franco?" and i'm like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon?" but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. i could go through it, cause i loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. but everyone else was just not going to get it.and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good. first off. the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. but unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (empire pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.ok granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go "thats why i liked thid movie!" but every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. and boom, your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise.and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. this movie is basically a movie for kids. you know, giant robots duking it out? stop motion animation? hello? but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a good mix.so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like i do) well id suggest you steer clear away from this one. gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me. well, at least not now that i'm a full grown adult.rating: 2 out of 5

this movie was packed pull of endless surprises! just when you thought it couldn't get worse, they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined vans with raunchy sex scenes. as you can guess, i was a victim of the original version. we were tricked into watching it thinking it was supervan, the host box which promised lasars, jail breaks, and much more. who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun!

the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van, in order to seduce them. the only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late 70s. it looks like it was totally made by amateurs. it's trash, but i loved it! i have to admit i am a fan of 70s trash! hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100!2

bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex. so he buys a van to aid in this quest. the acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills. the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value.i'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. if you like devito, this is another classic devito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value.

this film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. first off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. second - wtf is going on with this van love. the plot, basically, is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which, in fairness is quite cool). unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! and he fails with some. then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. and he tips his van. at which point danny devito saves the day. although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first. i gave this 2 *'s as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's boobage too.

the title song for this movie ...........is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i first saw this movie back in 1978-79 when i first subscribed to cable. in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes. (or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri).this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called "the movie channel" - which was called "the star channel" back then, they changed the name to "the movie channel" in the early 1980's........i received a free month of "the star channel" with my new cable subscription. "the van" was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time.i remember watching this movie back then, and thinking it was a typical teen flick(along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks) ...the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties.i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades( i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin) i recognized it, and bought it for a mere $4.99.seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was(is). however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now(30+ years later).it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music, smoking weed, and having sex in the back a fancy van(often all at the same time). this is what a good teen party movie should be.there isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ...he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van(with shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it)to get her attention, and he eventually gets to have sex with her. but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him (so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans)....he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans, and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend, he wins over the heart of a preppy(lesser attractive) girl that he half/ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier/better off and the movie ends.the movie does have it's funny moments. but watching this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more of a trip down memory lane. because i still can remember pizza parlors, pinball arcades, it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid (sometimes i'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the backseat afterwords, i also remember many of the songs in this move(when they were new)......this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards (brought back lots of memories)the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is ....i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. i remember that era very well, and i don't young men going around wishing they had a van. instead i remember young men in the 70's (self included) wanting a pontiac trans am, chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang, but never a van. this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one(which just wasn't true of that era)

the cult of personality has elevated the status of roger corman, sam arkoff, lloyd kaufman etc. as kings of the b's. because the folks at crown international were so key, they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve. a film like the van may now seem like a disposable piece of drive-in esoteria, but it was a sizable hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other crown hits).the van was a perfect example of crown's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film's release. here, it was sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and the brief "custom van" fad. as others have noted, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the film refers to a chevy when the title vehicle is a dodge in the film itself. i had a town selectman where i was at the time even declare these vans to be "dens of sin on wheels!" a perfect ad line for the film!there are the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks (including a supporting bit by danny devito). in many ways this isn't much different from the old beach party movies of the 60's, but now spiced up with nudity and drug use. obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule, the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some, by today's standards certainly, un-pc views of women.the classic touch is a toaster for bobby's den of sin on wheels. yes, a toaster! hey, you gotta have something hot for those munchies!grindhouse fest.

i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.i have seen zatoichi 1-13,15,16; i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 (usa). zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing. the story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines. at one point, i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film.this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character. all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend. this is the first zatoichi film from his studio. i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films -- and recommend them.

* some spoilers *this movie is sometimes subtitled "life everlasting." that's often taken as reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once-estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send-off.there's a "hey kids, let's put on a show air" about this telemovie, which can be endearing in spots. some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances. co-writer, co-producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings-on with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real baltimore personages.that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television's show varied casts, your old favorites as well as later non-favorites.there was always a tug-of-war pitting quality-conscious executive producer barry levinson, fontana, james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious nbc execs, who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like "nash bridges," which regularly beat "homicide" in the ratings. the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form, and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it.unfortunately for this movie, fontana, co-writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel. they took the most ludicrous story are from the series, topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line, and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members.briefly, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. the former heart of baltimore's homicide unit, yaphet kotto as lt. al giardello, is now a kurt schmoke-like candidate for mayor, and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance. but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn.the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardello's son mike. a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere, esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series. but the question for viewers always was: is mike that uncomfortable as gee's son, or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role?to be fair, esposito doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption. that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters.an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted, and then seemed to actually take place, on the internet. after some red herrings, the detectives arrested a repellent suspect. but zaljko ivanek's harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be murdered later.let's summarize: he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire maryland legislature, the u.s. attorney general, nbc, court tv, the bbc, ap, reuters, people, the sun, the washington post, the new york times, the la times, time magazine, the times of london, the economist, the johannesburg mail and guardian, l'osservatore romano, le figaro, paris match, l'equipe and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case.nevertheless, the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out. there's quite an array of talent on display. unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out, some of them are merely on display.two of the strongest actors, clark johnson and melissa leo, are criminally underused, while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials. the writers do seem to satirize this, presenting jason priestley as the latest big-deal detective. on the other hand, they give easy-come, easy-go michelle forbes a very affecting scene.there's some other sly casting, with actual lt. gary d'addario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. guests drop in from other shows, like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless "miss sally" from the children's show beloved by the inmates on fontana's "oz." dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself. even when entertaining, though, these guests can be distracting. ed begley jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance, playing dr. victor ehrlich from fontana's "st. elsewhere." he's still a vivid character, and fits in a hospital setting. then you remember, didn't st. elegius turn out to be an autistic boy's fantasy?the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. this movie was made when court tv bought re-run rights to the series. that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis, who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on "oz." the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, that is, plot points for latecomers.although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito. he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. perhaps those two should have done a spin-off.as the movie winds down, the cream of the cast rises to the top. although they are saddled with a loser script, andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it. their performances remind viewers what made homicide, for considerable stretches, the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever.it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff; it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance. die-hard fans may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.

just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match. the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value. in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany, new york with the wwe championship. those men were current champion john cena, kurt angle and shawn michaels. there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; carlito or chris masters. and kane? kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998, and that was only for one night. it was obvious he wasn't going to be the one either. last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there. with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe. this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.the undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it? any pay-per-view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it. the king pinned helms (who books this stuff?) and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama.the women of the wwe also had a busy night. there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman's championship was also on the line. in a match, i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match. trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion, ric flair. this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish. edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion. the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up. they don't get much worse than this.

my wife and i just finished watching bûsu aka the booth. she fell asleep during some parts of the movie. i really wish i had taken a snooze with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep. when our protagonist speaks, it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke. he also has no redeeming qualities. i was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film.don't get me wrong, i love asian horror cinema, but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all. if you want some good asian cinema, check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror. avoid the booth like the plague, especially if you suffer from frequent migraines.

after eight moto films the series had run its course, as this last entry demonstrates. peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of moto, and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a "funny" british sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here.

between 1937 and 1939, twentieth century-fox made a ton of mr. moto films. however, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had "jumped the shark", so to speak. this phrase indicates that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula. for example, with "the brady bunch" they introduced the annoying 'cousin oliver' and with "family ties" they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season! with the moto films, they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled. in the previous film, warren hymer played an annoying wrestler. and, in this film the character archibald featherstone appears. featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever, as you kept hoping someone (preferably moto) would kill him just to shut him up!! although he's supposed to work for the famed scotland yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon "act". it's so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better moto films due to its clever plot.as for the plot, the crown of the queen of sheba is discovered in the opening scene. moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen. in a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the moto series should have ended here. with wwii approaching, the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the us or in allied countries.

has to be one of the worst wastes of 35mm movie film ever unleashed on the public, the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo-documentary original film "the legend of boggy creek". bad script, worse acting, etc., etc., dawn wells had to be hoping that gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of clap-trap.

i thought i had seen this movie, twice in fact. then i read all the other reviews, and they didn't quite match up. a man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings. i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. therefore i'm putting my review back: if you like the occasional 'b' movie, as i do, then return to boggy creek is the movie for you! whether it's setting the sleep timer, and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging out with friends. boggy creek, the mute button, and you've got a fun night of improv. look out! is the legend true? i think we just might find out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film? does our blonde, manly, young hero have any chest hair? will the exceptionally high-tech technicolor last the entire film? you'll have to watch to find out for yourself.

never saw the original movie in the series...i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. it was, however, a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark. really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. not really worth watching i would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's "the town the dreaded sundown".

...not that all disney films are garbage.anyway, i saw "legend of boggy creek" first and absolutely loved the film. when i heard it had 2 sequels, i was ecstatic. i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. i don't see how they can make a g-rated sequel to a horror film. the original is a movie/documentary about the fauke monster, and can scare anyone. "return" is for kids and should not be watched by anyone. i don't remember the plot too well, as it's been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again, but... it's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot. three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them. a big monsoon comes through. the hunters get hurt, are saved by the kids. then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm. then all of a sudden, bigfoot comes and does something really sick. i don't wanna ruin the ending for any of yas, but it's not scary. well....

talk about your waste of money.. im just wondering why michael would star in such a turkey of a movie..michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer.. that was wonderful. as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up .. michael is such a talented actor.. so what made him do this one??? i watched it and thought it was really dumb.. i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies .. especially "the squeeze" i didnt understand that one at all, and i feel his best performance was in "pacific heights" , his character really creeped me out.. and i really enjoyed "multiplicity". .that one was so hilarious !!! and he was just perfect for the role of "batman" .. and i kind of liked "night shift" and i love "johnny dangerously" too .. just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies .. like this one was...

gung ho was a good idea, however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition.in this movie the main character hunt stevenson(michael keaton) goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town. two things come at you.first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so ,and so well at that? secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs? it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitors(aside from germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding. gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel.the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans.his no.2 man saito who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so.i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be.it would have made the film more interesting.

there are laughs in this film, that is for sure. michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). however, what bothers me so much about this film, is how unlikable practically all of the characters are. other than the main two leads, everybody is a jerk. i mean, these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get. you just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. moreover, the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese nationalists. oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there.

this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies. they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables. the plot changes constantly. one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter, the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90,000 dollars. the dialogue is horrible.please don't watch this movie.

i haven't seen it in over twenty years. oj was the bus driver, arte johnson was the tour guide, lorenzo was the kidnapper.yea, lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain, a natural. i think i watched it back then most for oj, who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing, but also to see arte johnson.i was a little bored that johnson was so serious.and yes, it shifted plots. in reading other posts, i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.i was going, a stamp? if it came on as a late movie, i would probably record it to check it out again, but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it. not yet anyway.there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out.

the fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in norway is bizarre. this movie is just awful. this image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad. the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck. every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed. the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary. and the distributors; did they even see it!? this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen. to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind. i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.

this is listed as a documentary, it's not, it's filmed sort of like a documentary but that i suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming. this has just been released in the uk on dvd as an "american pie style comedy" it's not that either.basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid. throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same sort of quest and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.considering the 18 rating this has very little nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, mainly i guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.if you like crude jackass behaviour without the humour, then this may be your thing, if you have any brain cells left then i would probably avoid this!

bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. what else can i say. kate jackson must have been desperate to direct. may be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. who would put money in to producing something this bad. i like anti-christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad. the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. the special effects, if you can call them that, where laughable. i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. this so called movies original prints should be destroyed, all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie. then those people should never be allowed to act, direct or film any thing but their own home movies.

honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! this film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line. i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from "the omen" and other movies like it. for example the nanny "lucy" in this film is actually one of the devil's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan.....does this sound a lot like mrs. baylock to anyone else. another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted, just like in "the omen". however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body....yet another coincidence?????? and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls, much like the priest in "the omen" having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper. please don't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and "the omen" for you because as i've stated above there are far too many to mention here.

this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen. the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline. also, the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous. the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure, and the dad is shot by a police officer? i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for, but it could have been better. also, the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over. after hearing all of lucy's name and figuring out it was 'lucifer', i wanted to gag. yes, it's interesting that lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. it's a male's name. it should be given to a male character. all in all, the movie was a bore, and could have used a better plot.

well, it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said. but the thing is, i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen. so, i have to write something.the acting is stupid. it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. we don't see how the granpa is killed. the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die, you just don't sympathize with them. and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. we just hear him scream and we see nothing!

photography was too jumpy to follow. dark scenes hard to see.had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere. too noisy for what was really happening bottom line is it's a baddddd movie

well, i can and will be very short. this is a wrong-balanced, non-convincing film that could have been a little bit better. the script seems to not know which way to go ... from funny to cliche-wise serious... it's a bit silly. that plus too much sentences we have heard before "the hacker is in florida, or no, he is in madrid, no he is in ... , he is screwing the signal". 4 out of 10

jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. the bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "in the line of fire". the cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...

jamie foxx is my favorite comedian. however, i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker, martin lawrence and dave chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (see: money talks, blue streak).okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream. or in living color's tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire bamboozled.

what i think i'll probably like best about the new star wars film, "phantom menace", is that it will likely blow "titanic" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. every time i hear someone declare "titanic" is the greatest film they've ever seen, i think to myself, "you don't see a lot of movies, do you?" what a travesty. you could make 50 good films that are a lot better than "titanic", and for the same price tag."well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it," as someone might say in its defence. well, lots of people like the spice girls and billions and billions of people eat at mcdonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. yes, millions of elvis fans can be wrong.i'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. i waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. it's true, "phantom menace" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.james cameron's "titanic" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which i would've enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that i will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine i can think of. when i meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, i say, "i wish i could trade places with you." g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. how long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.the only reason i post this as a anonymous comment is i do not welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old leonardo dicaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and i am not really interested in hearing a defense of titanic's story, acting or length.

if you ever hear these three words uttered to you..."joe don baker", be afraid...final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named geronimo (pronounced as heronimo). he's an ugly, slimy, rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in malta who killed his partner in texas. his partner actually slumps down twice in the movie. very bad editing. joe don baker (geronimo) ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. plus, he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west. i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. a woman cop is assigned to show him around malta (who looks like elaine from seinfeld) and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck. she must be insane!the strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women. well, at least it was better than watching geronimo try to dumb his way out of something. the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable, and i was happy it was finally over. you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie.it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies...very weird! anyway, if you're up for a laugh, then see this one on mst3k sometime. also, i've heard his other bad movie (among many), "mitchell" mst3k version is being released on dvd by rhino. i can't wait to see that!

human pot roast joe don baker (mitchell) stars in this dull, unremarkable `action' movie as deputy geronimo, a fat, gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. meanwhile, a vaguely criminal guy named palermo (played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci's gates of hell) stumbles into joe don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene. joe don- slowly- gives chase and offs palermo's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase `it's your move. think you can take me? well, go ahead on'. for some reason joe don, a texas lawman, must transport palermo to italy (`mr. palermo's been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government,' says mr. wilson, another vague character played by bill mckinney, who was in master ninja 1, she freak, and a lot of good clint eastwood movies). anyhoo, joe don's plane must land on the island of malta, where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz. and that's where the movie grinds to a halt. for the rest of the movie, joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don keeps looking for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. then joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more. this is one aggravating movie.at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea. all the other characters wonder if he's dead or not, finally concluding that he is. but then he shows up (he was rescued by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. even his cute, julia louise-dreyfuss-esque sidekick doesn't welcome him back. she does, however, offer to help him find palermo, so joe don looks for palermo, looses palermo, ends up in a jail cell, is yelled at by the malta chief of police, and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more.highpoints include, a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats, some sexy strippers, a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes, a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk, and any scene without joe don. lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger.it should be noted that this is from greydon clark, director of angel's revenge, who appears as the sheriff. ick!

while not as bad as it has been made to be (i have seen much worse), this is still a very lame movie. basically a rehash of siegel's "coogan's bluff", with the main difference being that clint eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker, an unappealing actor if there was one.however, venantino venantini is great (and great fun) as the bad guy, sort of a budget vittorio gassman. he is the main reason to sit through this steampile, as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting, specially the girl. poor old rossano brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic lead (watch "mondo cane" to see him running away from women). looking here like a second-tier ben gazzara, he's given next to nothing to do. it's all joe don's show, unfortunately. and all of it scored to generic 80's "action movie" music that couldn't be more boring.greydon clark can make good b-movies ("without warning"), but here he trips, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. well, at least the malta locations were nice, and there's venantini to try to save the day. 3/10.

i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the mst3k airing. that's fair enough (that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure), but, having had the misfortune of seeing "final justice" in its original form, i'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version.first off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between rossano brazzi and venantino venantini (i could use the characters' names instead of the actors', but i just love typing the words "venantino venantini"), explaining why venantini's fugitive character can't just leave malta right away. (it's not a very convincing plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, i don't know.another plot point missing in the original: the stripper's betrayal of venantino venantini to joe don baker, seemingly unmotivated in the mst3k version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which venantini rapes her in the shower. while this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. (there's no other word for it.)some of the mst-worthy moments (the perpetual truncated shouts of "son of a--" and the "deja vu" shooting of the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited-for-tv print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie.one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version: before entering the bar to question some people, joe don asks the maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because "they see that uniform, they won't cooperate." however, joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! i can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him...one final observation on the original, uncut version of "final justice": why, oh why, did they feel the need to put venantino venantini's naked butt up on the screen?

i was excited to hear that cesar montano had decided to make a movie in the cebuano language. (not 'dialect' as most filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as. as cebuano and tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as french and spanish are to each other.) but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie. being a canadian, of cebuano parents, i was optimistic about the revival of the visayan film industry when i heard about this film. i was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as filipinos love these types of movies. but alas, i was short-changed.panaghoy serves as an ego trip for cesar montano. montano of course plays the hero of the movie. and when i say 'hero' i mean in the most stereotypical of manners; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol-anons to victory against the japanese. his character has no depth or complexity. he just fits the hero mold. the rest of the characters are one dimensional; they all fit their cookie cutter roles.i'm all for slow-moving/meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving. it didn't really meditate on anything. just because a movie is historically-themed, a drama and slow-moving doesn't make it a well-made film.particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony. his performance was embarrassing.if montano wanted to revive the visayan film industry he should have really thought this through. he said he wanted to make visayan movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc. but really, this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals. to get visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences, even if it meant sacrificing quality. obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience-attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door.i'm afraid now that visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie. if ever i said to a filipino that i want to see more visayan movies of course i'd get an answer like, "visayans don't make good movies. didn't you see panaghoy sa suba?" of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see.an example of movies that are meditative, not just slow moving, are the tagalog film blackout or david lynch's the straight story. i hate to promote the tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non-tagalog filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that blackout is a very good movie. these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called 'pure cinema'. images without words are used to convey the story. but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood.and what's with so many filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother???

oh my god this was so bad! the story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. this film takes itself far too seriously...unless of course they meant to be funny. i saw this last week at the london sci-fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. i think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at oopsalof'! and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalo's only line 'we will be together...it is our destiny.' i'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning.and what was with the apple?i recommend this as a lesson to americans: you cannot animate, so please don't try. you only embarrass yourselves.

this movie was a great disappointment for me. i had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and i was a faithful follower of chaos comics until they went bankrupt. not only did they cut out half the story line, but they altered information. the statement that lucifer is hope's father is untrue. he did corrupt her father, but he himself is not her father. the voices also did not suit the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. i can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong. the bottom line is if you love lady death do not watch this movie. it just did not do the comic justice at all!!

i also saw this amazingly bad piece of "anime" at the london sci-fi festival. if you have to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it. i found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator. the animation is awful. it is badly designed and badly executed. it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.there's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.

there's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this, lady death: the motion picture just plain sucks. aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures. the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon. just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. there is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. essentially, what we have here is a feature length episode of she-ra, princess of power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.

and it falls squarely into the category of "awesomely bad" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature, and i felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie, i think it was "sky blue", the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. i will bullet point the worst parts;script: the funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. rubbish, but eminently laughable.animation: poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (i know i can!), then watch out for the montage where she "trasforms" from a swedish peasant girl into lady death!!!characters: so one-dimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.so, in a nutshell, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain), then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a "mystery science theatre 3000" mindset. there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. do not watch this movie alone. it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than "new world" with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.

i am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything i could have imagined. the plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. the movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.with the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out.

well, i can honestly say that this is the first time that i experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. the entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. the story line was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out the window, and the animation was done by four-year olds. does that cover it? i have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. i have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews i am not off base with my observation.to begin, the story moved too quickly. for someone new to this character and situations, i needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution. i have seen other anime (if you could call this one an anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. there was nothing set aside for lady death. in a few short scenes, we see her train with cremator and instantly become this aggressive she-beast of hell. this was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father. suddenly, she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years. this was absurd. the presentation of lady death was poor, to say the least. i felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind. for me, it just didn't work. she was nothing more than eye-candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with cremator. oh, i felt sick just watching her. the same goes for the character of cremator. who was this random person? the explanation they gave wasn't enough, and instead i was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development. it is a very sad day in hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated feature.next, there was lucifer himself. let me just say that i think i could do battle with the king of hell and survive. he was weak, his voice was laughable, and he just didn't represent the image that i had in my mind. it was as if disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-pc. he lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that lucifer embodies. he was not the ruler of hell, but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live. speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in hell? that was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. most of the characters were worrying about dying, when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead. that is how they got to hell. i think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. i didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but that could just be me  or maybe it was because there was no development in this story. there was nothing built, just preparing.the battle sequences were hysterically bad. the animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. there was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn. why are we, america, so behind on animation? it is huge in asia, and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like lady death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination. we are cheap, and this film shows it.overall, this film was bad. the animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap. i had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because i think i could have made this film on my credit card. the production was horrendous as well as the story. nothing was developed, leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into. the strength of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. i wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when death does come, you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.blah! grade: * out of *****

first of all, i'd like to tell you that i'm into comics, anime, animation and such stuff. it is true that everyone has his own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. i'll be objective. to begin with the story - it's ok. follows the story line of the comic books as far as i'm familiar with them. but the animation... well, it's not actually terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. it would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985. take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. so all in all - it lacks atmosphere. i watched it, but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it. it just does not capture you. there's plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), but i don't think this is the audience for this movie. so they could add a little nudity and spice to it. the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have lady death herself! there are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. instead of bill brown's music i think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. all in all - the movie isn't that bad, but if you want something better take the original heavy metal, heavy metal fakk 2000, ralph bakshi's fire and ice or wizards maybe. and of course - vampire hunter d: bloodlust

the movie has one nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen. it is quite a long scene. what was the point? i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full minute.the movie is cold. none of the characters are even likeable. audrey tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl.i really would not recommend this movie. i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing. i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust, educated french family and he looks down on these characters.

witty. quirky. genuine. surreal. butterfly wings? one could ask what all of these words best describe, and some (those in fuse with the international film community) may quickly say happenstance, but others may jump aboard the more american train and immediately yell, the butterfly effect. strangely, i would be one of those screaming for that sci-fi kutcher film mainly because none of those words that i initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the tautou feature that i witnessed. sure, we all loved her in amelie and thought she was the daughter of jesus in the da vinci code, but in this film first-time director (of a feature film at least) laurent firode doesn't give tautou the opportunity to shine. sadly, he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too delicately caught up in the moments of "random chance" to bring this film to anything but just a shimmer (never a true boil). firode has ample, and i use "ample" as a small word, moments throughout this film where he could have built us a fantastical story, a genuinely whimsical fairy-tale of love and coincidence, but instead he fell face-first into a mud-bucket of chaotic intertwining that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us gasping for less.tautou's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box, but do not be so taken immediately as i did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into tautou's french cinema. tautou is in this film, do not get me wrong, but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story. firode's job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly (albeit confusing) ending which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing "melodrama". he utterly, utterly fails. firode fails by giving us, the audience, too many characters. with too many characters he gives us too many random interventions, and by the end you don't really care who is who, or what is what, or how is how; your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival. tautou could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only firode would have given her the center. alas, he did not, but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a theoretical film hole about the size of a penny. it just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck.firode fails because he focus' so intently on the minor details that, for one of those rare film occurrences, he actually forgets the central focus. i can say that there was no defined central focus to happenstance. in the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their horoscope promises love by the moonlight, but we never go back to that throughout the film. instead, again, we are bombarded with new characters, stuffy scenes, and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of "ifs, ands, and buts". i couldn't do it. i couldn't believe this film. writer firode (yes, the same guy directing this garbage) uses a technique so primitive in this film that i immediately felt like ending it immediately. he must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline (or the scientific premise) because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective blanks. i didn't need this, nor do i think firode needed to belittle his audience in this matter. while there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all (again, felt like a jumbled parisian collage of shredded paper), this was the icing on the cake. i don't need my hand held through films.i will give this film one star for credit. this is a rather difficult genre to master successfully. time travel films are especially hard because of the innumerable amounts of possibilities that are never accounted for, but with happenstance it works because firode semi-explores the different avenues. while i will counter with saying that he does not do it well, it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment. i liked where firode was headed with this film, he had a genuinely diagramed story, but the final execution just blew this film to shreds. firode could have saved this film if he would have strengthened his characters, while lightening up his premise and story. i think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken. oh, how i only wish i could time travel back to the production of this film to show firode the errors of his ways.overall, for the first time (and probably last), this was a tautou film that i must say utterly disappointed me. from the choppy opening to the apathetic ending, i just felt that happenstance failed due to firode's leadership and horrid marketing. marketing is something that i didn't mention before, but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an amelie 2 (per the title released in hong kong), and why would you place tautou squarely on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all. i believe that from the first minute that passed on my dvd player, this film was in shambles. while i will applaud his subject, everything else was well below the level of mediocrity. i cannot suggest this film to anyone.grade: * out of *****

a missed train. a wrong phone number. an extra cup of coffee. what happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions."happenstance" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal parisian folk. it has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.there's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man. audrey tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist (in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life.she learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her. what happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters. does the prediction come true? the concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy. the connections from one event to the next are weak. there's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the liberty mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of happenstance.if you enjoy audrey tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film, but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director.

i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. the film's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise. too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. as a result, i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. by the end of the movie, i had a "so what" attitude about all of them. a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands it is merely so-so

somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for "casablanca", didn't he? or didn't he. maybe there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood, and i'm not too fond of "casablanca" anyway. wait a minute -- yes, there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood. that's the one who wrote "casablanca." no matter. i'll put as much care into this comment as "howard w. koch" put into this production, which is to say only a little.you know what this sounds like? somebody read cliff's notes on shakespeare's "king lear" and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express, to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending.there are differences. lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him. two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money. the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear. but in the play, lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl. he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. kids can do that to you. (take my kid, for instance. after all the effort i squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? no.) in the end, everybody in the play dies.in the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy. that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself.

i absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end, after you've already invested an hour into it. and that's what happened with this film. i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story. i haven't gone to read that story but i cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends.fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect).but milo o'shea as a jew?!!!! now that was funny. i haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film. before that point, a story and characters were developing,there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted. but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that wasn't the screwiest, most worthless denouement i've ever witnessed, i don't know what is. i just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that; it feels like an act of violence.

i watched this on the tube last night. the actor's involved first caught my attention. the first scenes were attention getters. some funny some sad. good character development. i felt that the latter third of the film diverged. if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching. i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.unfortunately i feel that it never happened. i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). was that the other shoe?would i recommend? no, i think not. as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. the ending totally turned me off.

i was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a bernard malamud story. this is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. if morris mishkin (zero mostel) will only believe in the angel (belafonte), his wife fanny (ida kaminska) will recover. the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel.when he believes it, fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly. it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris.jan kadar, who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "the shop on main street" directs this film as well. kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces. she keeps calling for ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion. for most of the film, she does not realize the angel's appearance in her apartment.the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel's girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment, is memorable but all too brief.we don't know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died.those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.

lol! not a bad way to start it. i thought this was original, but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong. i never saw king kong until i was 15. i saw this film when i was 9. the film's funky disco music will get stuck in your head! not to mention the film's theme song by the yetians. this is the worst creature effects i've ever seen. at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies. memorable quotes: "take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power." i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira. there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse! in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who was falling)! also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man (1977) which came from hong kong. there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. this film will leave you laughing. it is like i said, just another king kong clone. rated pg for violence, language, thematic elements, and some scary scenes.

when i was a kid, i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our "uncle" phil. we're back! a dinosaur's story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex (voiced by the wonderful john goodman). he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live. he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back, along with some friends. the doctor/professor villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back, but i don't care about him. the kids might like this, but personally it is just too cheesy. john goodman was probably the only decent thing. poor!

children love dinosaurs. it's somewhat part of their culture. but they've got the land before time. the original. at least that movie had heart. this. this movie is just plain pathetic. just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children. this movie has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more by the numbers stuff. not as soul sucking as theodore rex, but it's lightyears away from being a land before time.

we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie. basically, dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyes(which i needed after i watched this movie). apparently, neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation. the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter(too bad the screenwriters didn't have it). by the way, does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world, neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times? why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine? disease? war? i mean come on! doesn't neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has??? finally, when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing, dancing and wrecking havoc(basically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip, i mean where else could you see a t-rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider-man?). they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes(???) makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract. why? why would kids sign a blank contract??? screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take some..."brain-drain" that he will let the children go. the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb, give in and agree to his terms. what?! this is stupid! they could have just menaced him, made him drop the contract, eaten it then walked off with the kids. i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad, which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him. oh yeah, that's not violent at all! we're back makes no sense, it's not fun, it's goofy, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film. even for a kid's film... this is bad.

this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series. a short lived japanese tv-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. this short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. a group of guys have captured a young woman. they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. they beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in "loving" closeup, push a needle through her eye. this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies, and one of the first. it was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff. they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage's movie "8 mm.". these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. they have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like "naked blood". they probably fill the void left by the mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality tv. not recommended, but will probably allure those who will see anything once, and wonder why afterwards, i know i did.

i've seen other guinea pig films, like mermaid in a manhole & he never dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them (however dark). devil's experiment though, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever. it isn't remotely scary, except for perhaps the mind-set, but it's definitely disgusting and i certainly would not call it entertainment. now, i'm not the paragon of good taste in films and i like my trash and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. i'm all for disturbing, in fact, i seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit much. the young woman is kicked, beaten, submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools, and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere. if you think that sounds great, go for it, but it certainly put me off viewing any more guinea pig stuff. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.

a found tape about 3? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways.yeah, spoiler.first of all, the acting made this short not scary at all, the woman seemed to have orgasms, not suffering. some of the punishments were so ridiculous! what's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair? if you are shooting a nonsense tape, at least make it good. the only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye, the rest of the film is really poor. to end the boredom, the supposed story about the tape being investigated, extra bullshit.

i just finished watching guinea pig - devils experiment. i have to say that this movie, although having very good fx, better then i expected, was not a good movie. i honestly cant say that i enjoyed this movie at all. of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but i found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). and also i found that the torturers were very annoying, when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time, that ruined it even more (and im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). i have now seen guinea pig 1,2,3,5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - flowers of the flesh and blood. i wont say much more about devils experiment, other than great fx, descent acting from the girl, annoying fu**ing torturers, overall i give it 4 stars on account of the fx cos they are awesome.

this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time. after having just viewed it, i can say it does not live up to those claims.the idea of the movie is indeed demented. but overall, the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy. even the final scene (the eyeball thing) isn't really that nasty. i was expecting something insane, instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sh!t.any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed, since there is no story whatsoever (though surely most people know this). gore fans will be disappointed since, contrary to belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.regardless of what people say, this movie isn't that shocking, it just plain all out sucks. avoid it.

a pale shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that the director, richard attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, needlessly "opens" it up, and muddies the thrust of the play. the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a b'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work. attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working "gypsies" living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers. the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene, showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count cassie, who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie). anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film.

i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city.. i was younger then.. but it was an excellent play.. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it.. and why michael douglas ??? he didnt suit the role.. this movie really sucked big time !!!my advise is not to rent this movie.. save your money for something better like "cats" ....

this film is regarded by some as a classic - i've no idea why. it is terrible to the point of being laughable. the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but so what! there is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and michael douglas is as depressing as ever. my brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! he was right.normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case i think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective.

hi, everyone, if you saw "singing in the rain," you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain. you also remember the dance number of donald o'connor, "make 'em laugh." if you saw "royal wedding," you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling. if you saw "jailhouse rock," you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself.that is what is missing here. there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. the closest was chuck mcgowan's "i can do that." the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film. richard attenborough was to blame for this failure. he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment. michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy. he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at. it does not work here.the cast was good except for michael, of course. a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.next time they do one of these i hope they call me first.tom willett

for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line, the movie is a shoddy substitute. not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let's face it, richard attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers.onstage, michael bennett's a chorus line was just that: michael bennett. his idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to broadway and the rest of the world. it was two hours of hard-hitting, in-your-face realism that really made you feel for these "boys" and "girls." the movie, however, lacks empathy and depth: the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning. every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; michael douglas, especially, as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. and as for him not dancing: kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway. michael bennett loved his reading, but kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part. how i wish they had done the same for douglas! a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces (vicki frederick, who played cassie on broadway, as sheila and khandi alexander, of tv's newsradio, as one of the many auditioning dancers) you're not supposed to know any of these people. because you do know these people. having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision: when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.it is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show (montage: hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled "surprise, surprise" that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars. cassie's "mirror dance" has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.for fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. for those who never got to see the original production, either on broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. and they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest-running musical in broadway history -- until a little show called cats overtook it in the late 1990's. but that is a different story, and don't even get me started there.

the broadway musical, "a chorus line" is arguably the best musical in theatre. it's about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. the film version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance, whatsoever. the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for "gandhi." why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?which brings us to the next problem. "a chorus line" takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes. it's the least flashy of broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. however, that doesn't translate well to film, and no one really thought that it would. for that reason, the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers, and should have left the theatre and audition process. the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. heck, they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations. yet, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film, as attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director (michael douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. the very beautiful "hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love"--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful, "surprise," a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar. adding insult to injury, "surprise" simply retold the same story as "hello, love" but without the wit or pathos.there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film. if you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is bob fosse's brilliant "all that jazz." while fosse's daughter is in "a chorus line," he is the fosse who should have been involved, as director. he would have known what to do with this material, which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.

by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. it was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. first, the story was "moved outside," so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. second & third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was not in the stage production was added. say what ?? i'm confused! the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die. it is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories. if you want to see a musical which includes a great "cattle call" audition, i recommend all that jazz. if you want to see the story of a chorus line, see it on stage.

i recently bought the dvd, forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of "a chorus line." every change the director attenborough made to the story failed.by making the director-cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. the show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie's character.the overall staging is very self-conscious.the only reason i give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.

michael bennett and nicholas dante's broadway show ran for years, but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, which most likely stems from the choice of director (richard attenborough, as far from b-way as you could get) and lead actor (michael douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). the slim story, about a grueling audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singers, is pushed right up on us, with loud, brassy talents playing to the rafters. nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a laughable subplot about a ex-dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old-flame douglas. the over-eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache, but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing; this, matched with attenborough's sluggish pacing, spells disaster, and even the now-famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping. *1/2 from ****

this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever. even the music has been destroyed. attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false. i will say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny.the hairstyles are remarkably dated. i can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where "a chorus line" is playing. are we to think that these people are auditioning for "a chorus line," which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? oh no, the show is collapsing on itself.i saw the original production, and have listened to the album hundreds of times. why, oh, why, did they do this?

this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful. this movie misses the mark in almost every way. even the casting is baffling. take audrey landers as val. "dance 10 looks 3" is val's song. val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she's a great dancer. what do the brilliant filmmakers do? they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great. way to miss the boat.then there's the choreography. i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave. why didn't they use his choreography? it really can't be improved upon.

i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage. the interesting thing is that you never got to see zach's face. he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production. whe i heard they were making a movie from it, i waited with bated breath, but when i watched the movie version i was so bummed-out disappointed that i felt i was cheated. the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character. personally, i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived, i would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.

if you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical "a chorus line" a pulitzer prize, and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular sensation this film certainly is not.what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me, but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay.not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. thus we are assaulted with the oscar-nominated(!) "surprise, surprise." well surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and so does the movie.grade: d

i'm not a stage purist. a movie could have been made of this play, and it would almost necessarily require changes... comme ci, comme ca. but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full-on "shallow blockbuster" mode. it would be hard to imagine a worse director. perhaps only josh logan & jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did.onstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method. dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage-career experiences (very 70s!). then bennett and hamlisch took some time, handed them a song and cast them as themselves. ...astonishing! unbelievably modern. the 'story'of acl is (in turn) about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of, because the play doesn't matter. it was meta before the idea was invented, 25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea. acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive, & which is a hallmark of modern creativity: that technique itself is compelling... that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters. what a gracious idea. the stage play had one performance area (an empty stage) and three different ways to alter the backdrop, to alleviate visual tedium, not to keep viewers distracted. the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted. it worked just fine. that was the point. all these ideas are trampled or bastardized. set-wise, there wasn't one, and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows, in which the exhilarating "one" is finally, powerfully, performed in full (gold) top hats and tails, with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions. the pent-up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts. after grampa manhandles this, it's like a mushed, strangled bird. he clearly has the earlier, respected all that jazz (and fosse's stage piece dancin') in mind as he makes his choices. hamlisch's score was edgy & interesting for it's time, but time has not been kind to it. it's as schmaltzy as "jazz hands." and that's before attenborough ever touches it. he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left, and mangling it. a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this, "could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these?" a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater (pivotal by it's absence in theater) would be addressed in the film format. there's never been a more "frontal" play. the answer they came up with was, "i'm sorry.. what was the question?" the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives, to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience, and blending their grating selves together. i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope, clowning at the (absent) audience. the play made you understand theater people. this movie just makes you want to choke them.perhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience (les miz, miss saigon) instead of relating to other characters started here. but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie. a chorus line is pure schlock.

yes, i was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of michael bennett's hit musical. it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. it is awful. almost everything fails. first off, attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie. the camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the casting!!! they are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. but this cast just gets by dancing, does a "nice" job singing but none of them spark one bit. in fact, look up the cast on imdb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (ok, ok, janet jones married gretzky - sheesh). so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. a total strike-out! (but even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was).

on broadway, a chorus line was pure magic. from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale, a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show, we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories, some funny, some clever, some stirring, of this chorus line. the movie is another matter entirely. the focus is now on the director - and what an ogre he is! every time the film switches to michael douglas, there he is with a bitter, sour expression, barking out questions and orders, screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. yikes!! that changes the dynamics of the story. on broadway, the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence, but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong/fragile/intriguing/hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize! and actually in one of the only moments the director appears, he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart-breaking story. he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection/ concern for cassie. but in the movie, from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders, the chorus line members' stories become secondary. it's like they are in a lousy profession, where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show, is jaded, exhausted, furious at having to audition these chorus members. on stage, there was always the excitement of the show. here in the movie practically from the word go, you feel sorry for everyone involved. during the course of the musical, we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well, and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! but of course that couldn't happen. but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage, sometimes reflecting us in the audience, in our hearts, and we know, also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected, they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much, bringing magic to the theatre. in the movie, after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis, that magic becomes totally diluted. all we feel (even with the exact same curtain call), is that some of the members got a job with a mean-spirited director. so they all come on the screen and are dancing again. big deal.

i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because i adored the original show. imagine my dismay.this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made. they changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. i was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror, at the ballet, and hello twelve, hello thirteen. not! not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the storyline, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello cassie and michael douglas) not present in the original, and injecting "drama" where it wasn't necessary. the original had enough pathos on its own. if you were a fan of the original broadway show, don't bother. i'm sorry i wasted my time, and diluted my memories, watching this tripe.

i saw the original "chorus line" on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. michael bennett knew he would have to re-imagine "chorus" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. if the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. however, richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of "ghandi" and dancing with animals in "doctor doolittle" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. horrible songs were added (surprise! surprise!), great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). michael douglas was mis-cast. people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy "landers" woman who couldn't sing, act, or dance - i guess she had just finished being ghandi's wife. the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from "flashdance" rejects and nothing works. i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was "a chorus line" has any thing at all to do with this film.

for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film, this film is ok as movie musicals, nothing special, just ok. i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production, the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin. first of all, for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production, let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play, the director, producer, and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. a real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes. if you're auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out. michael bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. the play is about these dancers. first of all, director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie/zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach. in the play, you never see zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon. cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry (a character who is not even in the play)was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. major musical numbers were cut or rethought. the opening number in the play "i hope i get it" shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance (can you say "audrey landers"). "goodbye 12, goodbye 13, hello love", a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as "surprise, surprise" mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie. the show's most famous song, "what i did for love" which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance, becomes just another standard love song in the film, performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie. jeffrey hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers, the choreography has to be special. there are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie, michelle johnston as bebe, and janet jones as judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet audrey landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show's best numbers, "dance 10, looks 3." i will admit that the finale, "one" is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that. i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage, this film might be worth a look, but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.

i wonder who, how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years? he's an academy award winning director. yes, he won for ghandi you moron! jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa? he has experience with musicals. really? "oh what a lovely war" have you forgotten? to answer your question, yes! the film is a disappointment, clear and simple. not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. i felt nothing. but when i saw it on stage i felt everything. the film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. great actors who could dance beautifully. well michael douglas was in it. true i forgot i'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical.

what's with indonesian musical movies? never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood. they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. it's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. the main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying. as for the casting, i don't feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.the strange thing is, why would i want to watch this movie? maybe because of the mangoes...

if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be boy. but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio.after having watched such a good movie as arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia. it seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment. that it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia. and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west, they get away with it.ok, the story is nice to begin with. and it could have developed into a nice flick. but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback, and secondly good choreography? in this movie, the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema. every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback, and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie.the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical... they only forgot to change the choreography. it is hardly dancing you see, they jump here and there, throw their legs up in the air, and that is about it.well, at least there's a happy ending.... but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do so!

this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia, recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprise, she isn't what she appears to be. the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying. kidman is actualy rather good in this role, making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting. grade: c

nothing in this film interested me. i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing. that's not laid-back stanislofsky method, that's just walking-through and saying lines, i'm afraid. kidman's performance is sad. the story is, however, mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting.

this movie is the worst ive seen.. nicole kidman really dissapointed me.. this movie has nothing. i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth. great actors but bad script.

this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd. however, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? the story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. what starts out as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word i use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. nicole kidman should know better, and ben chaplin is wasted! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel, whom i can only presume did this for the money.this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. it's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. a film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films!

it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of russians, or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in england; and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. in addition, nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains, but far to be the russian one. so nicole, if you really want to talk russian, kindly go to moscow or st. petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation.

birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy,, is it a drama...it just doesn't know. what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land. the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out. this is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine. very disappointing.

watched this film having really enjoyed gregory's girl many years ago. this was drivel. the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter, but i found it rather nasty. if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils. we were surprised that the censor let that through. apart from that the film was just a waste of time. the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly wacky and off the wall. why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible. this film failed on all counts for me. dreadful. please don't waste your time watching it. life's too short

first of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic gregory's girl and local hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated. while it's true that sequels are usually, bar a few notable exceptions, a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense. in the case of gregory's two girls, bill forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins - on the one hand revisiting the plot of gregory's girl, while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving scottish arms dealers. schoolboy gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen, he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing dorothy. although now thirty five, gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing frances, also sixteen, despite the fact that music teacher, bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him. his passion for frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend. there's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all. the main problem lies with the character of gregory himself, in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old gregory who actively and comically pursues dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over. at thirty five, gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic. outside of work his time is spent watching videos of noam chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices. as his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished, save two pointless scenes with his younger sister, who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life, we are left confused about what it is gregory really wants, who he is and why he is the way he is. why for example is he friendless? why does he never see his father, who is clearly still alive? why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended? why is he so interested in noam chomsky and injustice? why has he become so apathetic? why is he attracted to frances? why isn't he attracted to bel until the last twenty minutes of the film? what in heaven's name do bel or frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting? why does he continue to try and impress frances even after he and bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life? are we really to believe that a scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school-kids? does gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything? to make matters worse, actor john gordon sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language. unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy. on top of that, it's hard to feel any sympathy for, or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats. rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia. it's hard to know what was going through bill forsyth's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm, wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic. i can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all.that at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent. as it is gregory's two girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less. gregory's girl was responsible for launching bill forsyth's career, here's hoping that gregory's two girls won't be responsible for sinking it.

as one of the few commentators not to have seen the 1st film, i found this to be a very disappointing movie.yes, it has a funny awkward type of humour if you can bear the (highly) morally dubious premise. however, it fails abysmally in the important areas.there is thin and nonsensical plot line involving gordon sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be entwined in a conspiracy to supply dangerous electronics to third world countries - possibly in free computers ... or possibly not. vague, long-winded and inconclusive. the lack of any substantial ending is so infuriating and what is present is pompous and wholly illogical. the film feels half-finished.suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher (maria doyle kennedy) can be drawn to gordon sinclair's unimpressive character, especially when he fends off her advances. laughable. it worsens later in the film when he achieves his romantic ambitions then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value.not many films leave me feeling cheated, but i felt my time was stolen.

when i first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. bill compton introduced himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and sookie presented herself as an independent woman. however, the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box.as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting abilities. by episode 5, bill's furrowed eyebrows are so low that his face just consists of a forehead. sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only reacts to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity. personally, i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show. the way they teased each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be toyed with a bit more. as soon as sookie loses it she struts around like a total ditz, only thinking of bill's libido and the size of his appendage. bill also loses his debonair attitude and well, he just gets plain silly. his actions are never really explained except he does it for sookie. why? their love for each other is never delved into, if there is any love. so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship.yeah, yeah, vampires usually equal sex but come on. every five seconds i see some sort of humping going on. it wasn't that much of a surprise, since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show. bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason what's so ever? i laughed so hard i almost peed myself.the plot is just a stream of consciousness. the characters never go into detail about anything. all the events that happen are usually left unexplained. the only thing that is constant is the sex.the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters. tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters. the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters. minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile.

for every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. from such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.and so it goes with true blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. oh how wrong they so often are...true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. alan ball's not so secret desires for ryan (jason stackhouse) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. tara's angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the confedercy. sam finds suppressed love for sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.as for bill the vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her (although she remains somewhat unharmed). we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy meals with legs.despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad. somethings die for a reason, even vampires. maybe this show should to.

the above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit erotic,scary, suspenseful, well thought out, these are all the things this film fails to be.it is however incredibly funny, the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies i have seen in recent years. and yet this film doesn't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements, it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse.throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like santa claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground. this made me fail to believe the films title, if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting? oh well whatever, besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title. such as this one; there has been a virus sweeping through america creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. and yet there's only four zombies in the entire film. another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted. surely you'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit. in fact i believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they didn't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location, that or the director didn't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters.in fact the director had so much fun doing this that he didn't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor. and so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, whilst i assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels "editing isn't a hard job anyway right?" the only reason this "movie" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with freddy vs jason, strange how these things happen isn't it. and the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess.oh yes we did laugh at the end, but i'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity...................

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen!!!! i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one!!!and i mean never!!!!i'm a big fan of "b" horror movies. as you may imagine.... i've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer.i was lured to this movie by it's title. i mean c'mon... what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like "vampires vs. zombies"??? images of the "undead" battling each other to the "undeath" danced in my head. i thought to myself... "this i've got to see"!!!!well.... sorry to say.... "this i wish i hadn't seen"!!!!!this movies title is very misleading to say the least. there was no vampires fighting zombies. in fact, there is no plot!!!! if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea!!!there was no plot!!!! there was no story!!!! this movie absolutely makes no sense at all!!!!at the end of this debacle... i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense!!!

in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. the plot, and i use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with "the general," whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. anyone older beware.

this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. it's now a running joke among my friends and i. 1 out of 10.

a stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget.the characters aren't believable, in their motives, actions or their professed occupations. the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons(tm) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, wincing. avoid it like the plague. watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting, dialogue and plot. yuck.

if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie, then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back. i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re. first, a "special" commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection. and this "hive" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time. there's even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the dialog of re. despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "rook", the movie's nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re. so, a wag-of-the-finger to mr. richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story.they are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think.

i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. the fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.it's watchable, but barely so. there are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres. once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that. huh? vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. but that's not saying much.

what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. they must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a poison war, or something, has nearly wiped out all human civilization. in these dark times, one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort, we will call him the all knowing big boss, has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist. the spores are located far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. so, he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location. sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air. how about letting sleeping dogs lie?! the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu. as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing, engaging vivian wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much. she is an object of love, an object of desire -- a very believable concept!fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b-movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush. dinner rush is highly recommended. encrypt is not.

it's not the most well made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty amusing. the plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. i have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film, you wont find this film as funny as those who do. i knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour, in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. it's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills,most of which are ultra gory, it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch, drink and be merry!

i just finished watching this movie. i was very excited since i'm a big fan of punk rock, horror films and spoofs. i was very surprised at what i saw. i knew it was low budget, but i wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera. it opens with a good song and a great, very underrated band, the horrorpops, reforming their song, where they wander, and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways. it's a great opening. but the problem is the fact that, up until the end, this was really all that the movie was. a live performance, a death. another live performance, a death. it gets old. and there is a gross(literally) overuse of intestines in the death scenes. why doesn't the killer use other body parts, like legs, or eyeballs, or brains? don't get me wrong, this movie has some parts that are awesome. like the hardcore french band, known simply as beret, the prospect of a band named atticus, the scene containing a performance by members of the the used and simple plan playing together, since neither bands had enough members to play their show, and bowling for soup's overweight-and-proud-of-it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner, that i will save for the future watchers of this movie. but the big problem i have with this movie is the at first comical, but after a while, terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the "actors". especially warped tour creator, kevin lyman. he tries very hard, but i suspect that he didn't want to make the film, but was contractually obligated or something. in addition to that, the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the dvd. the movie's resolving plot is very hazy and very random. something about a magic sword and lloyd kaufman as the devil. bottom line, this movie has a lot of good qualities, but not enough to be anywhere near a decent horror, music, or comedy film. although i have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that i would never have listened to, otherwise. such as tsunami bomb, and the phenomonauts(an insane, psychobilly band). i recommend that you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, if you like it, watch the next 20 or 30, if you still like it, then watch on. if not, just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances. they rock! long live punk rock and horror!

well, if you like pop/punk, punk, ska, and a tad bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing the live performances are about the only thing worth watching. this movie has tons and tons of band cameos, along with president of troma, lloyd kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of goofy death scenes. sounds like it may be good, right? well, the deaths keep coming, and repeatedly to many different bands of the warp tour and the fans at the event. some of the deaths start of stylish, but then they are recycled over and over, to the point of being completely repetitive. almost everyone dies of having their head smashed, or intestines being pulled from their stomach. the gore looks as if it was from andreas schnaas' "zombie 90: extreme pestilence"; with this being the "watered-down type blood", but now that movie is actually decent, and provides humor-something that this movie terribly lacks. sure, the movie is made by doug sakmann from troma, it's got great low-budget potential, and it tries...but just too hard. everything is overly meant to be funny in this movie, and thats what brings it down. everything tries to be too comic and goofy, by using intentional bad acting, an overuse of pointless deaths, and doing the same thing...over and over. it's basically "mulva: zombie ass-kicker", "chairman of the board", or any movie you have made with your friends: it's funny to those who made it, and that's about it.great potential, great idea, great use of effects-but it's the same thing...over and over: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated.the question is for these types of movies-which is basically 'bad slap-stick'-do they try too hard, or not at all?

judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it's time in 1997 when such a topic was damn out of the boxto give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wantsthe film however is damn melodramatic, many places ridiculousone wonders why anil doesn't buy a tv for his wife? when he earns so much just to show how poor he is?the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of 80's the johny- paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn't fit in the storyeven there are several cringeworthy scenesdirection by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forcedanil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny, paresh irritates farida is decent

i gave timecop a perfect 10, i gave this 1it's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original timecop. lots of things from timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. this story is taking place in 2060 (if i remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren't... only the first one is great... and there aren't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty shortat one point in the story, the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes... no wait, make that two times...in short: don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it

well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i'll never get back on this piece of trash. i heard someone online describe this movie's villains as "subhuman cannibals", and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent. wrong! the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline. these villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch. this movie isn't so controversial, i've seen this level of gore in many films. this movie plain sucks. synopsis: a blonde who thinks she's real hot (but she isn't), her admirer, and her admirer's friend (no, i don't remember their names) go into the woods. their car breaks down. they are warned to leave by a man named mark. the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer's friend. admirer impales his foot (whoops!). don't worry, he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets impaled by nails. after a nanosecond of coaxing, the blond leaves to find help. events ensue that i cannot remember. during this and throughout the movie, we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag. blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals (even though all they are seen eating is intestines, which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food). blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard (unsuccessfully) to work up tears. then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can "out think them". mark (the man who warned them to leave) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family. then there is some shooting, they leave the house, the shooting continues, then a random guy shows up and says he's been watching them. before he is shot, we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing. the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them. there's more killing, the admirer professes his love for the blonde. then a mysterious hand covers the camera. what does that imply? i don't know, hopefully not a sequel.

wow, after trashing the disk of timo roses "rout city" after about 15 minutes (south park is about more than meaningless cursing... i guess some people just don't get it) i was interested in this movie. i read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after "rout city".surprise: the movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. timo rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror/splatter cinema like olaf ittenbach and the likes. that means "barricade" is in parts extremely gory and detailed. the gore fx are not really believable but ok, the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks. the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she's shot.so what is the problem... the movie is gory, has a typical german underground vibe (including the classic booby shots in blood), ok fx and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised?! 1. the script is total bs. you get a typical hillbilly/lost in the woods story with some guys+gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. everything is just leading towards the torture/mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. this is the first thing that makes "barricade" half-hearted.2. random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work (i liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene... either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store). even worse the editing... sure, its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random. you got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... its just there... all the time. then there's some grainy/noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it, i don't get the meaning.3. like the fore-mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here. for example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. its ok once but here its annoying and fake, especially towards the end. annoying also attributes the "music" which is permanently used without any change in the background. it doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable.4. from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing. it looks like they take it way too serious. its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context. and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly(and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists).i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and "barricade" is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb. its no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. the script is a cheap try on "wrong turn" and "tcm" leading absolutely nowhere. you can take that literally... the ending is just there and as random as many other things here ("i love you" in a splatter flick... come on!!). "barricade" tries to incorporate a lot and fails...you can sure fast-forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting,nipple pinching and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). but its really hard to get through this. total failure especially because you can see it could have been something.

the main reason for writing this review is i found this "revisioning" of a great play and worthy 1972 film, a horrible movie experience. if i can save someone from watching it, i will have done a good thing.this "new" version is loaded with talent, and it all goes wrong. kenneth branagh oks an ugly, sterile, one note set. he proceeds to film the movie from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. we see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close ups of eyes, chins, and on and on. the screenplay, by a nobel laureate, introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter, that is being faked by both parties,.... i think?? given the character "twists" how would i know? the characters themselves,so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. the running time has been cut by an hour, which is either the real problem or the kindest thing the director did for us. the actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. jude law is over the top more than caine, but as the credited producer, must have had branagh's blessing.all in all i found this to be an ugly to look at, unconvincing shell of a former classic. why was it even made??? the paying public spent less that $4m worldwide to see it! a vanity piece of work that fails at every turn.

the original "les visiteurs" was original, hilarious, interesting, balanced and near perfect. lv2 must be a candidate for "worst first sequel to a really good film". in lv2 everyone keeps shouting, when a gag doesn't work first it's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny. lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1, except of course that a parody should be inventive. if you loved lv1 just don't see this film, just see lv1 again!!

in 1993, "the visitors" was an enormous hit in france. so, the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. indeed, it's supposed to tell a sole story. jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course. the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century, and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard... instead of this, the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. as a consequence, the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed, sometimes a bit of a mess.but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. then, why did jean-marie poiré the film-maker engage muriel robin in the female main role? he made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. the other actors aren't better: marie-anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau, unbearable. of course, the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. certain sequences and dialogs are affected. it also appears hollow because poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. thus, a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.a labored and disappointing follow-up. anyway, what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?

everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! my grandma could have done better than that! but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) if the first episode of les visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one. the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it. clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, robin is trying to act like lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'. lemercier is lemercier, robin is robin! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act. i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played lemercier playing her role'! as for the story, it's just too much! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode. the gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. no, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this. the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects. so you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment'! 2/10

this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. no script since it was apparently written and added to daily. no attention to camera or shots in mind. poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101. how this pile got through no one can tell. it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. this movie has one good part ...its end! this film is my #1 worst film of all time, finally "howard the duck" is no longer the goose.

this movie begins with an ordinary funeral... and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and started skipping scenes. it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance, unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction. well, i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark, i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story, i won't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral.. my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals, perhaps she might have enjoyed this "movie".

i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad. until this. this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time. i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is. robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this 'classic'.

sometimes, making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to everyone's advantage. while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting, the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work. this film was so hideously slow and pointless, not even robin williams could save this garbage. it's obvious barry levinson's dream fell flat on its face, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop.

watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction--none.the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. so, how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly?! it's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever--much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career. the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school.the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on. i really am unsure why it was made in the first place--it certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment.

you get a gift. it is exquisitely wrapped. the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists. the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. it is a sight to behold.then you cut the ribbon, rip off the paper, open up the box, and find...nothing. that's toys. you either enjoy the packaging, or forget about it.the film isn't without its point and purpose: war is a not a good thing. well, isn't that original! the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out. and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing, until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys. it's like someone preaching a stern, condescending sermon, only to end by saying "just kidding."but even as an empty box, the film fails close scrutiny. yes, it is a sight to behold with some remarkable, striking images. the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill. but the images are cold and emotionally sterile. like the screenplay, the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal. it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things, yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold. the film strives to be funny, in a morose sort of way, but the humor is forced and artificial. robin williams, as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire, tosses in his ad-lib shtick, which only seems alien to the bizarre, coldly structured world he is inhabiting. indeed, the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be. for this film to work, or make sense, it needs to be set in its own universe, an oz far removed from kansas. every time the jokes jerk us back into reality, the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham.it is said that this was director barry levinson's pet project, one that he had been striving to get made for ten years. it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing. like most pet projects that finally get made (radioland murders, radio flyer & battlefield: earth being great examples) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage. he had already perfected it to death.many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy, mechanical, wind-up monstrosities. so is the film itself.

my life is about saving animals. i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life. i can't even kill a spider, i put it outdoors. the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. the ending - the foster parents adopt sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty. why would anyone want their child to see this film?

this film reminded me so much of "a history of violence" which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence. dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble. don't these men have a job? anyway, dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone, feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap. funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it.sam peckinpah who made the "wild bunch" which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared. but it was done with style, and you believed it. straw dogs is not believable. first of all the location is wrong and does not work. why place it in england? i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930's or something. second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife.sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one.

ridiculous fluff, that compounds its error by trying to have meaning. joan, this time as a congresswoman, agatha reed, chairwoman of a committee dedicated to "investigating the high cost of food." says congresswoman reed, "the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year, see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant." she's all business, but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from good hope college, where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night (the parallel to joan's real life is unmistakable here, as it is in all joan movies). the degree causes much consternation on campus ("that would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education!")  but joan is unaware of this as she arrives. the college president, jim merrill, played by robert young, at his handsomest, happens to be joan's former teacher  and lover. it was with *him* that she spent the night out, all those years ago, but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. naturally, this high-profile event will be covered by *life* magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? yet another of joan's old lovers  this one, she hung out with in china "during the war", and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. eve arden, playing joan's assistant, "woodie," is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job, if you didn't like her so much. but you not only like eve in this, as in all her roles, you adore her. she is so droll and no-nonsense, you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. when joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater, eve tells her it "looks fierce." but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings, she, joan, sees youth  herself at 18 "eager, expectant  a little frightened, asking 'what is life? what am i?'" but, of course, if we actually go into depth about joan at 18, the truth may be a little different. for me, this is the major problem in watching any joan movie. you can call her characters whatever you want to, but it's always all joan, all the time. so, since what we're always seeing is joan being herself, it's easy to dispense with character's names. it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something patently untrue, like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18, joan had already been around the block several times. many men would have described her as eager, and as far as being expectant, she had already had several abortions at this point. but that's a personal problem, and i digress, but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as "and then joan does" this or that, or "we see joan as..." when we are not literally watching a home movie.there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that joan and clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks. it fails. what also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness. in the story, joan has written a book about free speech and made a film (no, not the one about the plumber), and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical, dr. pitt, who is about to be fired for his views, which are shockingly similar to joan's. this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one, to be sure, but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.

a mix of ninja stuff mixed with a sub-james bond storyline. the result is incredibly awful and boring, being just the stage for endless gun battles. i can't believe this was released in theaters. terminate this movie.

this drummond entry is lacking in continuity. most of them have their elements of silliness, the postponed wedding, and so on. however, this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another. the house seems more like a city. there's also leo g. carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at. he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but drummond and the folks don't seem to pick up on anything. still, it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending.i know that algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like nigel bruce in the rathbone sherlock holmes flicks, he is so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him. is there a history behind him that will explain how he and drummond became associates?

this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters). the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film itself...hugh laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool. the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment.if you have never seen rio, or the inside of a british bank, this film is for you. 2 out of 10.

........and an extremely bad one at that!!! how long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? i can see why now.i bought the "serenity" episode from amazon unboxed. it was my first purchase, so was free. that is the only good thing about the experience (incident??)i won't comment really on the acting, since these were, i guess, fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet. at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show, theater or tv. if i did, then i have easily forgotten them.but the special effects were absolutely horrendous. true, this isn't exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original star trek did better than this & that was thirty-five years ago. i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top, while chasing after the roadrunner. modern jet/rocket engines don't even do it that bad.and that wasn't even the worst of it. the wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci-fi film or a gene autry one.regardless of the hype, don't waste your time...i did...all 80-something minutes of the disaster called "firefly".

i saw this movie the other night. i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. the writing, the voice acting, even the claymation. terrible, terrible, terrible. it's like watching 24 hours of c-span for the sake of comedy. it just doesn't work. it literally falls flat at about every spot possible.also, the movie's animation is very poor quality. i know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time. yikes. it really was that bad. if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, steer clear from this abomination. my advice: don't even buy it, or look it up for that matter. your brain will than you.

boring stuff we got here. his 5 minute shorts are better than this. know why? because there only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how ever long this is. the plot is kinda... eh.. the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny =( i had my hopes up, the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny. just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh.. not working.maybe next time knox.maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good.

although robert "knox" benfer has his fans, i'm not one of them. his films are asinine and amateurish, and and just not very funny, unless you're a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. he's certainly not famous, as him immature fans would like you to believe, by harassing people at wikipedia, or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb. he's certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets, which speaks volumes about his and his creation's "fame".benfer does have some slight skill at limited animation, but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer. as of this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.

inventor wayne szalinsky (rick moranis) is preparing to donate his problematic shrinking/expanding machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane (eve gordon) get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam (bug hall). wayne's brother gordon (stuart pankin), his wife patty (robin bartlett), and his kids jenny (allison mack) and mitch (jake richardson) volunteer to look after adam while his parents are away, but as luck would have it (and the title would lead you to expect), the grown-ups are accidentally zapped by wayne's shrinking ray. as the kids run amok, their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons, and other threats to them. this was bad, like most straight to video sequels are, honey, we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable. i had to laugh at that movie "roach" stuart pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, view at own risk!

this straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of rick moranis's career. as is the disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick cash-in; this is a lazy retread with moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. instantly dated visual effects and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, which did nothing but make me pine for the days of 'the incredible shrinking man', when this kind of thing was done properly. shockingly, this is directed by top cinematographer dean cundey, who should either stick to the day job or pick better material next time.

yes, talk about bad sequels. rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining "honey i shrunk the kids". the concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore. if you think this sounds interesting, think again. the movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst.first of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet. the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis. the actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed... you name it. they try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least.second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality. all the few jokes (and there's barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from "honey i shrunk the kids".third problem, the special effects. i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series. you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time.fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring. only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all. the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it. in this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap. disgusting.i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new. i'm warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop's shelves.

if you liked the first two films, then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one. this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video, probably tv made sequel. the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski (rick moranis) is still living with his family and he has his own company, szalinski inc. unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger. pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things, e.g. a toy car roller coaster, swimming in dip, etc. pretty poor!

the honey, i shrunk the kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. i loved honey, i shrunk the kids when i was little. it was an original story and had such an exciting plot! the sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. now honey, i blew up the kid was pretty stupid, so i think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.basically, adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. but when wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. but when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they get caught in the machine as well, leaving the kids in the house alone!the plot is silly, but like i said, it was just a family film that i think some might get a kick out of. the original honey, i shrunk the kids is the best, i think everyone could agree. the third one wasn't so bad, i would recommend this one at least over honey, i blew up the kid movie, it was at least a little more fun.4/10

i had the "privilege" of attending a special screening of 'the absence of light' at a horror convention in ohio.first off, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film, saying: "now keep in mind, we didn't have much money..." not that no-budget films are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always poor. and there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest. actually, 'absence of light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time i've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me. charismatic actors like david hess, tony todd and reggie banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names. who are their characters? what are they talking about? who cares? it's all so dull, you'll cease to care about anything or anyone.after thirty minutes of this endurance test, i gave up and walked out of the theater. not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members in attendance. any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this. with a little luck, this movie won't ever see the "light" of day.

absence of a good plot, absence of decent acting, absence of good cinematography, absence of decent looking special effects...need i go on? review may contain spoilers. the actors appear to be reading their lines, and not very well at that. most of the "actors" were acting like they were in a second grade play. the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders...it's not really all that convoluted...it's just so simple and dumb, that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. nope it's not, it's exactly as simple as you think it is. i understood the "film", that's how i know that it stunk! most of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines), trying to look sinister. the narrator was annoying. the "special effects" were laughable. i love low budget movies. i also like carolyn munro, tom savini, jack scarry, and michael berrymore...just not in this movie...you can tell they weren't getting paid, or weren't getting paid much, because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it. i love tony todd...however, he was only adequate in this movie. in fact, tony todd's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1...and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes (seriously)! i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment. if i had gone to the theater, and paid more than a dollar to see this "film" i would have been p.o.'d and demanded my money back. hopefully the people who made this will do better next time.

now i don't hate cheap movies. i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder. if i rent a movie, i want it to be a movie, not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv - tapes.maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't. maybe i hate it because it's cheap, has the dumbest plot ever, the most unrealistic characters ever and the really, really, really worst showdown in the history of films ever. even tom savini can't save this.seriously, this one is a complete waste of time.

i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn.the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. at the very least, the pacing should have been picked up.while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. many of the action scenes were just pointless.it was a complete waste of my time.

i don't know where to begin. this movie feels a lot like one of those cheap saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. sort of like captain power or the power rangers. it's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding "secret agencies" and villains.the acting is so bad that it's not even funny. the direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. it seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. for some reason, even though the device is clearly stated as being "remote detonated" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. this chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. standing up on the bikes, doing wheelies and so on. at one point, a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. then, a few seconds later the rider and bike return...apparently unscathed by the crash. at this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past, then blow up her car. which was also clearly done with cgi. sound confusing? it is, and so is the rest of the movie.i might point out that when i say cgi, we aren't talking about lord of the rings type cgi here. we're talking the cheap cheesy power rangers type cgi, actually i think it would have been done better on power rangers.why savini and todd did this movie i will never know, i can only assume they did for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it...probably the last one.

it's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts. well, i don't know anyone involved, and i've seen the final cut, and it is pure garbage. the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends (none on screen for terribly long). it's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd, tom savini, david hess and michael berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. this is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe x-files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. there is little or no action; it's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot. ther computer fx are a joke, but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way. after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button...and not letting go. absolutely worthless.

in a time when the constitution and principals the united states were founded on are trampled underfoot by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems, where the geneva convention, human rights and foreign sovereignty are unapologetically discarded, a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far exceeds that of the terrorists they are countering might seem appropriate. however, if you want to see a film about that, try ed zwick's flawed the siege instead, because nada is one of the most infantile 'political' thrillers ever made. like robert altman's pret-a-porter, the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of, and imprints his ignorance on almost every frame.his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes - fabio testi dresses as if he were auditioning for mad magazine's 'spy vs. spy' strip, michel duchaussoy behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the sociology professor from hell, mariangela melato a cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe - who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught. the corrupt authorities fare a little better, but are still painted in unconvincingly broad strokes.it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people (cf election), but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're intellectuals who are talking down to the masses. in truth, were one to recast testi, duchaussoy and melato with jim varney, johnny knoxville and shannon tweed, the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film, not lower it.chabrol might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously, but his staging is so inept (the fight scenes would embarrass a kindergarten class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself) and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some approximation of recognisable human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch (special mention must be made here of duchaussoy: so very good in chabrol's que la bete muere, he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again).chabrol has made some fine films, but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess - a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this, which would be a great shame. utter drivel, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material. one star out of ten - and that's being very generous.

"nada" was the most inadequate follow-up to "les noces rouges" which,with hindsight,appears now as the last good movie of chabrol's golden era (1967-1973) "nada" is chabrol's first real attempt at a wholly political movie;its previous work "les noces rouges" had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces."nada" includes terrorists,ambassador,hostage-taking,a lot of blood,not really chabrol's field.a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce :only duchaussoy,who had already played with the director ,and maurice garrel are up to scratch.viviane romance ,one of duvivier's actresses ("la belle equipe" "panique") ,is wasted as a madam (gabrielle).italian actors (fabio testi,lou castel)are awful.with "nada" this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol .it would be "violette nozières" before he was again at the top of his game.

saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life. don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this! yes, leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss.

woman with wig, who "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (=takes of wig) presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away:*** begin spoiler alert *** that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her. *** end of spoiler alert ***and what a spoiler that was: the title already gives it away, doesn't it? bad acting, bad script: waste of time oh yeah: in the end, she lives happily ever after....if you liked this movie, you'll really love "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death"....

i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except for janine turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings. if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all. the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner, did a good job acting. terry's husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off. he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut. her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. nice girl huh. yeah she's a real peach, not. she's no day at the beach either.

the complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. i am okay with these night time soaps, like grey's anatomy, or ugly betty, or west wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. however, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs, tim daly, and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like general hospital...or a female counterpart to baywatch. that was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.

"private practice" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written "grey's anatomy". the cast is fabulous. the premise might even work. but the writing is just terrible.the pre-pilot disguised as a grey's anatomy episode should have been my first warning. the plot was just blah. i thought maybe it was a fluke. so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes.as i was watching the pilot, i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. there's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. amazingly, this show had none of that.thinking it was a fluke, i just watched the second episode hoping for the best. and although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv.i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. not worth the effort imo, and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season. pass this one up folks.

i've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. but this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. there doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all americans. indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. for instance, in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the us. two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. what's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. the script could have been written by planned parenthood.all in all, this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.

i have seen every episode of this spin off. i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is grey's anatomy. thus i have continued to watch. i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor grey's anatomy. the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga. there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately pp is not so. i loved kate walsh's presence in ga. i'm afraid kate walsh's life in la is simply not interesting.

private practice is supposed to be a medical drama. so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. just by watching house, i "solved" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. boooring. seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap? house is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your "friend with benefits", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed "drama".and i won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite addison as we got to know her in grey's anatomy... on a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way addison ends up lusting after loser pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with mozart's requiem is a loser, phd or not) and derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle? apart from that little fling with mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. sometimes i think shonda rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one...

it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the mediocreland? "pp" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks (picket fences, ally mcbeal, and now boston legal). the crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. and that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "this could be me" sentiment. they are not funny either.the actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live. i'm a therapist, and let me tell you - amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in stanford. somebody should give them a code of ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). no therapists are that bad.women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated "sex and the city". addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well. the only successful/palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la, and the "voodoo dr" and his coping with widowhood.this concept might work with a whole new writing team.

råzone is an awful movie! it is so simple. it seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. just like zappa did many years ago. but unfortunately denmark lacks good young actors. leon are by many still the little girl in "krummernes jul", and laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. i do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like "film folket"!all in all i think people should see råzone. not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. i also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!

this film was rather a disappointment. after the very slow, very intense (and quite gory) beginning the film begins to lose it. too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about. the characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts... like, the young cop has to do dig up a body. of course it's night and it rains and he has to do it alone... yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being "nazis" plus "genetic manipulation"... wow, that's really original. there are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though reno and vincent cassel do what they can) that's definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer. the acting in "jill the ripper" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes. it doesn't know whether it wants to be an s&m flick or a really bad thriller. only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. this script should be reworked into a porn, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. a porn, even a bad porn, wouldn't do the damage to dolf lundgren's career the way that this movie has.

it just seems to run true to form, any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad! i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes, or that dolph is such a bad actor. no spoiler here, he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie. in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre.

i saw this film under the title of "tied up". in general i have enjoyed dolph's movies, so gave this one a try. it wasn't worth it. i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers. don't be fooled. this is a poor film at best. the acting is nonexistent. the plot, what little there is of one, is very predictable. the movie in places seems to be chopped together. this one just plain stinks the place up. not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. as a bit of a dolph fan, i kept waiting to see him in action. by the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. best to avoid this film, and spend your time watching almost anything else.

this unpleasant film has little to recommend it. dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed. and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.but no. motivations are either murky or trite. most of the acting is sub-par. the script creates needless confusion. and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.

dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe. he is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess of b-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, s&m) that looks like it was made up as they went along. the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick, rent red scorpion instead.

probably the worst dolph film ever. there's nothing you'd want or expect here. don't waste your time. dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life. his brother gets killed and dolph tries to figure things out. the character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly. pointless.

i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger, stallone, and even van damme to certain degree. he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. the strange thing about jill the ripper (or jill rips...or tied up) is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb, on the dvd case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. to call it campy would be a huge understatement. the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. on top of that they put lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? just the plot and premise immediately make it a b-movie porn at very best.dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered. i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren. danielle brett is lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain.i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. to explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the dvd i picked up (it was really cheap) has lundgren's character listed as "murray wilson" (not the name of his character in the film.) while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b-movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious. hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10

dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex, after his brother is murdered, wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother's secrets in this very dull thriller. lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic. also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action?

okay, i rented this movie because of the director...he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen waxork you are missing a fun ride). anyway, i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look. it's bad. very bad. if you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. first of all, the old saying 'you can't judge a book by it's cover' applies here. the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. the back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather jill and some other shots. the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think...and that's not a good thing. characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation...it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. also, what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent. to set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. avoid it!

dolph lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother,who was well thought of in the community, however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. dolph lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact on the basis of his performance here, one would forget lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. co-star danielle brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. however the movie is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot not given enough exploration (too much boring b.s around lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. once again, lundgren is actually really good (as is newcomer danielle brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing. if anything else though, it shows how underrated lundgren is, as an actor.*1/2 out of 4-(poor)

i've tried to like this film, really. in watching it, all i can think is, "this guy gives me the creeps, i would have gotten a restraining order". it also calls out codependence in capital letters. was this really the conversation before making the movie? "let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. the mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, just very few of them.

if you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them, then this one is for you! but if you are somewhat normal, and don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this one up. this movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does.with the animal snuff at the beginning, and the killing of babies in the movie (fake at least)its was enough to make myself turn it off.i've seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage (btk movie) and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie.we watch gore and horror because we know its just make-up, and special effects, so we shouldn't sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, its not what we rented the movie for.if anything, there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won;t be surprised by it. as a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned my stomach. the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked.

i happen to be the director's nephew. it's taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time. my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore (i asked). i'm looking forward to bringing him a copy.currently the film's average rating is 1.9/10. as far as i can tell, that should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the imdb "bottom 100," however with only 206 votes, it hasn't yet placed.it's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title.anyhow, i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts. best/worst gift ever?

it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays. it's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. the video store shelves are filled with these so called films. these aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. however, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'nightmare weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all. pros: the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. some unintentional hilarity. moves at a good pace (should at 81 minutes).cons: awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. doesn't make a lick of sense. badly scored. cheap and very dated effects. total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. this is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. nothing interesting or exciting happens. loaded with unnecessary padding.final thoughts: i never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but i never imagined it would be this bad. i don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you.my rating: 1/5

the acting in this movie stinks. the plot makes very little sense, but from what i gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies (or blow their heads up, whichever). and the effects are lousy, too. most of the movie consists of bad music, with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music, interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes. this should be one of the worst things ever made, but for one thing. one element of shear brilliance that makes "nightmare weekend" stand above all others. and that special quality is the presence of george.george is the lovable interface device between the scientist's daughter, jessica, and the home computer security system. with his green hair and nose, balding scalp, and heart-shaped mouth, george is the guardian angel/confidant to jessica, who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid. with his monotone synthesized voice, george tells jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses, and also that hitch-hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars. of course, little jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble, causing george to execute "emergency program code: protection jessica", which results in the violent death of jessica's would-be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls.kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light. hal should have been represented by our friend george in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise. the light and sound show at the end of "close encounters"? not bad, but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been george the hand puppet. bishop, data, r2  kitchen appliances next to the almighty george! he might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90, but don't be fooled. this show is all about george. with even that limited amount of screentime, george joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as hollywood montrose, majai, and pappy from "new moon rising" as icons of american cinema. "george to apache"  you are my hero.

one of the five worst movies i have ever watched. and i'm not exaggerating. in fact, i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching showgirls.out of 400 votes, the movie gets a user rating of 5.3/10. but there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably due to the message of the movie - nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind. chuck murdock is an all-star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons. soon "amazing grace" smith is an all-star boston celtic who is inspired by chuck's story and gives up basketball. soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world-wide protest. later all the children of the world go on a silence strike. this inspires the president of the united states to meet with the soviet premier, who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season. the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch, with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every batter, as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year.somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills amazing grace. when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it. so the president calls the underworld boss ("but it's one a.m." "i don't care, get him on the line") and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has. and to not get out of line again.honestly, this movie was so crappy that i couldn't turn it off. it was on television from 2:30 am to 4:00 am, and i watched it all. i wasn't turned off by the anti-nuclear weapons propaganda. i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports. i don't even understand why "amazing grace" smith was killed. and with all these famous athletes becoming chuck's friends, why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand. and there was the cliché moment near the end when dad tells chuck, "i never told you this, but i'm proud of you." cue hug.

if you're in the mood for some dopey light entertainment, this will pass the time. if you expect one jot of plausibility, don't bother. to me, the dance scene looked like it was exaggerated for comic effect; it didn't look especially hot or skilled.

i thought this film would be a lot better then it was. it sounded like a spoof off of the spy gener, and the start of it reminded me of pleasantvil, but this film came up short.the plot is just to ridiculous. the kgb and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their spies' how to act like americans, but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated, so they grab two yanks from the us to spice things up. i don't know, but this seems just to out there. it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent. someone screwed up in the casting job.also, for a comedy this is painfully dry. there is one, two funny spots tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance about. the film in the end will likely put you to sleep.and, as a twisted punch in the face, this film is so pro the us it makes me sick. the movie keeps on saying again and again, the us is god and russia is the devil. this is the kind of smear campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2. it's films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself.this gets a 4 out of 10, and i'm being kind. it should really get a one, but the dance scene was funny, but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny.

why does this movie fall well below standards? ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humourless script. a slim/average looking travolta (looking rather dapper in black i must say, even with a huge mullet) and gross both act very well as two young-ish 'slick-dressed' but nevertheless dimwitted new yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. other than that, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. it is so dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level. kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband-to-be travolta is one of the film's few pleasures. charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling kgb honcho "bob smith". personally, i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to 'indian springs, nebraska' (which is in the former soviet union?)--you'll understand if you see the movie... apparently, this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release. i guess paramount stalled on releasing the movie until january 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. it was reported they deemed it "unreleasable". nevertheless, this $6,000,000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing $163,000 in revenue as it was released only briefly in places like texas and colorado before heading straight-to-video. this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie.

i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets actually sold for $1). this is the only film i have ever walked out on (with my friend, while the idiocy that is the "laser bra 2000" sketch was on screen). evidently, my and my friend's reaction to the film was a common one. it is not that i found the film offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is mind-numbingly stupid and patently unfunny, devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable. this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it, rather than a failure to comprehend mr. mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to drive the film's backers into bankruptcy).i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published "10 worst films of all time" list. it certainly makes mine. you have been warned.

if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs. when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house. half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty. we refused to leave thinking it would get better. when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre. the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight. in interviews with "mr. mike" he refused to comment on this film. the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day. we all tried to contact "mr. mike" by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored.

i'm a big fan of italian films from the seventies, and i wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful barbara bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so i did go into this film with some hopes. however, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. as the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. that's basically all the plot that this movie has. the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. overall, the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.

i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first.it was awful. i actually didn't watch the end of it. it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one (all soaps are crap). the actors were poor and storyline was bad. the person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is on about. the script was awful. 2 people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no. he says "if you do that ... i will hurt you" hahahahaha. if comedy is your thing, watch away. please do not watch this film because ... it's crap!!! summary: poor acting, bad fights, bad script.don't watch! of course this is in my opinion.

the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie: 1) clichés abound. seriously, awful "twists" are everywhere.2) the narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but it's not.3) lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static, or drastically change for no good reason.4) big one: horrible acting. over the top from nearly every person.the following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) the lead is damn good looking.as i see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.b) people who often think to themselves, "i like hollywood dreck rife with clichés and overacting, but if only i could watch it in korean..." there's a lot of good korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?

i'm afraid that i didn't like this movie very much. apart from a few saving graces, it's nothing to write home about. j-horror has boomed for the last five-six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success. this is one of them.basically this is a supernatural slasher movie. the beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but soon after opens them. however, after that, it's quickly downhill for this flick.to be kind i will start with the things i like about "gawi". on the plus side, the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it's type. for those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed (no pun intended) murder scenes. we also get a few good suspense sequences/set-pieces.however, there are quite a few drawbacks also...first of all, and my major complaint about this movie, is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity. usually that's not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are, i was confused on more than one occasion.the performances are okay i guess (a little hard to tell when you don't know the language), but seem a little stiff. and for a horror movie, i don't think it was scary enough. for a while i was quite bored actually.being a fan of giallo movies, i was expecting quite a lot from "nightmare", but unfortunately i was quite disappointed.

the reviews i read for this movie were pretty decent so i decided to check it out. bad idea! this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends. the story is stupid, mix two parts ringu with one part prom night, a sprinkle of i know what you did last summer, and add a tiny dash of single white female - now blend until completely nonsensical. there is nothing new to this plot, and revisiting the clichés i've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time. this movie jumps to and from the past too much, and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didn't make much sense. characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the has-been baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the spooky quiet chick, the 'nicer-than-nice' nice girl, a freakin' black cat... and i didn't care about any of them. perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess. i should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would have been impossible to shoot. this movie isn't the worst asian horror has to offer by far, but it is still pretty bad. if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting, or just want to yell "you're stupid!" at a movie screen, or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen - this movie is for you. those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere.

that's the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their graves.i won't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they're so obvious they go without saying. small things, like this being "the all new adventures of laurel and hardy" despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made. little things like that. a bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy. as bad as that is, it might have worked. for a really bad idea, try casting two actors to impersonate the duo. okay, they might claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same.bronson pinchot can be funny. okay, forget his wacky foreigner "cousin larry" schtick in perfect strangers, and look at him in true romance. here though, he stinks. it's probably not all his fault, and, like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent. this cause is not helped here by pinchot. what is stan? welsh? iranian? pakistani? only in stan's trademark yelp does he come close, though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that's nothing to write home about. gailard sartain does slightly better as ollie, though it's like saying what's worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers? remember the originals with their split-second timing, intuitive teamwork and innate loveability? well that's absent altogether, replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps. whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels, this one has some long-winded mummy hokum (and what a lousy title!) that's mixed in with the boys' fraternity scenario. i can't claim to have seen every single one of laurel and hardy's 108 movies, but i think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves, or at least using their own accents. it at least felt natural and unforced, as opposed to the contrived caricatures pinchot and sartain are given. and since when did stan do malapropisms, and so many at that? "i was gonna give you a standing cremation"; "i would like to marinate my friend." stop it! only notable moment is a reference to bozo the clown, the cartoon character who shared larry harmon's l & h comic. harmon of course bought the name copyright (how disconcerting to see a ® after laurel and hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. questions abound. would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today? would they glass mummies with broken bottles? have stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big cgi-finale? let's hope not.i did laugh once, but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is. why was this film made in the first place? who did the makers think would like it? possibly the worst movie i've ever seen, an absolute abhorrence i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes. about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage.

yowza! if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me! this movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' laurel and hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. i blame larry harmon. dialogue is torn from old l+h movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, pinchot's accent was bizarre for stan, and while sartain did an excellent job with ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr. hardy. where was a (good) musical number? editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. it's even more painful to watch than atoll k, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can, and learn how things were. you know what a magnate is, don't you? stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update/honor of the boys. where was the classic theme song?!? why ruin 'here's another fine mess'? why skip 'any the wiser'? why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! why miss gulch from the wizard of oz???? why must larry harmon be in it? why bozo!? and did the learning channel help fund the thing?i mean, really. fart jokes, for god's sake.fart jokes.

i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're-enactment', but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h. bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there's a reasonably good supporting cast. i enjoyed it.

for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. the plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the "f" word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so 'let's throw in another couple of "f's" for good measure, that's what the american public wants to hear'. gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part. forget this c__p, rent 'shrek" and have a good laugh.

"jason priestly stars as 'breakfast', a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is frighteningly precarious, according to the dvd sleeve, "with his accomplice 'panda' (bernie coulson), the duo make off with a carload of cash, a result of a tip-off from beautiful cashier 'ziggy' (laura harris). her reward: to hitch a ride with the out-of-control duo so that she can meet her long-lost father francis (stephen mchattie). but he's on a suicidal quest to even a score with his former boss (louis gossett, jr.) and has the cops hot on his trail. rage, murder and revenge are about to collide!" stay out of their way!*** the highwayman (4/28/00) keoni waxman ~ jason priestly, laura harris, stephen mchattie

the first one was the best. the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible. although, the storyline wasn't so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). throughout the movie, i dosed off a few times. i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in rush hour 2. chris tucker, too, wasn't good. and zhang ziyi, what can i say, a few lines, terrible acting (but that's based on her script). all the characters there were not that good. but, some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him.

designed only to annoy (or amuse) any self-respecting intelligent person. if the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character, then it would have been okay, but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of america's pro-marxist 60s movement, especially not a filmmaker from the 70s. there is so much idiotic dialog going on here, that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy. you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that's how naïve the movie appears. spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious, inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons. but, i mean, aren't they all? nice boobs, but s**t for brains.

please don't hate me but i have to be honest, watching this movie, i had a lot of fun,,it's a movie with a stupid cast and stupid songs!!!unnecessary songs!!! mehbooba... a total insult to the original one holi.... well.. it was ok! due to the tradition every movie got to have one!! chad raha hai nasha whatever... very unneeded stupid song jee le... sounded like a playboy song stupid song...other than songs. the movie was ok this was ram gopal verma's own adaptation... if you think like that you will like this moviewell this movie only depends on the viewer and on his judgement whether he/she thinks this movie is total copy he/she would want to hit her head on the cinema seat or if he/she thinks of the directors own look he/she would be relaxed and take a look at this movieanyways i looked at both ways i would congratulate and abuse ram gopal for this disaster that he made...well some other things that bothered that the cast was incredibly badamitabh bachchan as babban/gabbar (amitabh in his own movie remake funny what was the director thinking) ajay devgan as heero/veeru(bobby deol could have been better) prashant raj as raj/jai(abhishek was meant for this role despite doing a special appearance in the mehbooba song) sushmita sen as radha/durga(jaya bachchan was right tabu was right for this role) nisha kothari as ghungroo/basanti(i think esha deol would have been great) mohanlal as narishma/thakur(mohanlal is so cute....oops sorry hehehehe, he was ok i could not think of anyone)the movie would have even faired a little if the cast was oki movie wasn't even exciting, the movie was just ok , just for watchingthe overall ratingdirection... 8/10 i got to him some credit cinematography... 9/10 script... 3/10 bad scripting songs... 5/10 unnecessary in the movie, could have been better, easy on the ears on to be played in pc's and ipod's and stuff cast... 1/10total ... 3/10syed shabbir aly naqvi from pakistan

not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the dvd case. the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj. nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. as for prashant raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. ajay devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, rgv's aag is worth watching for amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance.

its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there. a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do.biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed. actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time-pass of songs. and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have

i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made, because i haven't seen every bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be.this film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission. no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.but lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. there is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. the lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. and, of course the actors! some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of india's most loved movie of all time, 'sholay'. one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are a-list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? so it begs the question, amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.i truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.

this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie "sholay", but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. waste of money, waste of time. after making movies like rangeela, satya, and company he pulled a coppola (godfather) on us; what were you thinking rgv? anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the old sholay. ajay devgan playing heero (beeru, sholay) and ajay, new kid on the block playing ajay (jay,sholay). both "bad yet funny" friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. later in the movie, now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan. in case you haven't been watching bollywood movies, the good guys win in the end. there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!

in a variant of sholay , ram gopal verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape. the thakur goes south.mohanlal as narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance madrasi style. the accent is totally south indian in contrast to thakur from the north. the severing of the hands of thakur by gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in aag. so make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered kurta covers up for the cut fingers. moreso in the climax where the thakur uses his legs and says"tere liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai" here narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain. babban, the new avtar of gabbar is also different. he is not from bihar or up. he is bambaiya. gabbar's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued. babban asks for diwali instead of holi and romances urmila the replacement of helen in mehbooba. he also dances and enjoys dancing with abhisheh who plays jalal agha in mehbooba.babban is more intelligent this time. he tosses the apple and asks the question that made isaac newton discover laws of gravitation. basanti is more verbose than the auto driver ghungroo. nisha kothari cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like 'entertain' and 'too much' with gay abandon. viru was fun whereas ajay devgun is a misfit for the role. the god speaks to basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the koi haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful. the water tank turns into a well and the drunk devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide. jai was composed and serious. prashant raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him. but he also bungles on the mausi sequence. he is not as romantic as jai with the mouth organ . jaya's role played by sushmita changes careers. a pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed. she too lacks the pain that jaya displayed. her flirtations with jai are more open this time. samba gets a bigger role this time as tambe. he does not have to point guns and answer questions of gabbar this time. he follows babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den. horses give way to jeeps and auto. the gabbar's hideout here keeps changing and ramgarh becomes kaliganj. all in all it is more of a spoof than anything else. rgv comes up with his own interpretation of the classic. but we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues. so we call it a spoof. so mr.rgv(sholay ) and farhan akhtar (don) and jpdutta(umrao jaan) stop making remixes and start making originals.

i downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the quality was kinda good! i was watching the movie with high expectations (though i knew it was a flop), especially as the film has superstar amitabh bachchan playing the role of a villain.i though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.but unfortunately mr bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete amjad khan's magic rgv's trial to re-kindle the past backfired royally! sholay, the old one is a milestone in indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.a good actor like ajay devgan's talents are wasted and his performance was average.prashant raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is . nisha kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have i don't know how she is still in rgv's crew urmila & abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion mohanlal tried his best and susmitha sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie it was a total carnage of the original sholay

iam a big fan of mr ram gopal varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.ram gopal varma ki aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real sholay. it does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . there is no camaraderie between heero(ajay devgan) and raj(prashant raj). there are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. the sequence outside the courtroom with amitabh bachchan and mohanlal face off is remarkable. amitabh bachchan should not have done this movie. ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. rajpal yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. rest of the cast was below expectation. the comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.ram gopal varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this aag. but there is no fire.

sholay: considered to be one of the greatest films. i always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is. that was the time rgv announced this movie and i was somewhat excited to see it. i always thought that maybe this will be a good movie, but every week we would here rgv change something. and the movie is a very b-grade movie, something that i had not hoped.i really tried looking for positives, but i promised to keep sholay out of my mind. the cinematography is awesome. the movie tries to be its own. but that is the up side. the action sequences are weak. the screenplay had potential. the biggest flaw is editing. none of the scenes excite you. for example, the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced. ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original. and none of the characters are developed. and no scenes will linger until the end. and the ending was very disappointing.the biggest question is acting. amitabh bachchan was good as gabbar singh, nothing great. it seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look, that the character only looks menacing, but you don't get creeped out. mohanlal is barely in the movie, but he impresses in his few scenes. ajay devgan was decent. it wasn't so much the performance, he gave it his all, it was the weak script. prashant raj is very confident, and has potential to make it far with better movies.i had most expectations for sushmita sen, who was probably the best of the lot. she was expressive, but this still was not enough. nisha kothari surprised me. she seemed disinterested for the most part, but her emotional scene after her friend's death was quite good. seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent, not her cute looks. but what disappointed me most was chemistry. ajay devgan and prashant raj didn't look like friends. ajay-nisha were not a strong couple. no passion was to be found between sushmita and prashant. and amitabh and mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.as for songs, they pretty much suck. urmila's mehbooba was too overblown and i pretty much slept through it. it was however nicely danced. the holi number was enjoyable, but not memorable. same went for the other songs. for someone who looked forward to this movie, i was heavily disappointed. i had high hopes for rgv because of his jungle, but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie. but hopefully he regains his talent for sarkar raj. but this movie is best forgotten. all the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is.

once in a while in indian cinema there comes along a movie like sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. and den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a rgv ki aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. a standard so low, it can never be broken. ram gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. to take a classic like sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and i can't believe he almost called the movie rgv ki sholay. although sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. what aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst. the realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of "actors" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. one star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for rgv to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another "different" plot that can be categorized under cinema.

i must tell you right up front, i am certainly not an authority on bollywood films and have only seen a handful. however, if you've never seen one, don't start with this one! i have greatly enjoyed the ones i've seen up until this one, but i just couldn't stand this one. i also must tell you up front that i could not finish this film--it was that annoying. so why was it so annoying? 1. there is a character named 'rambha' in the film. he is even more annoying than jar-jar binks--which i never would have believed would have been possible. he is so #@^!# annoying!! he spoke in a falsetto voice and i think was meant to be comic relief. instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! his voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! 2. the heroes had the amazing ability to dodge ak-47 bullets with ease. i kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! and, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet and beat up the ruffians!!! this made stallone's actions in "rambo ii" look mundane!! 3. the film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! it was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.4. the two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! perhaps if you are the most ardent action and bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me i can see why it's on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list. wow...this film is bad and intensely bad!!

truly shows that hype is not everything. shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife. amitabh as always is solid. ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke. the leading lady is such a waste of an actor. such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry. with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i watch.rgv has been making very crappy movies for a while now. time to get different actors. hrithek anyone? bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back. every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be. pffffft.

overall performance :- at last the long waiting aag hits the screens. unfortunately, it couldn't set progressive fire in the audience. the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay. and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie. if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop, people will again say there is nothing new in this. different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy. right from the start of his career with siva in telugu, he had been using the same lighting and kind of background. i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather. it's all dutch dutch dutch dutch. why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots!!!!!!! the shot division is lame. characters couldn't carry an emotion, performances are not to their mark, storytelling is worse, background is really really terrible.babban:- amitabhz been over prioritized to his job. varma produced great villains like bikumatre, bhavtakur das, mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema. there's no comparison of gabbar with babban. babban is a more psycho rather than a villain, still he has a soft corner for his brother ( it's a gift in this movie). amitabhz performance is not to his mark. his appearance itself is pathetic. the scar on his nose, symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. what ever they worked on babban is not successful. babban is no comparison with gabbar.narsimha:- the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands. if varma did that , it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder. itz good he opened the secret early. but the flashback is pathetic. varma couldn't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.durga:- the only character with betterment. this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.heroo, raj, ghunguroo:- no body bothers or at least considers these character. the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz. these characters carry nothing to this movie.ramgopalvarma:- his quality is degrading, diminishing. aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie. sholay is a fire of revenge, problem of a town, meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra. aag never carried an emotion with its characters. storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters. don't compare aag with sholay, still u will not like it.if you dare watch this movie. you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag

this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema!! could not wait for it to end. to make matters worse it is given a 12a certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot, just bodies slumping to the ground, even babban getting killed was cut out!!! too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop disastrously!! amitabhs acting was great but that 'basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays devgans mate can't even act. devgan was wasted!!i would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned!!

i can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching ramgopal varma ki aag, the director's half-hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western, sholay. the biggest problem with varma's remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film. it's evident in every single frame of this movie that varma's heart is just not in it. what you see on screen is a bad joke at best, a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker, and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life.i've seen several bad films over the years, but i can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one. consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film, because it tests your patience like few films have before.varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film, but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of sholay. ramgopal varma ki aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not - way-over-the-top, too-long-too-boring, and entirely mindless. much-loved moments from sholay are parodied by varma and for that you want to wring his neck. one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which dharmendra as veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay devgan playing hero, pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself. how you wish he'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony.not only does ramgopal varma ki aag fail as a remake of sholay, it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand-alone film. the eardrum-damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen, and the camera-work alternates between dramatic and head-spinning. partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead-as-wood actors. sushmita sen as devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously, punctuating her lines with pauses, staring into camera for effect, and generally performing like her life depends upon it. mohanlal as narsimha, struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career. newcomer prashant raj playing jai-equivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't strum up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original film.as hero, the new-age veeru, ajay devgan is entirely hopeless, failing miserably in his attempts at comedy. but the film's weakest link, easily the most shocking casting decision is nisha kothari as ghunghroo, who steps into the shoes of hema malini as basanti, the endearing airhead from sholay. nisha kothari is not only the worst actress in this country, but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world, she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning, and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she's on screen. and then, there is amitabh bachchan playing babban singh, ramgopal varma's version of hindi cinema's most popular villain gabbar singh. the only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film's over-the-top tone and plays along accordingly, bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch. he's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams, and he does all of that to good effect. but because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise, his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way.no surprises here, i'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for ramgopal varma ki aag, it one's of those painful movie-watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to. it's not like varma hasn't handled a remake before. with sarkar he gave us a smart, gripping take on the godfather, and it's a pity he's made this sholay bhature out of such a much-loved classic. ramgopal varma ki aag is his worst career decision ever, it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever. i suspect this film will go down in movie history as ramgopal varma ka daag.

something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. the movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.the editing is poor. direction is crap. acting is out of this world(omg)! the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.i wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.

i, like many other bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay. this movie was not it. thank god they didn't let them use the name "sholay" in the movie title. ram gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. the camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen. you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. the only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash? save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out.

first of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). the film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting. 1) to start with, the name of the movie is really c class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) amitabh bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) in sholay gabbar singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). here in aag the figure was 100 crores for babban (amitabh bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). making a sholay like movie in mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) as for nisha kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. why is ram gopal verma casting her again and again ? 5) mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) sushant singh and rajpal yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) legendry role played by lila misra (mausi of basanti) in sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some gangu mummy. ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. enough of stupid characters in your movie like shiva and aag. 8) should not say anything about modern jai and veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.to summarize, i was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. please don't waste money and time on this movie. i think watching aap ka surror (which i thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction.thanks, saurabh

this film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! i mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. i nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. what was he trying to do? be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black? ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. what was amitabh doing? he's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and i'm telling you he's already past half his way. i mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh. i never really liked him because he thinks he's god and i just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie. if you want to save your £17.75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!

this is the first time i'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb. but i had to write it for this one. its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture. from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad. the acting is pathetic. i'm a big fan of ajay devgan (loved him in bhagat singh) but he is at his worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. i have no clue why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work. please don't watch it

i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring. i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle. amithab bachan's acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure. nobody did justice to their work, including ajay devagan. this film don't deserve any audiences. i bet that this film will flop. "finally this movie sucks"

what's happening to rgv? he seems to repeat himself in every movie. has he run out of creative ideas? if he has, time to take a back seat. went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original. i knew it wouldn't, the promos said it all. but even then i thought it would be a great rgv treat, after all isn't he the same guy who directed sathya and company? or is he? i have my doubts after watching aag. i am not going to talk about the plot or the story, as most of it is taken from the original, if you are really dying to go and see this one, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own! so veeru becomes heero (how corny is that?), guess heeru wouldn't sound that great. ajay devgan is quite a disaster as heero, the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in company sounds fake. the chemistry between heero and gunghroo (nisha kothari) doesn't exists at all. in fact the more charming nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes. this reaches a peak by the end. raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as babban, he looks like a caricature of gabbar singh. there is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl, instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl. the only performance that really stood out was mohan lal as inspector narasimha. i am afraid i don't have the patience to write more.

if the scale went negative i would be happier. seeing sushmita sen was nice, and nisha kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story. the choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story. oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first. the film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "seven samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help. this movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was bad - probably the food from the caterer was bad too. i have never in 6 years of watching indian (bollywood) movies seen something this badly made.

the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that doesn't make up for the fact that it's pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre script.b grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish.it would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making.hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video.this film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april 10, 2002. i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party - they're gonna need it.

i can sit through this movie once, but i doubt i could make it through a second time. mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan. the fun of matt dillon(think something about mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton. this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable. one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part. i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. go see this with your little ones, i.e. the "single digit bracket" kids and don't expect a lot from this film._x

herbie, the volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by maggie peyton (lindsay lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a nascar champion. the only thing standing in her way is the current champion, trip murphy (matt dillon), who will do anything to stop them.the original love bug wasn't that good. even as a kid, i remember not liking it very much. i had some hope for the sequel though. i mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. unfortunately, herbie is no better now than he was before. the film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. it will probably entertain the kids but that's all.i realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. there were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. lindsay lohan was alright as maggie peyton. she usually gives better performances like in freaky friday and mean girls. matt dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. he was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. justin long, breckin meyer and michael keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.angela robinson directs and she does an okay job. she tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. thomas lennon and ben garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for taxi and the pacifier? these two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. it's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. in the end, herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. everyone else is better off skipping it. rating 4/10

a failure. the movie was just not good. it has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at. i mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. lindsey lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies. the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie, that is free.the only thing that was well done about this movie was the music. nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day. these songs are so good. especially alyson and amanda's walking on sunshine and caleigh peter's, beach boy song, fun fun fun.4 out of 10. if i gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie. not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.

i went to see this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. i insisted we go the matinée showing, not because i'm a tightwad, but just feeling i had. in the nascar spirit, this is a sponser's dream. so much blatant advertising, it almost qualifies as an info-mercial, if it weren't for the so-called acting. keeping with tradition, the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is only a 'vehicle' (no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture. earlier herbie installments (although cheesy as well) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. ms. lohan, disney's reigning drama queen, has little acting ability. i was surprised that mr. keaton and mr. dillon would get involved in such a project. only the snack bar, was a bigger ripoff!

there are few uplifting things to say about this, but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent, we end up with movies like this.lindsay lohan who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take. here she can only fail.children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children (although still pretty dumb). the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes. and as a family sports movie this is horrible. the better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car-bash fest creating some tension. if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here. after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.

the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! a would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) as if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! the languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the "euro-cult" style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson (who appeared in six latter-day luis bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time!

i have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so that was not my problem with it. my problem with it is that i felt like i was watching my next door neighbor's home movie. imo everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. i understand how hard this must be to do effectively, but when i pay to rent a film, i expect to feel like i am watching some type of professionally made movie.john schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. the other people in it were not. i understand how it must be fun, and cheaper to use friends, and relatives as the cast, but it doesn't make for convincing acting. it seemed like the way it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the writing, plot, and acting are there to begin with, that type of style isn't necessary, and it is a distraction.also on a technical level, it had digital artifacts all over the place. in the first scene of all of those fine cars, when they did a slow scan of them, they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit. the problem isn't in my viewing equipment, (benq pe-8700 84" diagonal) but somewhere in the production. i've never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before. then there was the sound. it sounded like they didn't do any voice-overs, which may be o.k. unless it sounded like the track in this film. it sounded like the built in microphone on the camera.

profanity, stupidity, self-indulgence, and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie-making. pesci's attempt to prove my cousin vinny was no fluke, shows the opposite instead. he is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead. a true must-miss!

in this movie, joe pesci slams dunks a basketball. joe pesci...and being consistent, the rest of the script is equally not believable.pesci is a funny guy, which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar, but the other roles were pretty bad. the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which wasn't even well-played. instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something...i don't even remember...she was that forgettable.anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film, or at least one of those millions of media minions who can't critique efficiently (you know, the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).stay away...far away. and shame on comedy central, where i saw this film. they usually pick better.

this foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears: he is dead. perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a. martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. that a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. his moment is brief; his promise is immense. perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film.

the most horrible retelling of a great series. it should not have been named battlestar galactica, because it's only the same in name alone. too many changes to just have changes. you have characters turned from male to female, black to asian to cylon all in a way to "attract female audiences," when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger. gone are the egyptian feeling. gone are the quest for earth. the lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film, especially when one is made a fembot. granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it, but it had a large following. they tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it "their own story." changes are good, when they make something better, not to just make them.

rating: 4 out of 10as this mini-series approached, and we were well aware of it for the last six months as sci-fi channel continued to pepper their shows with bg ads, i confess that i felt a growing unease as i learned more.as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time, different people go to it to see different things. in this regard, when people think of battlestar galactica, they remember different things. for some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor. for others, it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s, especially those on television. for some the memories resolve around the story arc. others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced.frankly, i come from the latter group. the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire. yes, evil. the cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it. while base stars were swirling around, men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow they managed to survive until the next show. they didn't survive because they had better technology, or more fire power. they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show.the show had its flaws, and at times was sappy, but they were people you could care about.the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this. in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show, the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction. since that was their goal, they can be judged on how well they accomplished it: failure. it was far from a reinvention. in fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time. it borrows liberally from st:tng, st:ds9, babylon 5, and even battlefield earth. i find that unfortunate.ronald d. moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade, and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see. one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d & e. that was the inviolable rule of roddenberry's st:tng. like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority, ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master: gene roddenberry. here, instead of writing the best story possible, he has created a dysfuntional cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could. besides being dysfunctional, some of it was not the least bit believable. anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days "in hack," they could have gotten execution, and they never would have gotten out the next day. it wouldn't have happened, period, especially in time of war.the thing that i remembered most of ron moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt. james kirk. he killed capt. kirk, and, alas for me, he has killed battlestar galactica.

i have yesterday seen the second part. and i must say, it was actually better then the first one. at the begin, i realized, it is actually a sequel, not a remake but not a good one. i do not like the old movies and series of galactica, because the cylons saw like toasters (just as it was mentioned in this new movie) and were completely harmless for the old galactica. this movie turns the sides - the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid. many scenes were unnecessary, for instance the story of the "computer expert" - completely a crap. if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house, killed by the cylon woman. and the evacuation from the planet? oh, please if it would be bombed by 50 megatons (why exactly 50 mt??) nukes, they would be dead killed by the radiation. and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack? aha, it was possibly this computer virus, created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy. the good side of the movie is, that the humans are at last defeated!! really defeated, the population is near the extinction (children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie: 1. a baby!!! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence...). and the bad-asses won and i think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie. i also appreciate the design of the cylons (not only of the humanoid cylon:-) a good job with these ships - i like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons. the human ships are a good never version of the old ones. and galactica - really pretty with these docks, i liked that. but this is all, only the design is not enough. the acting was really bad, the whole plot was expectable (only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end).the dialogs were trivial (and in the slovak dabbing just stupid, but that is not fault of the movie). the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series, but who would shoot such series? what it would be about? one star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity.

i fail to see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be sci-fi). it's really just "let's see what soap operatically happens this week" and oh, the cylons are involved through flashbacks.the cylon "babe" that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that t&a was added to the show. every time she pops up i'm bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on. and don't even try to bullsh*t me about "story arcs".it's a soap opera with some cgi thrown-in. this is not science fiction aside from the original premise.this series is not everything it's worked-up to be. if you like trendy, edgy, dodgy, jumpy, vague editor-on-crack camera work, this show might be for you. since nerds seem to be raving about this show, it's a clear indication that vocal nerds' opinions have been changed from picard's tng.

sorry, but every time i see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. so the new (female) starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age kattee sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as "a compelling, exciting, must-see, ground-breaking performance," by the politically correct new-speak of today's review copy editors; but in essence, it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest cliché on screens today. i may give this series one more shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in. as james hilton once bemoaned, "a story, please; just give me a story."

avoid this one, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. example? the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a french film.this film attempts to combine western, drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic. what? well, consider this. the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights. or how about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed?someone should do a 'what's up tiger lily' on this bomb. rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it. heck, it's almost that now. (btw, gerard depardieu and carole bouquet, both known to american audiences, have roles.)

this is one of the worst movies i saw! i dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap. don't waste your time watching this. good actors, but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. hope there'll be no blanche 2 :-) avoid this movie by all means!

i went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the wrong reasons. this film is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for josé garcia and gérard depardieu ), and it's boring, boring, boring. it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny " what, what did he say", and i'm french. i hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of france ).we're deeply sorry for that cr@p. 2/10

after watching the first 20mn of blanche(sorry i couldn't take more of it), i have now confirmed she does not. basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk. it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies ("deux heures moins le quart avant jesus christ", "la folie des grandeurs",...): a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues. this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction avoiding the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma.unfortunately, the horsey-faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie. horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune, zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.

i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what's up tiger lily with this film.it has to be one of the worst french films i've seen in a long time (actually along with brotherwood of the wolves, 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time).it's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun. antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings, i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film.lou doyon is quite bad, as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent.avoid this film, if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d'artagnan.

how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a... a... well, such a thing ? i can't get it. it was awful, very baldy played (but some of the few leading roles), the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny... i won't talk more about this movie, except for one little piece of advice : do not go see it, it will be a waste of time and money.

the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies. they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. this film, released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans. it's extremely awkward and laughable, but well quite enjoyable too. after all, we do like these creatures and these films after all, don't we?

i usually check out the mtv movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example). so this year was no different. while i'm not a fan of justin timberlake, seann william scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me. i've laughed at stiffler in both american pie movies, and even enjoyed him in dude where's my car?. but the mtv movie awards were simply horrible. nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell can't act.i'm curious as to who the writers were for this show. last year's performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny (the lord of the rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show), but this year was completly different. did anyone understand timberlake's comments regarding luke wilson and kate hudson ("they're staring in a movie together, but have never met! here they are...") where was the joke? kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue, never making a reference to the "joke" by timberlake. and seann was completly wasted as a talent, not even causing me to smile, yet alone laugh. and what was the point of harrison ford's one-liners? did they make any sense to anyone? perhaps the mtv writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging ford as han solo, indiania jones, or the president from air force one. i'm baffled. and would someone tell me the deal with adrian brody? how old is this guy and how old does he think he is? the guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again....give it up, show some class (like in your best actor academy award speech) and act your age!i give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance. this was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.

this was the worst mtv movie awards ever!!! i barely laughed, none of the presenters were funny, the hosts really sucked, and the parodies weren't so great either. why can't we go back to the good olden days when the show was a riot?

this movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious. the box art for the video markets it as a "fun throwback" to 1950s giant bug movies. in reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of "aliens".the producers clearly wanted to make an "alien" picture, but they mustn't have had much money. in fact, it doesn't look like they had any money, really. i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing.the basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, i presume. instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare. the amusing thing about "blue monkey" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the "alien" aesthetics. even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable "growth hormone" plot device. the annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth. the boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.the idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. he touches it and says "ow", so we know he's been hurt. the cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (i guess in an "alien" picture this would be called the "mouthburster"?). the worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and "accidentally" give it some experimental growth hormone. you know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness.which brings us back to "alien". how, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the "alien" movies? no problem...a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie. this doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a cootie toy).ok, so what "alien" bases haven't we covered...oh, water dripping down the walls! check...we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side. problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous "foreboding tunnel" shots. and don't forget the fog...well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? ok, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn.i haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. i take it "blue monkey" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag. see a film called "return of the aliens: the deadly spawn" if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent. this one falls flat on its alien.

oh god,what an idiotic movie!incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(ha!ha!ha!)...they're simply ludicrous.for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).all in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.avoid it like the plague.am i drunk?i don't think so...

an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. he gets pricked by it, or bitten by something on it. he quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind. a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out. somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. there are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats. they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept, and happen to dump a growth hormone on it. horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they're never even in any danger.the critter grows and starts breeding. people run away from it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.there are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster. it was fairly boring. clearly it owes something to the alien movies, with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth. there's also a character named bishop, and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair.

blue monkey (1987) or 'invasion of the bodysuckers' as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant!!!! the man gets rushed to hospital, where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage!! despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie, i found it to be boring, with a flat predictable storyline, un-interesting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action!!!! horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me!!! i give this movie 2/10.

now, it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title, so i'll wait on that. first, this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles. then i realized it, this is a movie with a message, that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen. things like what you ask? things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical "kill the monster indirectly" fashion. now, as promised... blue monkey... has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind. now it snot like i was cheated or anything. the picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses. that kinda happened but i wanted apes! having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before(half drunk on cask and creame's brandy mind you) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80's style. not so much. if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you. if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids, rent this.

all this dismaying waste of film stock needs is count floyd popping up every sixty seconds. somehow they got steve railsback, susan anspach, john vernon, and joe flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles, about eight kilometers, of an actual movie. boy does this thing suck. there isn't one original line, thought, shot, or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close. the magical, ethereal susan anspach of five easy pieces - boring. steve railsback - boring. john vernon - boring. the big bug - boring. if this is a scary movie, buttercream gang is a thuglife documentary. seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness. usually it's in the opening credits - "written, directed, and produced by" one guy. or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made. here, you don't find out till the very last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the canadian government is gratefully acknowledged. right now i'm watching mst's take on beast of yucca flats to get the taste out of my mouth. ghod, what an improvement.

when i first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) and the name "blue monkey", i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie. i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles.... the fx are pretty corny, there isn't too much of a plot, and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. but come on people, what did you expect?? it's not really as bad as it seems.... if you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the updates special fx

never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it, hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. the title on the box said "insect" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. they can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in "blue monkey"! the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. following the always-popular trend of "big-bug" movies, "blue monkey" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. the makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! like i said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. the first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. it is also near the end that "blue monkey" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. "blue monkey" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. fans of b-cinema may recognize john vernon ("killer klowns from outer space", "curtains") in the small and meaningless role of roger, who's in charge of the clinic.

blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. at one point,some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels, exploring. they begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey.yes, thats it. totally inconsequential to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement.i'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose!

oh god,what an idiotic movie!incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot.all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(ha!ha!ha!)...they're simply ludicrous.for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).all in all,this is a great entertainment if you're drunk.avoid it like the plague.am i drunk?i don't think so...

robert altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from edmund naughton's book "mccabe" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don't merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and altman's pacing is deliberately slow. there's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. it's a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****

i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. i can't say that i found much to recommend it. the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. the film looks authentic enough, but something's got to happen for it to work, and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. it just slogs along. flawed as it is, cimino's "heaven's gate" has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again. for a brilliant reconception of the west, hbo's "deadwood" is much superior to "mccabe."

*mccabe and mrs. miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century pacific northwest. into a soggy, muddy mining camp john mccabe (a hirsute warren beatty) comes barging, full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon/whorehouse for the town, replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. he also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger: too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it, but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals. and thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour.it looks to be a rather sorry operation until mrs. miller (julie christie) shows up on a startling contraption that's half-railroad car, half-automobile (where did altman find that thing?). mrs. miller immediately takes on mccabe as a business partner, with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. noting that mccabe doesn't know how to add, she also insists on handling the accounts. it's not clear what mccabe's function will be.the plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer mccabe to buy him out for five grand. mccabe tells them to buzz off -- he's holding out for fifteen thousand. the company finds negotiation distasteful, so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill mccabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as mccabe's function in the whorehouse partnership. (excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local marshal would be pretty tempting.) *mccabe and mrs. miller*, purportedly "classic seventies cinema", should be a lot better than it is. the movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. there are some striking scenes, especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer. but it's really, really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. once again, this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. according to the trivia-sheet here on imdb, the movie's editor griped to altman that the sound was muddy; altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release, altman blamed the editor. (nice.) along with the bad sound, the movie has an atrocious look. only robert altman can hire a world-class dp like vilmos zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. reviewers here who praise the "dark brown glow" of this picture have got to be kidding me. the interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. the exterior photography is even worse: it's as if altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. during the climactic stretch, when beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire, altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a rankin-bass christmas special.look -- i can't watch a movie under these conditions. get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes, when you remove all that annoying "altman-esque" overlapping dialog, and when you wipe the lenses with some windex, or something. 3 stars out of 10.

i watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. the terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. and the sad thing is--internally she dies. eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains. all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit, because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati, ohio. this also was a route for the poor from the mountains.

historically accurate? hmm... perhaps... if you squint, and light falls upon the subject just-so. but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal, patchy and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion. the principal characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the 'enigmatic and noble' american indians through to the 'stuffy but sadistic' british officers. a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history. i want my money back.

how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me. this movie is absolutely terrible. i discovered, after reading some of the other reviews, that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film, which deeply puzzles me, because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution. it's not just that it's a bad movie, with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant, but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded (which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does, though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible. for example, we see donald sutherland running around with a huge, fat ugly mole on his face. he does not normally have a mole. the mole does not add to his character. it is extremely ugly and distracting. it's not like robert de niro's mole; it's much worse. why the hell has he got that mole? it's as if the filmmakers just said, "let's see, how could we make this movie even worse than it already is? i know, let's give mr. sutherland a giant, ugly-ass mole right on his face."another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character ned. we see, for the first three-quarters of the movie, young ned. at one point, "six months later" appears on the screen. we see ned again, and it is, of course, the same actor playing the boy. five minutes later, "three weeks later" appears on the screen, and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned. what, do they think we're idiots? good god! again, it's like the filmmakers are saying, "how can we possibly make it any worse? i don't think we can...oh wait! i just had a terrible idea!" i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year, which is fine, but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks. just don't get another actor to play ned, or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger. furthermore, the kid who plays the "older" ned does not look any older than "young" ned. as a matter of fact, he just looks completely different, much skinnier, and no taller or older than the original actor, which is very confusing, as i, like any rational human being, thought at first that it was a new and different character.what, did the first kid die while they were filming the movie? because he was in it for the first hour and a half, and then all of a sudden, three weeks later, the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie. and even if the original actor did die, the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role, and re-shoot the measly five minutes of "six months later" scenes. better yet, just scrap the movie completely, never finish it and never release, never even tell anybody about it, because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it; it's so bad that you should watch it, just to see how badly it sucks. it's terrible, terrible.

damp telling of the american revolution.when farmer 'tom dobb' (al pacino) and his son arrive in new york harbor, they are immediately conscripted by street urchin annie lennox... annie lennox?... to contribute to the war effort.after getting chopped down by bits of chain-link fired from british cannons, tom and his son are promptly chastised by continental army sympathizer 'daisy' (nastassja kinski) for 'not standing their ground'. following this kodak moment, a series of digressive chapters take place including tom's participation in a 'foxhunt' in which he must carry a model of "poor old georgie washington" stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief-wielding english captain (manning redwood), and having a barbecue with a group of iroquois indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of british officer donald sutherland's butt.director hugh hudson presents a unique style of film-making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial london fog, but the scriptwriter's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals hollywood's patented hatred of the british.steven berkoff appears as an enlisted american soldier.

revolution is a terrible movie, i don't care if you're a history teacher, news writer, al pacino fan, there's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate '10'.the key point to the plot is tom dobb (al) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat. everything revolves around that note. tom's son joins the army to make up for the note, making tom join the army as well, they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army, years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat. the end.it had a few battle scenes, and they were pretty mediocre at best. transistions between scenes used "five months later" and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle. the love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow. so save your "notes" and watch the patriot instead.

this movie was promising: my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war. it had memories from "dances with wolves" for the big prairies, indians, military fights & from "barry lyndon" for the british & candles lights atmospheres...unfortunately, the script is awful: the continuity of the story is lacking (cuts with "5 months later"; "3 years later") & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it: america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other; above all, wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story (imagine the same in "titanic").sometimes, a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker. unfortunately bis, hudson is a poor one. he has already committed "greystoke" and i find again the same flaws: no dynamic in scenes, in editing, in scoring: it is long, dull, flat....i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career: now i understand. finally, this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me: a painful one...

brilliant actor as he is, al pacino completely derails revolution  his method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the american war of independence. much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson (yes, the man who made chariots of fire just a couple of years earlier  talk about a come-down!!). one of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. it's not just al's career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with revolution, more of which will be said later.illiterate trapper tom dobb (al pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of america with his son ned (sid owen/dexter fletcher). he leads a simple life  living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. the country is lorded over by the english colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born. dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the continental army  swept away by events they can barely understand, the dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. tom also falls in love with daisy mcconnahay (natassja kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of british aristocratic ancestry. their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.where to start with the film's flaws? most key actors are miscast  pacino has been criticised enough already, but kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a wobbly yorkshire accent. robert dillon's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. as a result, the narrative falls into no man's land, flitting from "grand spectacle" to "small story" indiscriminately and meaninglessly. john corigliano's score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. hugh hudson's direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. the idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy  that feeling of "being there" in the confusion of battle and musket fire. like so many other things in the film, it doesn't work. the one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. but if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade. nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing british film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s.

worst. movie. ever.what was the purpose of filming this remake (aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie's soundtrack)? zombies that *run*??? i guess the director never watched the original "dead" films, which show stiff-limbed (from rigor mortis) creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey.and how, exactly, did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve?1/10

what the hell is this? its one of the dumbest movies i've seen. i don't understand why people on this site love it so much. its senseless &nudity for no reason. its worst then resident evil. i strongly don't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy, bad acting crap. watch real horor movies such as stephen king's it, the shining, jurassic park(kinda horor), jaws, etc. leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent. it is bad as crudy vs gayson. attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap.oh wow flesh eating zombies. how many damn zobie movies do we need. skip this one.* outta ****

just don't bother. i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and action.but it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. towards the end the it gets better but not really great. i think the director took this movie just too serious. in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. i nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. rating 3/10.derboiler.

the plot is about a female nurse, named anna, is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living. she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. so far, so good! i usually enjoy horror movies, but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror. it's not even thrilling, just ridiculous.even "the flintstones" or "kukla, fran and ollie" will give you more excitement. it's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor. the heroes who has locked themselves in, inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside, are not better either. even though they doesn't seem to be drunk, they give the impression of being mentally disabled. save your money instead of spending it on this!

what a horrible movie. i cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re-make. please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film? mehki pfifer is great in e.r and ving rhames probably didn't know what he was doing. i feel terrible for them. the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film. i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was, could ever distroy such a great classic film. this film should not have been made in the first place. an advice to everyone who has seen it, please tell me that i'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it.boooooo!!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.

when i went and saw this movie, i had great expectations. but i had so wrong. this movie was exactly as every other horror movies. it's a virus, zombies etc. exactly as resident evil and many, many other movies. but the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. it's bad actors and boring music. the photo is ok but the rest is total crap. don't see this "horror" movie, go and see the ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story. i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. we have seen enough of that. the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous, infected celebrities.

funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). what we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and "whoopee" filled 2 hour mtv video. frantic editing, pop-video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blahactually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (chainsaw massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the "who will die next" stakes and a total cash in on the dawn of the dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity...don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? can they really not come up with something original? why remake dawn of the dead? the things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. this is an action flick, plain and simple. the faster the better. if you are into action flicks (and as this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films... get ready to sigh (again)...watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get the godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable pop director is at the moment, and star wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the romero version, not this pap

boy oh boy oh golly gee,the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create mom's "invisibility." they looked like they were shot on cheap video, and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie...i did not end up loving this movie. the attempted "steadicam" shots were really pathetic as well. i mean, hey, if they had a low budget flick, that's fine. you can still make a great movie with a low budget. but, a bad movie and a low budget and effects. that makes for a bad combination. in this case, such a doomed combo created the craptastic film, "invisible mom." if you have kids, and your kids have no taste, perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one.

when this film was released in 1997 the 'special effects', such as they are, were poor. they would have been dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better sfx work. certainly no-one involved in the production of this film was looking for an oscar. it's a wild departure from director fred olen ray's usual stuff, most of which has the word "bikini" in the title (bikini pirates, bikini chain gang, bikini girls from the lost planet, etc) and are little more than t&a flicks, but here we are with a film rated "u" and aimed squarely at the kiddies. you've got to give him credit for diversifying!! this was a minor direct-to-video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels - invisible mom 2 and invisible dad. dee wallace-stone (whose career went downhill fast after 1982s "e.t.) plays the 'invisible mom' of the films title and would return for the sequel. russ tamblyn (whose career had been in free-fall even longer since 1961s "west side story") plays the villainous dr. woorter. it's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month - except maybe young trenton knight as josh. it's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie, this child actor didn't work again after the sequel, "invisible mom 2". maybe the film was cursed. after all, he wasn't that bad in this film. for a child actor, he's pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars.as mentioned above, the "invisibility" effects are naff to say the least, the direction is poor, the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about. there are plenty of worse films out there though, and for anyone under the age of about ten, this film will no doubt be quite watchable. most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though, and i wouldn't blame them one bit!

my title just about sums this heap of crap up i should have taken a hint when i saw it was a fred olen ray movie - but i thought 'hey, it might be better than his usual rubbish' boy, was i wrong! this has to be the worst movie ever targeted at children. the acting was awful, the humour was non-existent, the direction was the worst i have ever seen & the special effects wouldn't seem out of place on a 1950's disney movie.what has happened to dee-wallace stone! who once had such a promising career in the 80's. movie veteran & former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad-guy & the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie.i haven't seen the sequel made in 1999 and nor do i intend toif you want a good kid movie watch 'honey i shrunk/blew up the kids/kid' or any disney moviemy rating as a 19 yo :- 2/10rating as a kid movie :- 3/10 at the best!

we have an average family. dad's a famous rapper, we have the "rebelious teenage daughter", the adopted white kid, and the cute little kid. and we have careless housemaid, what show has had a housemaid like that? do we have a messed-up brady bunch? yay! when it first came out i thought it was really cool, mostly because i was young. the music was bad. the raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. all of his raps were about his family and friends and problems. the dad was kind of the "danny from full house" type of dad. always gave the advice out. but he wasn't a clean freak. they had a house-keeper for that. remember? the plots were basically lil' romeo was in trouble of some sort, or... not that's it. oh and maybe some preteen drama. yeah that stuff is good. not really. but its still a good show for kids. but nikelodean could do better.

my god this movie is awfully boring. i am a big fan of gina gershon, when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama, and some great performance from gershon. gershon is great as always, but she is not right actress for this role, she is too good for rade serbedzija. the romance between gershon and serbedzija's characters is too unconvincing. and i absolutely hated serbedzija's character (a wonman organizer), he is not charming in anyway in the movie. how did dr. lauren graham (gershon) is beyond my comprehension. maybe sean connery, robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role, but they don't have the european-ish looking i guess. any way, i was so bored druing the movie. if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie, check out bound, her best film so far. if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man, try some harrison ford or sean connery movies. gina gershon is so underrated, and she deserves better chance than this, i wish her to make better choice in the future.

this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of deja vu, don't be surprised. all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. and it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with. it never works. and like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre.the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story. had this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile. but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught. i never like this message resulting from a movie.

race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you've driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast till you've driven 250.ok.andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen eraserhead, and eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen begotten.and begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen the works of c. frederic hobbs. race fans, there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c. frederic hobbs.alabama's ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot, and it only involves hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and mystery gas. and the fabulous woodmobile, cruising the sunset district in san francisco, of course.what's really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make alabama's ghost. there's sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. somehow that makes alabama's ghost so wrong. you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby, and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover cards. but alabama's ghost was made with an actual budget, and that's evil. i mean, i've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay, ontario, building a secret temple in the woods out of twizzlers, and nobody's beating down my door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for four of the flakiest movies ever made?

sammy horn (michael des barres) is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in california. he has a lovely wife, grace horn (rosanna arquette), who is pregnant, and a beautiful son of about five years old. sammy indeed loves his family, but like dr. jeckyll and mr. hyde, he has a double life, having sex with many different women. dr. jane bordeaux (nastassja kinski) is trying to help him. ok, it is my fault: i read the summary of the other imdb user comments, i saw the imdb user rating, but i really did not believe that rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski could participate in such a bad movie. i decided to check it, and actually some comments are very complacent. the storyline, the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some x-rated movies we can find more intelligent stories. the photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a vhs camcorder. michael des barres does not have sense of ridiculous: being an old man, bald, would be acceptable in an advertisement of viagra or grandfather of the small boy. but as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman, it is scary. in wood allen's comedy, maybe he got a chance, but in a `serious' movie, it is funny. i am trying to figure out why or how rosanna arquette and nastassja kinski accepted to participate in such awful, amateurish and trash movie. do they need money? lack of chances in better movies due to their ages? are they friends of the `director' (sorry for using this word) and decided to help and promote him? i do not know whether the intention of rosanna arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone, but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script. the same is applicable to the gorgeous nastassja kinki. she is presented fat, without make-up, without any glamour. a total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history. a fact is really intriguing me: how can a reader, without any personal interest, promote this trash, giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie? are they friends of the `director' (again, i am using this word...) or the cast? it sounds very strange to me that a normal imdb reader can like such a film. my vote is two.title (brazil): `viciado em sexo' (`addicted in sex')

this movie could have been a decent b-movie if 3/4 of the the movie wasn't so much focusing on the sex scenes. i mean, he's a sex addict, and i'm sure that there's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis. michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do, which wasn't much. at one point or another, one would have to laugh at him, because his character was so pitiful. nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist, she could've of done more though and i'm not suggesting her having sex. the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife. there's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me. she played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her."diary of a sex addict" while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of.

no reason to bother renting this flick. from the opening credits on, i knew i was in trouble.it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie, but there really isn't anything erotic about it. the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only to a point.boring sex scenes, bad plot, and cameos by ed begley jr. and rosanna arquette aren't enough to save this film.

this movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it. it doesn't give any insight-, or solutions to the problem. it's just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family. why would you want to watch this? it's all so totally pointless and meaningless.it also really doesn't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50+ year old male. you'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him. he just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex. he has all kinds of sexual intercourse's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.it also doesn't have a bad visual style, though it all feels a bit forced. but nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct-to-video productions. who knows, if the film-makers had been given better material to work with, the movie would had deserved a better faith.the story really gets ridicules at times. there are really some pointless plot-lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be. i'm talking about for instance the whole ordell plot-line. things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending. also the whole way the story is being told, cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.but as far as bad movies are concerned, this just isn't one of them. it's not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick, with similar concepts.still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast nastassja kinski and ed begley jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is. guess they were really desperate for work and money.4/10

don't let the title trick you into watching this movie. i read the title, saw that it came on in the middle of the night, and figured it was one of those soft porn movies. this movie is bad. if you like soft porn movies, then i'm sorry to say this isn't one. there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so.

ok, i wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful. as i was waiting another review (for derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie. look at all the positive reviews. they all, i say all, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one. crimminy! and wait till you to the "rosebud" [sic] review.checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. holy window-wipers batman.joe, tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a bad script. no jobs for you!always check positive reviews for a low rated movie!

my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense. (he never reads the synopsis).well, it would be funny if the thing was watchable. it simply isn't. the same thing over and over, no intrigue, and where did they find the leading man?. the leading man, michael des barres, is not even feasibly good-looking, especially for this role he is given. also, sexual harassment at work is something, if you want to see, rent michael crichton's "disclosure". at least michael douglas looked good in the early 90's. alexandra paul, who is usually watchable, plays an embarrassing scene here. there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam. don't even waste time renting this. 0/10.

as many others have stated, this is a terrible movie, from every aspect of movie making. how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing.many people have complained that it was shot on 'cheap' video cameras. yes, it was shot on video, but not 'cheap' video. what made it bad was the lighting, white balancing, shooting technique and editing.there were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess. harsh, inconsistent lighting, over use of hand held shooting (ala woody allen), choppy editing (another allen technique), but poorly done, without real purpose.the lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very amateurish.the simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level.how this video ever made it to print is beyond me. it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is.

i really tried to like this movie. it deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.in this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. in this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.the production values are terrible; mainly the acting. oh, you won't enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.second, the plot is just non sense. how could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? how could she believe him?! the threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". scenes like those you will find plenty. avoid this movie. please, avoid it; it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. it's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.only mrs. kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. i caught it on hbo and i'm glad i didn't spend my money on it. but those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.

this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing. it is shot on video! not film! i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video. it looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. some of the actors give it their best shot. michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. i can't say that it is pleasant to watch.nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. her little girl voice works against her here. and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan. she is certainly ageless and exotic, but she's outside her range with this.alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought. every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?finally, rosanna arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch. but that is not saying much.this has to be the worst film i have seen in years.

i wouldn't normally write a comment on-line, but this is the worst movie i've ever seen. not only that it's filmed just like a soap series ("the young and the restless" is really filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has awful cuts. it has no action. it is full of useless garbage.here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him. so (after loads of crap) here they are: the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like "you're dead now". then the main character says: "if you kill me you're dead. i've told the police you're threatening me". so the (killer) guy goes like (just about to cry): "oh no... the cops are following me!?!! oh... my god".remember: this is just an example. i really cannot believe this movie actually exists. so: if you want to see the worst movie ever... go ahead, i recommend it :)

i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife, tried to turn it off after 10 minutes, but was forced through the whole thing. this must be, hands down, the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever...there were great script moments, such as:sammy - "if she gets over here right away, she gets a bonus" madam - "a boner?" sammy - "no, a bonus"to summarize: horrible script, terrible acting and incredibly illogical.

a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. the bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. if she had, i would have rated this movie a big fat "f." as it is, it rates an f+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "diary of a sex addict" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one hadn't.

i fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching larry sanders (i usually directivo it, but not last night). woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this on hbo2. i was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. seriously. shocked. so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb. this is really really bad. the writing is boring, but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.yes it is shot video. mind you, that is shot on video, not digital video. it does look like a soap opera. the clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror.i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. the shots and blocking are stupid. yes, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not daring, not bold, not boring, just stupid. i know people reviewing this review will say "well give me an example". i cant. it was 3am. but trust me, i know you will watch it anyway, you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.

this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing. it is shot on video! not film! i have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video. it looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. some of the actors give it their best shot. michael des barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. i can't say that it is pleasant to watch.nastassja kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. i can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. her little girl voice works against her here. and i consider myself a nastassja kinski fan. she is certainly ageless and exotic, but she's outside her range with this.alexandra paul is pathetically overwrought. every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. why would michael des barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?finally, rosanna arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch. but that is not saying much.this has to be the worst film i have seen in years.

this movie (not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history. beware: the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction. the film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own warts. the script is pointless and meandering, with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. however, even the sex scenes are lame lame lame. except for the first, they are around three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overwrought.if you are looking for a decent film, you don't want this. if you are looking for a titillating sex-flick, you don't want this. whatever your life's goals, desires, or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie. how they got rosanna arquette, natashia kinski, and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme.

let me first say, i watched this movie around midnight, and usually there only is trash around this hour, but this movie broke the recordfirst of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy, yet he gets to f*ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop, talks to a girl and then you see them f*cksecondly there are loads of sex scenes, and in many of them there is no nudity at all, i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say: fast put your clothes on so we can f*ck!thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash

this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction, but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick. the story revolves around sammy horn (subtle name) played by michael des barres. sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace (rosanna arquette) and a young child. he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree (and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security).the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist (nastassja kinski) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback. this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts, which consumes at least 75% of the screen time.it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad. the production values are abysmal. the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage. the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting, uninspired framing and poor actor direction. the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation. as an example, grace's sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife. his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her. about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more. just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her, `oh, great to see you, gotta run to pick up timmy' and mum's the word about sammy's indiscretions. the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment. no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.the sex depictions are all overdone, mechanical, and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic. most of them are done with both participants fully clothed. the acting is wretched. michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle. he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts, but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski, he is adrift. rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film, giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist, but at least we have some acting happening here. the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like `hit me harder, is that the best you can do?' and `oh, godyes'.this movie is among the worst i have ever seen, a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed. i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10. not to be seen within three hours of any meal.

"diary of sex addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it. bottom line, "diary..." would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world, a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim, and no job in spite of being a restaurateur. at the best, this flick could have been good drama. at the worst, cheap softcore. "diary..." isn't either and nowhere in between. this one's for the dumpster. (d-)

it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. the script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. the costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film, once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. let's just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better! oh, and david thewlis' haircut makes him look like he-man. it does!

this movie has such inexorable b class cheapness to all its scenes, effects etc as to make you think they spent 80% of their budget on connery. it's like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars (quite apart from content).story can be described in one word: flat. and oh my god i can't remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago. we're given neither a reason he's so wicked (an inborn defect, we're lead to think:) nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickedness.if you're out for connery rather go rent `hunting forrester'.

an interesting idea for a film, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together. when he was younger, einon got stabbed in the heart, so bowen (dennis quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart. now grown up einon (david thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. meanwhile, bowen is using a new friend draco the dragon (voiced by sir sean connery) to get rewards for "killing" dragons. but because einon has half of draco's hear, they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt, or killed. also starring pete postlethwaite as gilbert of glockenspur, jason isaacs as lord felton, julie christie as queen aislinn and john gielgud as king arthur. it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects. worth watching!

i had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when i saw it. it was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart. there wasn't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects.

gwyneth paltrow is absolutely great in this movie, but the story is, unfortunately, half-baked, and david schwimmer's energy is sort of like cold mush. when he closes his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what-might-have-been. who thought 25-year-old kiddies would be entertaining?

in a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really wants and tries to be something more. it wants to be harold and maude, annie hall, the graduate. it wants to be deep and human. it has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. the dialog is smart -- at times. there are some "laugh out loud" moments.but here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: 1. david schwimmer -- how many times can joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? maybe some drool would have helped.2. gwenneth paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest. her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like schwimmer has any chance with her. but gwenneth plays her very dull. combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.(i kept picturing someone else in this role -- kate hudson for example.) 3. the script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said "oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!" so they pulled out the hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.

when his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs, a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend, forced to take the rap by the gang, to tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way.the decoy is a real-life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films! it's talky, illogical, slow, and ultimately very boring.there's some good costumes, sets, and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer/director/producer/star justin kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money on his hands.they used to make westerns like this, that were under an hour long. trim this of about half it's length and you might have something watchable.

i chuckled a few times during this movie. i laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover (pun intended).there are three segments in this movie. the first one is supposed to be a spoof of "woman 'grows up' and launches career" movies. the tampax® box was the funniest thing in this segment. most of the cast members aren't listed here on imdb. they are the lucky ones. few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers.the second segment is a spoof of "sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry" movies. robert culp has several funny moments, all physical humor, including the aforementioned handover. after his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as dominique corsaire rises higher and higher. by the time she becomes first lady i wanted to rip the cable out of the tv and watch "snow." i switched to pakistani music videos instead. i don't understand urdu, or whatever language the videos were in. it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull "story."then came "municipalians" with the *big* stars, half of them on screen for less than a minute: elisha cook, jr., christopher lloyd, rhea perlman, henny youngman, julie kavner, richard widmark and ... *robby benson.* it's supposed to be a spoof of "young cop teams with hardened, substance abusing older cop who needs retirement *badly*" movies. the horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive. it was interesting seeing old rtd buses, and a shell gas station sign, and an american savings sign -- none of them are around anymore. nagurski's "never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car" made me smile momentarily. then they discuss how boring the young cop is. a lot. back and forth about how boring he is. that was as boring as this description of how boring it is. nagurski's law number four, "never go into a music store that's been cut into with an acetylene torch," made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave. thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed. young falcone (benson) gets shot. a lot. he becomes a hardened cop like nagurski. the segment keeps going. on and on. and on. it won't stop. it rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he'd just *die* already so this thing will end. it doesn't. it goes on and on and on.... then a "buffy the vampire slayer" episode which i've seen four times already comes on. thank god! this abysmal movie ended while i went to get the mail.

national lampoon was once a funny magazine. whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke-head days of the seventies (when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes) depends very much on your date of birth, but everyone agrees that by the early eighties, middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadn't, and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin-off records shot further holes in the hull. outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence, there's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug. if you make it through the baffling opening segment, 'growing myself', hoping things will get better, tough luck - they don't. whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess. if there's ever a global shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this rambling, incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose.

facts about national lampoon goes to the movies, a.k.a. national lampoon's movie madness:1. the movie is poor, even by lampoon's typical standards. 2. it's not funny. 3. no one goes to see a movie.so, after i finished watching it, i began wondering why on earth it's called 'national lampoon goes to the movies,' and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. it would be like calling austin powers 'an american guy goes to the movies.' how lame. he isn't american, and he doesn't go to movies. none of the characters in lampoon's so-called 'satire' are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000, but it isn't.this was national lampoon's first film after animal house, although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film. poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.i've noticed a pattern. really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category. it has two separate titles -- probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83. 'hmm, movie madness  i've never heard of this movie before! let's rent it!' and then, the realization: 'hey, wait a minute, this is just national lampoon goes to the movies!'it was shelved by mgm/ua, never to be released into theaters or dvd; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade, which is just about the only place you'll manage to find it.it's split up into three stories  a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality/cop-buddy films (i guess). the first segment stars peter riegert (animal house) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff. i'm not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift. until the sex scene popped up.part ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter (don't ask) who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products. ouch! this contains the only funny line in the movie: 'only i can make love with my son!' if you think that doesn't sound very funny, you're right  it's not. and just imagine  it's the highlight of this film!part iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer (christopher lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. it does contain one funny scene but it's extremely over-acted  only lloyd really exhibits any humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. the part where he's choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold, at least, evoked a chuckle or two.it's a shame to watch such a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards. the writers of each segment clearly believe that they're being very ironic and clever by spoofing so-called stereotypes  the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction, favoring the standard t & a instead of plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. it's easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera.the movie isn't funny, as i said before. i laughed once, at only one line, and even then it was a halfhearted one. two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. compared to movie madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.i like national lampoon's vacation series (or, at least three of four installments), and their classic animal house, but their recent slew of direct-to-video bombs such as golf punks (with that great comic genius tom arnold) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago. it gets really old, really fast.sad to see a new film, called gold diggers, is being released with their 'stamp of approval.' it's like condemning a film before it even hits theaters  maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the placedistributor: 'this movie is bad. it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval. that'll teach you not to make something so awful next time.'forget the death penalty. just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month.it's so bad that i can't even begin to explain its putrid vileness. i give up.

wow. i read about this movie and it sounded so awful that i had to see it, and my gosh, i can smell it in st louis. where do i start? national lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of animal house, but they completely missed the mark. i'll go chronologically with these short flicks.short film #1 poor peter riegert (boon from animal house). apparently, he wasn't working back then, so the boys at national lampoons probably called and said "hey, we're making a c**ppy movie, wanna be in it?" peter was like "well, i'm not doing much these days, why not?" he was a great side character in animal house, but he couldn't carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes.possible spoiler the premise is funny enough, with jason cooper (riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she needs to find herself. it's too weird that they're actually in a happy marriage. so he chases her off, there she goes, and cooper is in charge of the kids. this, off course, leads to him burning the house down, losing several of the kids, and sleeping with an assortment of new york bimbos (including an ever so young diane lane). then the wife comes back, wants the kids, and the film ends with a coin flip that'll decide the fate of the children. the idea was actually somewhat clever, but the director stunk. the characters all seem like they're falling asleep, they had to be doped up. sorry boon, your legacy was tarnished with this flop.short film #2 more spoilers enter dominique corsaire. pretty girl, recently finished college, not sure what to do with her life. so she becomes a slut, starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys, takes their money when they die, and she doesn't stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world, fred willard (ooops, i mean the president of the united states). once again, it could have been funny, and though i was happy that corsaire (ann dusenberry in real life) wasn't afraid to bare all, her acting was horrible. what a waste of time.short film #3 i can't believe i made it this far. here's the rookie cop brent falcone (robby benson) with veteran stan nagurski (richard widmark). falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times. nagurski, really, has just given up caring. he watches muggings, assaults, you name it, and never intervenes. he figures the world is lawless and he'll probably get sued if he does anything. even christopher lloyd (at the end of taxi's run) gets in on the action, getting the police called on him, committing a crime, but having his lawyer there to protect him. god bless america!!once again, could have been funny, the performances were intentionally campy, but goodness, no energy whatsoever. henry jaglom and bob giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock. i think the writing wasn't bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the iranian hostage crisis. if i had been a part of this film, i would want my name removed, it's horrible. then again, that's why i watched it.the only good thing about this garbage is that dr john did the film score (repeating "going to the movies" over and over again) and the film isn't much longer than an hour and a half. show this one in film classes with the heading "what you should never do in film-making." this script should have been left on the shelf because yep, it's that bad.

the sun should set on this movie, forever.it goes on forever (which isn't usually a bad thing - the english patient, schindler's list) but is so tedious. the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line which really seems to go nowhere.in short, a waste of talent and film.

back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.one might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. but no -- they are upper class europeans going to college and busy in the social world.never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. all flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.the weakest part of gladiator was the incest thing. the young emperor commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? if movie incest is your cup of tea, then sunshine will (slowly) thrill you to no end.

note to all directors: long is not necessarily good. this movie is incredibly long. however not good. the scenes were drawn out way, way, way, way, way too long. the sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10. it is way below average.some other problems also exist in this marathon. 1) ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree. the guy who played the great-grandfather looks nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality. no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. this one is minor, but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.2) the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous. some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed. the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.3) the love stories in this movie are totally wrong. you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married. then having children. then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us.4) the ending was just bad. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but you won't like it either...unless you are sadistic.the director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis, i mean endless loop, oops they are the same thing. i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie, i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him. long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie. a short description of 'the horse whisperer', and sunshine.sunshine, perfect title. if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave.

this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group (of which i am not a part). i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect - i ultimately found it disappointing. the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional (oftentimes downright "twisted") hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea. an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end. ultimately, pictures such as this are about the human condition - this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets.

from the opening dialog and scenes, i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck. didn't want to look, but couldn't turn away. if it weren't for the meer eye candy of this film, i would have given one star. the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.if you were stuck out in the woods, your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do?a.) run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. b.) have sex with your friends girlfriend. c.) take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. d.) bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel. e.) all of the above.according to eli roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. in fact, all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever. the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. stay away. stay far away.

no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed. i wish i could get my time back. nice skull face broad really smiles, bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script. i was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end, especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset. eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption. overall, i found most of it pointless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the demise of cast, in a way though, wishing that journey never happened (probably should've been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night, ugh).

sure i've seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater. i wanted my money back. i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course i didn't receive a refund (or even a reply) but it's the point that matters. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a -42. why did the "jeep" (chevy blazer??) stop running from being hit with a bat? why did they hit the "jeep"(chevy blazer?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum's skull? the plot was thin, the movie filled with obvious clichés, and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense.

this film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. one of the friends catches a horrifying flesh-eating virus. suddenly, the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves."cabin fever" is a horrible film. for one, it tries to be many genres at once. is it supposed to be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy, or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? nobody can tell. there's a serious scene at first and a second alter, it turns funny. when the film tries to be funny, the humor is quite bland, excluding the ending. i liked the ending a lot.but apart from the ending, i was pretty disappointed and disgusted. the violence is cringe-worthy, more looking away from the screen than being scared. the tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. in fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. what are we supposed to get from that? this same girl would bite one of the characters. was that supposed to be funny? i don't know.some of the performances were decent, and many were quite amateurish. i didn't care for most of the characters. i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly. as a horror film, i didn't know what it was trying to be. i didn't find it funny, tense, nor scary. by the end, you're left indifferent, thinking, "what have i just been through?" unfortunately, you'll never know the answer to that question.

there's a major difference between releasing an original, intense, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing like filmmaker eli roth and his team have done with "cabin fever" and simply acted like it. the film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, flesh-eating disease. it's not long before the friends turn on one another, and can barely stand the sight of one another, much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. as gross as it all sounds, there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director roth. this is sloppy film-making in several ways! avoid this time devourer.

wonderful actors. lousy script and not too great direction either. my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people. not the killer not the victims. the settings were pretty drab. dennis quaid's character was so poorly written in, i didn't even care when the end came. he got his kid back. big deal! i wanted my money back.

i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly. danny glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. i'd watch it again though. i rated it a 5 (wish i could rate it a 5.5)

i didn't mind the film that much, but it was incredibly dull and boring. a few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for. you should give it a go if you like silly, stupid humour because this is the film for you.

this may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life, and i want it back!chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies. some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. there's not much middle ground in this category. although chris farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then not so funny, and then dead...so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.avoid this movie like the plague.c

chris kattan is a great sketch actor on saturday night live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. he plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. wanna know the only funny parts? the stuff they showed in the previews. yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. nothing else is. especially when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. and yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. this movie made me develop an eye twitch. avoid it at all costs, and keep watching snl.

admittedly, i didn't have high expectations of "corky romano." but then again, who did? however, i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt. i had no high hopes of "joe dirt" either--another recent comedy starring an snl cast member--and i ended up being pleasantly surprised. but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews. chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor--contrary to what you might think after watching this movie--with great energy. he's been in many hilarious snl skits, and i think he's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now. in this case, he's given a lame, pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging. throughout each scene, he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably. jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy, not to mention he worked with much better writing. kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes. he doesn't even wait for the punchline; he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack. in one scene, he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth. the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him. he comes back to the job, strung out on coke. now, how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on-edge, when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film? as for the rest of the cast members...vanessa shaw is really hot, peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn. peter falk is also wasted, though he has a few funny lines that i'm pretty sure he improvised. i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon. that's too much talent too waste on a clunker like "corky romano." i didn't like falk's last movie "made" all that much either, but at least he had a decent role. i chuckled a few times, but i could not get a single laugh. each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. and it's made worse by kattan's hammy acting. and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out. for example, when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces. he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes, trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one. it's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out, but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse. and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust. i can go on and on about what's wrong with this so-called comedy, but i'm not gonna waste my time. like i said earlier, if you predicted bad things from the trailers--you predicted right. my score: 3 (out of 10)

don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. the problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. even worse, the set-up is never explained. you will leave the theater asking "is that it?" i rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. there are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. let this one come out on video before wasting your money.

everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful. i wasn't going to comment, but the film just bugs me so much, and the writer/director in particular. so i must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.i saw the original "wicker man" and really loved the cornucopia of music, sensuality, paganism in a modern world, and the clash of theological beliefs. this said, i am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done. for example, i liked the original 1950's "invasion of the body snatchers", but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake. both films can stand on their own. another example is "the thing". the original, as campy as it looks compared to today's standards, has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with kurt russell (my all time favorite horror movie). so that small minority of people who like "the wicker man" re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it's a re-make.this film solidified for me neil labute's sexism and misogynistic tendencies. it also made me wonder how executives, wanting to make a serious thriller, would green light a product that is so anti-female. there are too many scenes of cage hitting women just because he's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl. would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming? the original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a goddess based religion. the threat to the main character came from everyone, male and female. there was no sexual hierarchy.the metaphor of bees, drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ("the drone must die!"), especially when cage's character has bee allergies. i kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts. these were not women with special supernatural powers, and half of them seemed to be pregnant, the other half old and fat, and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs, so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women. physically dominate them. there didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy. but if they were content being drones, why make them unable to speak? they could be used as a threat to cage because they will defend the community. they are drones because neil labute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated. (that movie was made already. "the stepford wives" anyone?) classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.the problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when cage starts knocking women out. i belief labute should've left the society an egalitarian one, kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness, and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island. no one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited. so how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around? there would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused, thus, an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children. labute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give cage's character an incentive to search. i don't think you need that. any child abused will make an adult react to save them. the irony of course would be that the child cage "saves" ultimately brings him death.the dialogue was contrived and campy. the whole third act was hilarious. the audience i saw it with guffawed (and later booed at the end). i just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded cage is. we don't need that. just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child. most of us in america have seen "law & order" and other cop procedurals. we come into the movie as if we are cage's partner solving a mystery.so much potential...wasted. neil labute, stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort. stay with your own company of men. leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers. here is your jar of honey. i'll watch that.

this film was terrible. ok, my favourite film is 'the wicker man' (1973), so i was always bound to be a little biased. the plot rambles along, throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (he's not a virgin, but is allergic to bees. wow!) so many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained, which i'm afraid mr labute does not a horror movie make. (how are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film?) cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout, and his character is prone to calling out "rowan!?" at the slightest noise. the 'nods' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage. for example, certain incidents mirror the original (the girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when woodward/cage is searching the island) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from anthony schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.i'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this, i really can't be bothered to write any more about this film. it lacks any kind of substance. throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were 'based' on (in this case very loosely).

what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie. a remake that did not need to be retold. everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments. worst movie i ever saw. save your time and money!!!nicgolas cage was biking down hills, swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.although a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. don't they get a copy of the script first. if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd.

i recently saw the broadway revival of "blithe spirit" starring angela lansbury, rupert everett, christine ebersole, and jayne atkinson. it's a terrific production, and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect. angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati.it was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison. the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production."blithe spirit" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. the actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house, or with a dvd showing, where the audience is separated from the story by the "fourth wall." the story: charles condomine (rex harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife ruth (constance cummings) in a house in the english countryside. seeking information for his next book, a book dealing with the supernatural, charles invites madame arcati (margaret rutherford, reprising her role from the original 1941 london production), a local spiritual medium, over to his house to conduct a séance. charles believes that spiritism is a sham, but hopes to pick up "the tricks of the trade." but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira (kaye hammond), charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles (complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira).on stage, the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation. but on the screen, the actors in "blithe spirit" tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them. they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage. the performances by harrison, cummings, and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless. only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati.the oscar-winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. but compare the dull visual effects of "blithe spirit" to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's "song of the south" -- which was eligible for awards the same year. in "south," humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. compared to "south," the oscar that "blithe spirit" received for special effects was completely undeserved.at any rate, i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes. as for the movie with rex harrison, skip it.

the title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often. most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but i would like to welcome alone in the dark to the short list of real candidates: plan 9 from outer space, battlefield earth, and the adventures of pluto nash.as i watched the 90 minute bore i found it difficult to even stay awake even while i was trying so hard to laugh at the film. but alas i felt alone in the dark (i was gonna try to avoid the pun but i couldn't resist) as i looked around hoping to see mike nelson and his two robot friends. alas my friends and i had to provide comedy throughout the film.so... about the film itself. lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film. the film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the xenos in aliens (they even call them xenos), and the creatures in pitch black. the can turn invisible at random (and i assure you it is random) and get hurt by light. also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie. all of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. the action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow. people shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post. light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.and those were the high points. the story revolving around a paranormal investigator (slater) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater tshirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. an archaeologist (reid) who is rather inept. and a government agent(dorff) whose lines involve barking order. all three should be ashamed at their performances (not that they have really ever done a good a job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. reid and slater are supposed to be lovers in the film i guess. the film contains the single most awkward love scene i have ever seen on film between the two.then comes the plot. quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. the rest is illogical at best. the plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. the film begins with text and a voice explaining the back-story. this opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible. this opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film. and the ending did not make one ounce of sense. not only did it not make sense in the world of the film, it simply did not make sense.finally the direction of one uwe boll. disgrace, thats all that can be said. his use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense. his lack of direction with the actors. just watch reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot. the complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects. and finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.i payed a $1.50 to see this show at a second run theater. and while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter i would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film. grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.shame on you uwe boll. shame on you tara reid. shame on you christian slater. shame on you stephen dorff. shame on anyone who was associated with this film.

this should be my kind of movie. even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, i like "congo," and "allan quatermaine" movies. i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place.1. horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. i'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. super-natural enemies with quality fx. 4. christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy. 5. tara reid is hot.so this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do...i mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. but now on to some of the many faults.tara reid. even though the movie as a whole is worse, reid's performance is truly awful. we're not just talking bad, i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year. i don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. i mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.even with reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd, otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time. the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, i guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during. the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a "chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities." i may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, slater and dorf to try to save everyone.jesus, i can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements. the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth. i mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. i guess he's infected? how did that happen? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. how the hell did that happen? why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which "fuse" with the spine of their host)of course, slater is, like blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug "didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock," thank god. oh, and the people with these "fused" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. yeah we get zombies.so lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.

i expected a comedy like the "big mama" movies. instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story.this movie has three plots: the first involves madea and her taking in a foster child. the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her. the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.there is actually very little comedy in the movie. there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. for example, madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comedic manner), to convince the child to straighten out. the child does, in fact, turn herself around. apparently, it pays to beat children.there are plots dealing with child rape (with the consent of the mother). there are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (the ogling takes place at a family reunion.) the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off-balance. is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? it is, in fact, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.

i saw the movie last night here at home, but i thought it was too long first of all. second, the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before. the things isn't funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend, beatings. the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry, you can do better then this!

the original show was so much better. they should have left on a good note. this movie killed the whole idea. it was boring, over-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack. this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel. not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. so, sorry, tyler perry, but try harder next time. this movie is just kinda dull, and not that funny either. sorry. 4/10 stars is it.jay addison

i'm a black man living in a predominantly black city. that being said, i have some major misgivings about tyler perry's work. i realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him, because he's black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture. but, i honestly do believe that, were perry white, this film would have had the naacp, al sharpton, and jessie jackson all over his ass.i have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil. the characters are poorly written and acted. the jokes are so bad, i have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny. i'm just going to break this big pile of sh-t down.madea=suck. the character may have had some appeal, but it doesn't anymore. when the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless. she is unnecessary.the situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh-t. if a woman was so scared to death of her husband, why would she try to run away when he's sleeping in bed. wouldn't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. at any rate, the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that i hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.then there are the two lovebirds. a bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he's making his rounds. i couldn't believe it. i really couldn't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. but, what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. i don't use this term lightly, but that woman only had two modes. morose victim and psycho momma. no matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was one constant. the bus driver wasn't going to get any. he even married her without sampling the goods--wtf! then there's the family reunion scene. here we've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos, grinding for the sake of grinding, shirtless, overly musclebound, b-ball, plus the great taste of maya angelou. when those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, was i wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack. all this crap is going on at the reunion, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell. when they do, everyone drops what they're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too, just like a pack of pavlov's doggies--wtf!! then you have the final five minutes of the film. in it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress. there is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling--wtf!!! the only reason to watch it this far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well. guess what, it doesn't happen. instead, perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe, ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness--wtf!! i'm pretty sure that, if given a day , i could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. don't even get me started on the rest of tyler perry's films. i'm just going to say this. in my opinion, as a black guy, d.w. griffith's legacy lives on. the irony is that it is doing so through a black man who will be praised for doing what birth of a nation did, selling us down the river. i only wish perry's films were dudes so i could kick them in the nuts. thanks a lot, dude!! what are you going to follow this up with in 2009, a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in colonial america?

a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. the name of the female assassin is sawa. she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal, akai, who is sleeping with her. one day sawa finds out he killed her parents..------- even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest. "kite" has style, but it is still trash. the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time, only causing the story to fall flat on it's face. one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful. not only that, the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy.grade: 3/10

well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex (which can sometimes be fun, too, but it's not in this case). what else can i say about this...? the action, when happening, is inventive and there's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several miles high), but overall there's not much to recommend "kite". watch it if you want, but you're not missing much if you skip this one...

(spoilers)i shoulda figured. the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was. i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen. this one is much worse. makes no sense. thrown together plot. all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them. it had to of been a student film. that musta gotten a c grade2/10quality: 1/10 entertainment: 6/10 (until i found out it wasn't going to end.) the ending made no darn sensereplayable: 0/10

the same night that i watched this i also watched "scary movie 4," making for one messed up double feature. unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise. while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. how could i desire any more than that. director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. the script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. i, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. and that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. some may giggle, i did not. they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny, and i thought all hitler jokes were funny.the narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain. tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today). oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance. and when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. but that is just the way the world works. in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: taco bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect. and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago. there are a few good chuckles to be had. the last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb. i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there. and by "there" i mean to the level of "scary movie 4." **1/4

with a title like "attack of the killer tomatoes!", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. it's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.you're never supposed to take this movie seriously, i realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal, superman walking by lois, etc.). "attack of the killer tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "attack of the killer tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.there is one good actress in the entire thing: sharon taylor as lois fairchild. she is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. unfortunately, she is put to bad use here."attack of the killer tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "amazon women on the moon" or "kentucky fried movie", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so i would still recommend seeing it once. avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly "lost" footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect (it can be found in english on the out of print tape).

the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume: "can somebody please pass the ketchup?" i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative; it works better than an overdose of demarol.

never see this movie.it tries to be a spoof on scifi/thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it.it is very lame. a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it. this movie does not have any such aspect.save yourself. it's too late for me but... just don't watch it.

"attack of the killer tomatoes" consists mostly of rambling, poorly assembled footage in search of a movie. the plot makes no sense, and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all. watching this silly spoof, you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately: that it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality film and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality (in one scene, female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them; how far can "suspension of disbelief" go - even in a parody?). the title song is great, though. (*1/2)

this movie's heart was in the right place, no matter where its brain was."attack" is basically a spoof a la "airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack.through all manner of film magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors), the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp. then, it's up to mason dixon (miller) and a group of spies i wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day. of course there's a meddling reporter (taylor) who pops in at the worst times, dancing and singing army soldiers, japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices, some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword...and oh yeah, the san diego chicken before he made it big.the gags here aren't all that great. in fact, you could probably make up better yourself after watching these. some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ("please pass the ketchup" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) and as far as "puberty love" goes...well, i can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.what's good about it? well, i liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed. ...that's about it.three stars. not a "killer" comedy, but it tries.rock on, peace.

attack of the killer tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. the (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. the actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. there's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. he's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. this movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. the movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. at one point, a giant wax tomato "slides" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! maybe i would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie. 2/10

i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so i went into it with that expectation. i just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. it could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.

awlright, damn it, the moocow will grudgingly admit the truth: i kinda' like this cheap, cheesy 70's parody. the idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. this film, along with the kentucky fried moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 80's & 90's, thanks largely to airplane!. this one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. but thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the obnoxious "puberty love" song, and the awesome helicopter crash scene, attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. there are sooooo many things wrong with this film...and so right, it's hard to explain. enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!! large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull. and dig those 70's clothes, dude!! ;=8) this tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; the moocow says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes!! :

yes, it can be done. john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , sc-fi musical. if there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. every cheap cliché thought of is used. no doubt a fun movie to watch. worth a cold six-pack or two. point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. san diego is a good place as any to start. scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace. this cult favorite features: david miller, eric christmas, al sklar, tom coleman, sharon taylor and john qualls.

i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it. however, i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy. other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type. however, just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make. granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie, nothing to be taken seriously, however, you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie. perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good. the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer, but no they indeed made a full movie, and a rather weak one at that.

when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it, i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes! sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.led by detective dick mason, a special team of military and scientists (including greg colburn who never takes his scuba outfit off and lt. finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind) 'attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of b-movies, in particular japanese horror of the 1950's. the film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady, and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses! to be fair there are a couple of funny moments, for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent, or when disguise expert sam smith infiltrates the tomatoes 'hey, can somebody please pass the ketchup?'. equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept. unfortunately for 'attack of the killer tomatoes' spoof films such as the 'airplane' and 'naked gun' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.the acting is atrocious; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy. for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once, one gag after the over. the singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre, even for this film. ultimately, however, you can see why this film is a cult one; i can't see many people being indifferent to it. unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up.

in case you're a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making, there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch "attack of the killer tomatoes". it's an inescapable certainty, as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made. one tiny but essential detail, however, is that "attack of the killer tomatoes" is deliberately awful. right from the opening message already, mocking alfred hitchcock's "the birds", this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and i can't escape the impression that writer/director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit. the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called "eco-horror" movies (plants, animals and nature in general revolting against humanity) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines. a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country. the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy, which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices. the first half hour of "attack of the killer tomatoes" is very entertaining. as silly as it is, the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny. the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song, the "jaws" homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash (see the trivia section for more details) that made it to the final cut. after that, however, the whole thing turns into a tedious, unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess. the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots. personally, i prefer the late 80's and early 90's sequels (which i saw before seeing the original) because they benefit from slightly better production values, incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin ("the addams family") as the mad scientist dr. gangreen. but, as said before already, the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life.

the easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. the target of the satire is quite vast, from the us government to corporate america. it is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.think of this movie as a mix between the kentucky fried movie, airplane and police squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. i can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. i see this movie as a big influence on tim burton's mars attacks.the plot is simple enough. genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities. at first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.the movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : lois "fairchild" (a lois lane clone), a very ambitious presidential press secretary, clark kent, mason dixon (fia agent who hasn't worked since the bay of pigs), a useless president (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack new york), an even inept congress, a sleazy marketing ceo, and mason's team consisting of an obese east german "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed wwii paratrooper and an african-american disguise expert (disguised as george washington, abraham lincoln, hitler and finally as a tomato). did i also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? there are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.on top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. they aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. the best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("attack of the killer tomatoes"). it is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. be warned.most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. i don't believe i was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. i definitely recommend this movie for fans of b and c grade movies, but only as a rental.-celluloid rehab

there aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. every one is a welcome addition to the genre. although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good, matthias freihof (philipp) looks real good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. it is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(east berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. in a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `last exit to brooklyn :the book not the film).but it is unremittingly depressing and slow in a contrived way that evoked an old sctv send up of ingmar bergman. it is so sloppily edited i wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before the wall came down and yes, life behind the `curtain' was hard for gay people. a good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses.

the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic (worst pun by far: "guess what? this time i heard you coming"). the stars are a mismatched pair: brandon lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). note to the director: in the future, please stay away from any love scenes, especially when your main actress won't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double. (*1/2)

extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden dolph lundgren and brandon lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. the action is at best average, a bit of nudity chucked in and yes tia carrera does use a body double! the set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case, the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making lundgren the cop with oriental values and lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical, lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. the action sequences are by the numbers and lee(who would go on to make the excellent the crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. but given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in the crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think cobra etc.) then avoid.poor 3/10

well, i couldn't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values. it's a b-movie action-flick, by the director of "commando", that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good b-movie with enough entertainment value in it.it's an '90's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an '80's action movie, when these type of b-movies were at an all time high. these movies always went over-the-top and never paid much attention to its story or acting. it was all about blowing stuff up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. this movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet i really didn't liked watching this movie as much as i like watching some similar type of movies. hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.it's probably because the movie is being often far too silly. all these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it. the fighting, dolph lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the story. it all just isn't very good because it's often just too lame for words. the story at times isn't even trying to make a bit sense and what's even the main plot-line of the overall movie? its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences, gun fights and such. and those sequences aren't even much good to watch really. the moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really, from the man who brought us "commando".it's foremost a dolph lundgren, in which he gets to play the big action hero star, who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by tia carrere. this all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence i have seen in any movie really. both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.none of the characters work out really. the good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. they simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest, or to inform anyone about their discoveries. not even when they find out a big japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of l.a. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling. and also just think about it for a moment, what is brandon lee's overall purpose in the movie? the movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well.too silly, lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough.4/10

seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. i watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren, and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors, and i found the movie so awful that it was funny. then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie ever.lungren beats out his previous efforts in "the punisher" and others, as well as all of van damme's movies, seagal's movies, and stallone's non-rocky movies, for this distinct honor. this movie has the absolute worst acting (check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (dolph in full japanese attire). picture "tango and cash" with worse acting, meets "commando," meets "friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.the good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.an awful, awful movie. fear it and avoid it. if you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.a bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. dolph friggin' lundren with a japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching "showdown," had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. there are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. brandon lee and dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, brandon says to dolphy, "in case we don't make it, i want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- i've ever seen."now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? in an action film no less? and would you want those to be your _dying words_??later, there's this gem:dolph (regarding the villain): "i would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy." brandon: "man, you've got a fixation." as the guy at ruthlessreviews.com pointed out, "unfortunately, dolph doesn't respond with, 'i've got a fixation? i've got a fixation?! you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates! i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose, man."this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. it's about on par. great fun for the whole family!

*** warning - this review contains "plot spoilers," though nothing could "spoil" this movie any more than it already is. it really is that bad. ***before i begin, i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so-incredibly-bad-that-you-fall-over-laughing movies. if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh, this is the movie for you. now without further ado, my review:this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal-mart. that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is. secondly, it stars the lame action-star dolph lundgren. that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is. i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd (who would waste their money doing such a thing?), though as you might imagine, there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd. in fact, there's not even a menu; the movie just starts playing.first, the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed. it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one-liners; remarkably unbelievable, fake dialogue; and inappropriate comments (like lee's comment on lundgren's. err. manhood, which i'll mention later). there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie. the dialogue and plot go hand-in-hand, as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion. the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning, and then for again no reason at all, lee's character pulls over to the side of the road, runs around to the other side of the car, and says `i'm not going to let you go alone, 'cause despite myself, i like you! and i don't want to see you get killed!' . or something to that extent, anyhow. there are disgusting one-liners, mostly said by lee. for instance, when duking it out with a bad guy, lee says `you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to be dead!' lastly, i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about lundgren's nether-regions. when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and carrere, and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear, lee says to him: `incase we die, i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy.' . yes, he actually says that. it makes no sense and isn't even possible (lee never actually sees lundgren naked, so how would he know?), but the writer threw it in the script anyway. the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game, and lee even admits it. after lee and the underwear-only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys, lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful: `wow, this is sort of like a video game; we just defeated the first wave!'second, the plot of this movie is despicable. it suffers, in my opinion, mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist. the trailer for this movie - which imdb has available for viewing, by the way - makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese yakuza from taking over lost angeles. this is extremely misleading, however, since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all. they make very brief, vague references to the yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers, but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly-written attempt for kenner (lundgren's character) to revenge the death of his parents, whom the yakuza leader (named yoshida) killed when he was only 9 years old. the entire plot can basically be summed up like this: yoshida wants kenner dead, kenner wants yoshida dead, and the two try two kill each other. and of course all the while kenner's sarcastic sidekick (named johnny and played by brandon lee) acts like an ignorant idiot, and tia carrere gets naked. twice.the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie. the dialogue is so unrealistic, and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more. you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway, but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.finally we get to the heart of the movie's baseness: the flagrantly bad action. there are so many astoundingly bad, unrealistic action sequences in this movie, it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in. although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well, most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren. for instance, lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one-handed, without spilling his tea. then, when surprised by an oncoming speeding car, lundgren casually leaps over it. or how about when he reaches through a closed door, grabs the villain on the other side, pulls him back through the door, and beats him up? or when he picks up tia carrere, gently walks (not runs) backward through a glass door that shatters around him, and leaps down a one-story height with tia still in arm, only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets? all of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well, with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy instantaneously, while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them. that is, of course, until the final fight scene of the movie. lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart, would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds. despite this, lundgren remains in top-notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with yoshida, the evil super villain. and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real, fully sharpened katanas, which the two use to sword fight. now in addition to his bullet wound, lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms. does this stop him? no, of course not! in fact, a few seconds later after easily killing the evil yoshida (who gets pinned to a dartboard-like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason), lundgren casually walks off with tia and lee as if he wasn't injured at all. god, it's terrible.all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary, gratuitous nude scene every five minutes, including topless women at a party, the beheading of a topless woman, women at a strip club, nude women at a japanese spa, and the pointless hot tub and love scene with tia. not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar, at which rich japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women. which, by the way, prompts lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and lundgren will `go eat fish off those naked chicks!' which, of course, is followed by a disturbing high five. and we can't forget the terrible editing either, like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard, and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy. the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers, which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all.in the end, this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness. it is illogical and impossible, and as a result, remarkably entertaining. if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema, this movie will make you want to die. if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making, this movie will delight you. as an actual movie, i'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10. as an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes, however, this beauty takes the cake.

i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable, i can see why it hasn't been rebroadcast anytime recently. more specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as:1) it is terribly miscast. the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. ali mcgraw (45 at the time) was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26. jan-michael vincent (39 at the time) was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22. the other henry children, and pamela tudsbury, were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.2) some of the acting was absolutely awful. ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable. i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays. 3) the directing was poor. to be fair to ali mcgraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the directing. the portrayal of hitler was way overdone. his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel. some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (berel jastrow) they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them.4) this mini is very dated. the hokey music, the pretentious narration (it sounded like a junior high school history film narration), and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times. also, too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all, because it will come off more as a late 70's / early 80's "take myself too seriously" prime-time soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic.remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable, and critically acclaimed production. i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public, it wouldn't fly.

the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli defence force come across a terrorist base . this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script , it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of david bannon as he rents a room from abby and russell quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is . however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that i`ve seen

it's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. well, in this case, not only the movie is not "as good" as the book, but is an insult to the book. i'd rather see milan kundera's novel turned on fire than into this "something," which the director probably calls "adaptation."all the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?" is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is daniel day lewis' (i cannot say tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. françois truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. don't waste your time and money. read the book instead, it's really worth it.

oh, i heard so much good about this movie. went to see it with my best friend (she's female, i'm male). now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream. after the first couple of dozen "take off your clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom. we laughed (at it, not with it), we dozed (and would have been better off staying in bed), we were convinced we had spent money in vain. and we had. the plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care. a waste of money, a waste of celluloid. this movie doesn't even deserve one out of ten votes, but that's the lowest available. i'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent; i don't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence.

this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i don't care what the critics say, it's bad. i think the problem is with kundera's novel. it's not that it's unfilmable; it's just that like 99% of his work, it's pretentious and overdrawn. he seems to be enamored with himself,his characters come off as navel-gazing, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. i have read many of his works (even his socialist realist poetry. that was truly awful) -- i just don't understand what the fuss is about. characteristics (like the self-absorption) in his novels make for infuriating reading. in a movie, all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified. maybe i just missed something, but i don't think so. on a side note, i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd. no way is this movie that essential.

yeah cheap shot i know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' (political turmoil, love/lust) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim (see also 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene i counted three different 'generic european' accents affected by the actors) and displays of state might run amok, yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered. and in its over-long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz,the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot, and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs. it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overweening soundtrack, these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content.

harsh, yes, but i call 'em like i see 'em.i saw this in the late 80's, and it was truly one of the most awful, boring films i've ever forced myself to watch.yes, the cinematography is lovely. the czech settings are truly stunning. the political backdrop is enticing, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (e.g. _dr. zhivago_ (qv)), this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story, or even interesting.sure, olin and binoche are beautiful. but this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes plodding and slow. i'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery.i'm sure if i'd read the book, the story would have made a bit more sense. however, life's too short to expend any more time on this one.

seriously, why do american and frech actors pretending to be czechs need to speak perfect english with a fake russian accent? i am a man, so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity--but a soft porn flick would have more of that, and at least wouldn't pretend it's artistic.all the political statements where painfully didactic- has the director heard of subtlety? the acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never funny. the characters were very shallow, and i just couldn't identify with them at all.the bit where i did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage-just ludicrous.i read many of kundera's short stories (not the unbearable lightness of being), and there are good things about his style of writing (although his themes are one big male fantasy)-and i have to say, the film did not convey any of the goodness of kunderas style.

this film is quite boring. there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed.the best thing about the movie is lena olin--she does a masterful job handling her character, but day-lewis garbles most of his lines.kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. the incongruities in bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. character attitudes change without explanation throughout. badly disjointed.

after reading the book, which had a lot of meaning for me, the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed. this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else.either that or he is simply bad. most importantly where is the lightness?! from the very first scene, music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling, and this continues right through the movie. i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie, this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here. instead the music manages to give everything that 'movie feel', in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them, so that everything actually feels heavy.another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic. in the movie we see franz passing tomas on the street, who is on his way to see sabina. the introduction of this chance meeting/passing, which im sure didn't happen in the book, gives tomas' story more significance than it does make it light.there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed, imo for the worst, however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie, such is kundera's style. this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film. a film which is as long as it is uncompelling. for those who haven't read the book yet i recommend just reading that. for those who have, i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings.

*** contains spoilers ***i did not like this movie at all.i found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? in a "light" way, like tomas; in a "heavy" way like tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like sabina? how much is fidelity important in a relationship? how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our country?unfortunately, i haven't read kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will: i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.i disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. i simply don't see the reasons why. what i see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.1) the three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.2) the "secondary" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.3) i did not like how tomas was impersonated. nothing is good for him. he is so self-centered and selfish. he is not human, in some sense. but when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, i did not find the interpretation credible.4) it's very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. on top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?5) the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable. and i am not even mother tongue. moreover, the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech, which i found very inconsistent.6) many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered: i guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good.7) i found the ending sort of trivial. tereza and tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the "metropoly", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. but they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. so what? had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? i don't think so. i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.8) the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. you see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. you don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.9) i hated the "stop the music in the restaurant" scene (which some comments praised a lot). why sabina has got such a strong reaction? why franz agrees with her? i really don't see the point. the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. that's it. what's so special and unique about it?after all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot (that's why i gave it a two).the "naked women photoshoot", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presented.the other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians. tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. i found it quite original and tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally "designed" in such a way that "tomas types" are going to like it and "tereza ones" are going to hate it. if this is the case (i strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.

i think phillip kaufman read the cliff's notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film. okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. this film does not even try! the one dream sequence of tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, daniel day-lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this (i know it's not really a valid complaint, but hey). a perfect example of the hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature.

another great movie by costa-gavras. it's a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics. the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in coups and support of latin american dictatorships.despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the cold war era. costa-gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. for example he presents the us actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive.as it turned out it was a blessing for uruguay and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved. europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes. i never heard of poor uruguayan or chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most east european countries. the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated. it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. this is not an idealistic world as costa-gavras and matamoros like to believe. had matamoros come to power in uruguay, we would've had another ukraine in latin america.all in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct.

hanna-barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. the violence is watered down, the stories are formulaic, the animation is bad, the music is obnoxious and repetitive, and frankly, the show just isn't funny.at the time, h-b put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations, regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not. thus, popeye and bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("hey! popeye is popular, and the flinstones are popular. put 'em together, and you can't miss!"). also, in an apparent ripoff of "private benjamin," olive oyl and the goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits. seriously! why? adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons, but still annoying). popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (i swear i'm not making that up.)the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack mercer, the voice of popeye from the early days, continues the role here.worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old fleischer shorts. otherwise, avoid at all costs.

popeye and big foot **; popeye's engine company **; getting popeye's goat **1/2i used to lap these up as a kid but, catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back-to-back now i.e. several years later (they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas [1953]), i can see how they don't hold up all that well! the character of popeye isn't exactly sympathetic to begin with, olive oyl distinctly overbearing and bluto's antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot. they're strictly juvenile fare, yet i doubt today's kids would even have the patience to stick with them!; furthermore, the animation style is unattractive.taking each short per se, i guess they improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were, so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief (hardly original, i know, but always an amusing ploy). one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience.

... mainly because ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes, that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film. ho-hum. i found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff! - not to mention dull, having to watch it all over again.ok, that complaint aside, the byline for ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie, which frankly, over 36 minutes, simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline.there are, however, some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been, had it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered.so in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story, go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes.

this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure, and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it, and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! admittedly, the storyline was decent...but i found the acting terrible! the exception was marianne jean-baptiste, i thought her performance was wonderful. she was the only highlight, without her, i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film. every time i hear somebody say "daarling" i cringe! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said "it". it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life!(i apologise if this has offended anybody, i am only expressing my opinion)

i have seen a lot of movies...this is the first one i ever walked out of the theater on. don't even bother renting it. this is about as boring a soap opera as one can see...at least you don't have to pay to watch a soap opera, though.

"horrible people" ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film. if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out of your window at real life. but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things, you'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh. the characters talk at length, but never actually manage to communicate with each other. why not? presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. but we're not, and he failed.

well, eyeboy, i must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me, especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do. my favorite part of your post was "but no big bang-bang good-guy bad-guy here, kimosabe. me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang."well said! i do like action movies, especially if they are well done, but i also like movies that don't have a whole lot of action, as long as they are well done. i'm sorry, but secret's and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie. i really don't see very many non-american films, so maybe i was spoiled, and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies. perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb. hmm... if true, that is very scary.jeremy barger bits@midohio.net(new e-mail)

first of all there wasn't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really. it wasn't a bad movie, just another movie where i said "well, that wasn't anything special" after i'd seen it. there was probably drama and stuff, but it simply didn't grab me, but more seamed semi-dull. as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way. the quality of the film itself (the images) seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv-movie than a well respected english film-maker. the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion. didn't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. i haven't seen many english films and the ones i've seen didn't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work, colors and such. "game" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of "lola rennt" about this if you wish), but didn't succeed for me either. overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't anything special (at best, i'm afraid) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted.

at least among those movies with 100 votes or more. nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen? brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role?? nominated for best picture?? i always disagree with many of the oscar picks, but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy. the writing and acting were both horrible. blethyn's perfomance in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen, and probably the most over-rated acting performance of all time. awful movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it, including hbo(where i saw it). i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over-rated movies of all time.

time is precious. this film isn't. i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time.the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the film the critics are raving about? what a piece of crap!the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. get it?the acting is superb.the production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. the characters are shallow and unintelligent. i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next.i have had more fun doing the laundry.

painful to watch, and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. two of the main characters, cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter, spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. it wasn't worth the wait. i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view.

(spoilers)wow, this is a bad one. i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was stewart moss, a.k.a the unlikable 'hero' of it lives by night! he played the first crewmember infected, who dies from terminal depression. all i could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. this movie is full of truly unlikable people. there is no redeeming character in the film, not one. it's very hard to feel bad about dr. beck's turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into), because you just don't like him. and you don't like his shrill, bony wife, or the nasty sleazy sgt. ward, or dr. mustache love...so why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother caring about it. not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent bat special effects, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. not the worst film i've ever seen on mst3k, but down there in the bottom ranks, definitely.

the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour.remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in "five the hard way". he's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor. probably the most laughs you will have is with dr. beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. could mrs. beck be anymore wooden? seriously, if you took a 4 foot branch, stuck it in a hot tub, you wouldn't be able to notice a difference. the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll.watch it as a late night movie, mstified, but don't go out of your way.

"the bat people" is a really bad film that deserved the mst3k treatment just as well like that other film "the creeping terror."in it, we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats. we see many things happen, like bats flying out and attacking and stuff, station wagon chases, mishaps at the emergency room, and much more! all this, plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think "mitchell" here!), making "the bat people" actually one of the very best of the last "mystery science theater 3000" episodes made in the series! moviewise, it's awful. it should be avoided like the plague, unless tom servo and crow are watching with you."the bat people" - more like "the bad people!!!!!" lol1/10 of course!!!!!

i didn't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do. it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although admittedly it's no better quality than that. it's true that the acting isn't great - i thought marianne mcandrew as cathy beck, for example, came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot didn't really make sense to me. the becks are on a trip described by john (stewart moss) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now that's romantic!) the work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange (how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone's work?) but it gets stranger when we find out that he's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine (huh? that connection completely lost me.) bitten by a bat while he's in the cave, he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid (although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. here's another problem. the first killing is a nurse in a hospital. at first, everyone thinks her death was an accident. the second murder is of a young girl, who is described as having her throat ripped out. the sheriff (michael pataki) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse's (meaning throat ripped out? - how could anyone think that was an accident?) and what's with the sheriff? he seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in cathy's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. it's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved, and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i've ever heard in a movie. even for all that, there was something here that kept me watching. sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half. pretty bad, yeah - but not as awful as some people say.

currently, this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why i rented it from netflix. however, i am saddened to report that the film, while bad, is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list. i have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one. hardly a glowing endorsement, but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list.the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon (by the way, they are married in real life as well). he's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave. once there, they behave very, very, very stupidly (hallmark of a bad film) and are soon bitten by a bat. according to this film, bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us--both of which are not true at all.oddly, after being bitten, the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital!! the first thing on anyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately, but not this boob. soon, he's having seizures--yet he still isn't interested in seeking help! again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!! after a while, he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. but, by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood. when it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine, the wife (who, like her husband, has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe he's dangerous--even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road!! now most of the time moss is going through these episodes, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. oddly, however, a couple times he develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like. had this been really cheesy, the film would have merited a 1.in the very end, in a twist that hardly made any sense at all, the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. how all this was arranged was a mystery as was moss' and mcandrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974.overall, very dumb. the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real. not a good film at all, but not among the worst films of all time either.note: for some reason, imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it's alive and it's two sequels of the web page for the bat people. while the bat people has been seen with the title "it's alive", the two movies are not at all related. it's easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie i just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell.

ok, don't let my summary fool you. this movie sucks hard. but the worst movie ever? this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe. but it is in no way worse than manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, horrors of spider island, or a small handful of movies. as a review the movie sucks, it's terrible. don't see it with out mst or you may develop health problems. but there are worse movies.

i dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. "bat people" (which i saw under the title "it lives by night") is just such a movie. you can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on "night gallery", and not one of the better ones, either. the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were-bat who drinks human blood. (actually, you'd think if he was turning into a real bat, he'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood's the word.) in spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, dr. mustache aspen-extreme, insists that he's just having an 'allergic reaction' to the rabies shots. meanwhile, the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). also meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction. it's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (okay, it is pretty bad, but it's bad in a clichéd, wooden, professional way). it's just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved.i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, but:1)the director needed to beat michael pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until pataki agreed to act, and not just channel dennis weaver. 2)he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole "bat bites human, who then turns into a bat" scenario. 3) he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes', instead of resorting to "man has a seizure" page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms. 4) he needed to rework the whole 'wife' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. i would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of mike and the bots. it's bad, but it isn't bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. still better than "battlefield earth" or "waterworld", though.

i tend to like character-driven films. i also think hope davis turns in consistently good work, so i had high hopes for this movie. those hopes were soon dashed.the main flaw with this movie is the direction. there are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. the movie makes frequent use of the denis leary character as the alter ego of the campbell scott character. it doesn't work for me at all. this would have worked better as a play than a movie.there are problems with the plot as well. it is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. i didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.finally, the editing wasn't well done, either. there was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.except for acting, which i felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.

basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. the premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.the problem is the plot. the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. the rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (denis leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to "do something about it." i won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. the motivations of the characters are missing: why is she cheating on him? he's a dentist, decent looking, good father. the film doesn't say. who's she doing it with? don't expect any answers on that either. why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? who knows. what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? where is this film going? good performances by campbell scott and hope davis (and denis leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be american beauty or a family film. a root canal is more interesting. avoid it.

ugh! where to begin ... first, campbell scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish, curiosity and anger. only we don't care! these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable, and therein lies the key. they haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. when scott quietly tells his wife, "i could kill you" before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug, wisecracking apparition of denis leary before being hauled off the the looney bin. an utter waste of time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources.

this movie was not very entertaining, certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story. the characters (except the youngest) try to emulate the preceding actors, and they fail. the hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie. this really sucked, might have been good with the original cast, then again maybe not because the story is so weak. skip it.

a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie. so naturally, i was elated when this movie came out in 1994. i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself. i came away revolted and digusted. the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess. a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top.and it is not very funny at all. charles grodin is good but the buck stops there. bottom line:1 star. don't even bother.

i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick. "well lets see now, we spend 50% getting dirk benidict, cause battle star galactic and the a-team were cool. the we spend 40% making a demon costume, never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script. and we spend the rest making the movie." this was pretty bad and very cliche.... have a loved one present when watching (or bring a good book)

this is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative. it lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.the animation is well done but i feel like it is too presentational. i would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.but for a hollywood style film it works ok but it is very derivative of aardman films and this is bothering to me. perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over.i think the voice over is too glib.

'sherrybaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. the only reason the film is to be watched is maggie gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. this is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. even maggie gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that i should not care more about the kid.

this piece of crap, since i can't call it a movie, can be summed up by the following.-stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble -black midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitalia -black midget is mistaken(somehow) by man and woman who happen to want a baby -black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence, demean white people wherever he sees them, and commit more crimes -happy endinghonestly, it could have been a good satire if it hadn't been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it.

when watching little man , you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! your supposed to be laughing at it !! but will you ? probably not. the main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept (even as a cartoonish comedy ), so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is."but its a comedy " some of you might be screaming. thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.i mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face , wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious? and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag? and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously...what ? "its not about the plot , its about the laughs" you might be screaming . well heres the thing see, there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more. if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot, stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs.what ever you do steer clear of little man.

since this picture is classified a "pure entertainment" work and since there are already many comments on it, i'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film. certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. however far away from what i expected, i saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. and with a ridiculous happy ending. so what is the point? many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no.1 cullinan! but the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. and they call it humour. a diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.

so, has it really come to this? are we, as consenting adults, to blame for the next generation of cinema-goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability? concerning the wayans and co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; little man. this united kingdom p.g. (parental guidance), anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult, certificated movie, is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were "wiped out" from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's.the predominantly under twelve's audience here who, some without grown up supervision too, sat there, obediently, taking it all in, oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that little man portrays, in part at least too. movies, in general, can do better than this poor attempt, while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh, the biggest fear for the future of cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss. cinema deserves more than this, and so do its ever growing, and in the literal sense too, audiences, this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever-impressionable minds of the young.there is no cinema experience here, no open eyed wonder, no awe-inspiring respect to the magic of movies'. there is nothing but bewilderment and contempt, for the lack of substance, originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the hollywood machine, for the sake of a quick buck, we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.will this have the likes of hitchcock, fassbinder, leone, kubrick and schaffner reeling in their graves? money they all liked, no doubt, but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality, and to a vast degree, respect for their profession and audience, they were never short off. we are seeing, once again, with the works of the wayans clan another cliché of bad taste, while the likes of white chicks (2004) were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of american society. the irony here is that the two leading protagonists, played yet again, by the wayans brothers, are so much undercover, that all recognition is non-existent, this makes for a better movie too, and it is the actor terry crews that gives white chicks its substance and personality, not the wayans.yet again, with their pastiche of 1970's blaxploitation movies, as with the 1988 movie i'm gonna git you sucka, this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie, with heavy weights as isaac hayes, jim brown, bernie casey and the gorgeous actress ja'net du bois. the point being, that little man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever, he is shallow and narcissistic, with no appreciation or value toward his followers, he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it, has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism. there is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent, after scary movie (2000), things could only have gone up, but alas they did not, no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls' next movies shall be straight to video, one can only hope.the wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves, to a certain extent; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody, they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style. they have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that cinema have given us, may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement, as their growing audiences, so far, seem to be, for when the bubble bursts, may they be as understanding too.

i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. the so-called "jokes" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. i never want to have to see this **** film again, i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face

i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse (supposibly children's) film i have ever seen in my life.i took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins. the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film. they should pay you to watch it not you pay them. it's truly truly awful, there is no other way to describe it. the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences.aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards, stephen

i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk. to my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc... and for the most part of the film not very funny.the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag. so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.up until now, i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.a bit of good advice - wait till it comes on tv or cable

what's the point of reviewing a movie like this? it's painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it.movies like "little man" depress me. they represent film at its most disposable. this movie was made for a bunch of 18-24 year old dipsh*t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was, so that the film could quickly recoup its investment.a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit.grade: f

america. a land of freedom, of hope and of dreams. this is the nation that, since its independence, has striven to bring democracy, prosperity, and peace to the entire world, for the good of all mankind. there are times, however, when one cannot help but wish that the american's would just stay on their side of the atlantic. this 'movie' (and i use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. this vision of hell follows the adventures of calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of marlon wayan onto the body of a two foot-high dwarf. after inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of vanessa, a career-woman who is reluctant to have children, calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her. so, as any normal man would, calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year-old and parks himself upon the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by darryl, the broody husband of vanessa. darryl incongruously falls for calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife-scar, and the sex-drive of a 16-year-old. even more absurdly, vanessa doesn't see past calvin's baby-wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. this wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humour in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and paedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of 'family-entertainment' the wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality. the brothers dim attempt a freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he "had a bad father". repeatedly hitting darryl in the crotch enables calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and darryl have always wished for. as if this wasn't ridiculous enough, calvin's attempts to sexually assault vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little-woman, who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband. in this movie the wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of hollywood's recent body of work. additionally, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming african-american humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over-indulges in fart-jokes and crude sexual gags. by rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again. unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of american cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals.

"little man", now on dvd, is a wayans brothers flop. it's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by marlon wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. he and his partner tracy morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. he then goes through all sorts of "home alone" or "child's play" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. i was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. the jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. i almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use cgi and used the small actor who marlon's face was pasted over. in watching the deleted scenes (minus cgi) this actor was funny in a mini-me like way, but they chose a different route. a few cameos and tracy morgan make some funny scenes..spend your rental fee $ on borat if you want some real laughs these days.http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com

this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!this film is even worse than white chicks! little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby. story is awful considering it was written by six people. the idea still wouldn't be too bad though, if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid. the acting was very, very bad. so was the directing. anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is racist and very offensive to midgets. i mean, instead of showing sympathy to them, the film-makers make fun of them! it really disgusts me how they do it. they see midgets being just like babies. and for a character who is a midget, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. that is its lame excuse for showing something like that. it just was not worth it. don't watch this film. it is a huge waste of time and money.

this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life! the plot is ridiculous and the whole "little man" crap is just so stupid. the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb. let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters. the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. please, i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap. i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of! who writes this crap? the actors have no talent what so ever, how do these people get into hollywood? they are making money off this junk!

like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously, i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went', "yea!!! this is it. this is the next film we are going to green light!!" and whoever that person is, should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script, well, i'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money. this film is atrocious in every way.the wayans are funny, at least they can be. they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way. but in here, not only does the premise defy all logic, not only is the acting terrible, not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this film. maybe if it was free...naaah, it would still be a waste of time.usually i'd be inclined to write some long winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking. this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack.0/10..makes my top ten list of worst films of all time!

it's here. finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy: health inspector. yet i'm willing to bet the the wayan's brothers(hilarious) will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time, outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of romeo and juliet. i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to. the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials. final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me. and the commercials looked so promising...

there are some extremely talented black directors spike lee,carl franklin,billy dukes,denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry . then there are the wayans brothers who at one time(15,years ago) had an extremely funny television show'in living colour' that launched the career of jim carrey amongst others . now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags(toilet humour) as the standard operating procedure . people are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'little man' they couldn't possibly be . a baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old ? baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off . it is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands,darryl's, back .oh, yea that is just hilarious . as a master criminal 'little man' is the stupidest on planet earth . he stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her . co-star chazz palminteri,why chazz, offers the best line: "i'm surrounded by morons." based, without credit, on a chuck jones cartoon, baby buggy bunny . this is far too stupid to be even remotely funny . a clue as to how bad this film is damon wayans appeared on jay leno the other night,prior to the bat awards and he did not,even mention this dreadful movie . when will hollywood stop green lighting trash from the wayans brothers . when they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood .

there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled "baby buggy bunny" that was exactly this plot. baby-faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bug's rabbit hole. he dressed up as a baby to get into bugg's hole to retrieve the money. the scene in "little man" where he's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon. this was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon; not so much an entire movie. if you are really interested in this, buy the bugs bunny dvd. it's was much more original the first time (1954). plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot!

...ever. this is the bottom. i am not joking. the theater should've had a warning of some kind. 'abandon all hope ye who enter here' would've been fitting.i don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is. its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse. this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr. fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes.i remember when the wayans's were funny. i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate. i'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon.i disliked nearly everything about this movie. i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body. what i did like was the ending. not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.i gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less. i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star. this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it.when are people going to learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out. seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. avoid it at all costs. you have been warned.

when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct.i am a big fan of the wayans brothers. i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks. little man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.obviously, the joke will revolve around marlon wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. he and his partner, tracy morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington. in order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour. all these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok. i mean, it was not 100% believable but it was ok...nothing great. i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.wait for it on cable or television. it really is not worth any amount of money.

i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back. thsi film isn't just poor its dire. it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made.i regret watching this film.flixmedia reckons its a race issue, apparently "white" people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors. mate, i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel.please stop making crap films

rodney dangerfield is a great. he has done a lot of great works. but this one....is awful. the whole plot is whack. it could have been much better. the jokes in the movie aren't funny....their stupid. this was very not so hilarious. he can do much better than this.

having watched 10 minutes of this movie i was bewildered, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - i simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really awful. in fact it is so awful, that i had to watch all of it just to be convinced(!). during this, i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. the pattern is as follows: take one extremely popular comedian, make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that, and you have a success! i wouldn't know if this movie was a success, but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us.

unbelievably awful film. i watched part of this on t.v. recently. my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel. not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield's body, slap him around and scream, "how could you?" i know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. but please, hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. it's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe. the bottom of the cesspool, even by sunday afternoon television standards.

if you want to see women's breasts, get a porno. there is no plot, but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan. the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny, and, yes, boobs are boobs.

i was unsure whether or not andy sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "malibu express." with his film fit to kill he has proved that sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. the plot written by sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. the main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as ksxy. cleverly, ksxy is actually their secret headquarters. in "fit to kill" they confront their long-time nemesis kane, who is trying to steal one of russia's most prized diamonds. a well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. it is now suffering the same fate as clockwork orange and taxi driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. i am disappointed no critic circles have recognized andy sidaris's trademark filmmaking. the costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. it may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. my personal rating is 10/10. the drama is as thick as the blockbuster runaway bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece last action hero. andy, keep up the good work.

i really hope that concorde/new horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror, or even action movie when they made carnosaur 3. the movie is flat-out silly from start to finish. even the humor in c3 is funny because it's bad. definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad it's good' genre. if you enjoy the very worst of the worst, this is for you.

this is probably one of the worst "wanna be a low budget hit films" to credit the dinosaur genre. the film is so predictable you could go away, cook yourself dinner, go answer the phone or whatever and when you're back you'll know exactly what has happened. the special effects are so poor you would have thought lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator. the acting is over cooked. they try so hard, yet there just isn't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist... yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses. stereotypical was created for films like this. if you want to watch this film, i suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were. and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, don't watch it, you might break the screen - the facts are that far off.

this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch! i should have expected it, after seeing the first two, but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of "maybe they did it right this time". nope - not even close.where do i begin? how about with the special effects... to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "raptor" as it runs down a hallway. even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around. bad bad bad bad.how about the acting? if that's what you can call it. there is one character who, i suppose, is supposed to be from the south. however, after living in the south for six years now, i have never heard this way of talking. perhaps he has some sort of weird disability - the inability to talk normally. i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one.how about the plot? it's pretty basic - raptors escape, people with guns must hunt them down. i'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels... wouldn't they stay outside to hunt prey? oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them.other things - let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it. would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - army or marine? and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it? how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors - split up into groups of two. didn't they ever watch any horror movies (or at least an episode of scooby doo)? in short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie.

primal species (1996, dir. jonathan winfrey) international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs. the army commando team now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles.you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film. that is pretty much it. the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters. the story is poor, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. this film came out three years after 'jurassic park'. instead, this film looks to have come out 13 years before 'jurassic park'. the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes. there are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this. a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature. the is one good thing, which comes out of this film. the short running time. at only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether."it's like a friday the 13th nightmare." - officer (brian currie)

in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap. no script, no dialogues, no acting. and the brave colonel rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid proctor from the police academy. so this was a complete waste of time (fortunately not waste of money as i saw the film on tv). and i really cannot understand 7 people who graded this sh*t 10. they must've joked. my advice, if you see this title run from it!

this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen... it is humorous how bad it is.. the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing..(i've seen porno's with a better plot) when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away. but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it .. i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean. i couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower

if this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema, if you've never seen a "moving picture" before, you'll think this movie is a child of the gods. but if you've seen a movie, a tv show, even barney the dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed by this film. heck barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this flick.now i like b movies. i just watched "the giant gila monster" right before i watched this swill, and i liked that movie much better. it works as a b movie. it has lamer dialog,hokier acting, cheesier effects and an honest to gosh real gila monster as the monster! carno 3 just doesn't pack much of a b movie punch. it has some gore, and that polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is underwhelming, almost....flaccid. it's the little engine that couldn't of dinosaur movies. i'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained. if you're one of those people, then give this movie a shot.

this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. i rented it as a joke, expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes, and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life. the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life. this is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean to at all) of the action genre. i didn't see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, i don't think there's to much i missed. if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy, than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of advancement in cinema get thrown in the trash and get shat on by carnosours

like all carnosaur movies, this is a joke. the way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they cannot be any stiffer or more fake-looking than they were.the plot had no sense whatsoever. i mean, first they're on a bus, then in a warehouse then, all of a sudden, they're on a boat. and let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van, or on a ship? i thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. it sounds stupid even when you think about it.the only reason for which i gave this a 3, is because it's still entertaining. i found it better than the first one (haven't watched the second yet). just, don't rent it. i saw it on tv and it's a good thing i did because i wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it.

arg. the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film. this time, european terrorists(irish i'd say) hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium. they pull into a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, the cops and some marines. the whole film seems to be (again) largely inspired from alien(as carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? guns at the ready. this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot, with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off. the dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual and the t-rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars(it also appears to have no eyes). one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck. on opening it, surprise! the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them. why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first? how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside? what was the point of filming this scene???? oh bother, who cares? both thumbs down for the over-sized rubber iguanas.

i haven't seen the first two - only this one which is called primal species in england. i don't think i'll be bothering to look them out though.this is an awful film. terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. everything about it is so nasty. the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called polchak, who is an incredible jerk. no-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - i was having nightmares he was going to survive. the colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting. and the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno. i was waiting for her to take her glasses off, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she didn't. pity that, as it would've livened the film up no end.didn't roger corman used to make half decent films once?

ok..... this is the third in the series of carnosaur. lets star with the dinosaur puppets! in the start of the film you cant see the dino's cause when the body count starts you can only see the dino's eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with scott valentine as the leader rance, the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body's after the dino rampage, after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty creepy!!! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! it pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can see that its just a guy with a hand puppet!? wtf! the story is simple. 1. some terrorist's attacks some truck cause they though it wash some weapons in there. 2. they where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-rex in there! how did the t-rex fit in there??? 3. rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive=( 4. holy jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. the dino's is now on a boat in the pacific. 6: strange i didn't know that the t-rex had a strange thing on hes neck??? 7. the end. the film is good if you want a good laugh. 5/10

ok i had higher hopes for this carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out. i did like carnosaur 2 better than 1. i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right? well... i quickly learned i was wrong. i was extremely confused with the casting. they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer. now for rick dean lol, in carnosaur 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and wasn't really annoyed by him, now in carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier. now we are getting goofy here. the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks, but as soon as scott valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs.i'll start with the raptors first, they had there tails drag the ground, which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50-60 mph. now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads didn't move at all. there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place.the t-rex was extremely pathetic, they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies. at least that one looked somewhat frightening. the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time. the legs when it walked was hilarious, like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff. lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move, they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded (god the sound effects were awful) retarded!!! now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact. as for the rest of the movie, well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team i have ever seen. the weapons they used wouldn't make sense for the scenario. they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming, now i was tickled at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the dinos would get in there and cause some damage. instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time. i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies. you have retarded military, retarded dinosaurs, retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this.now i'm not saying i wouldn't watch this, bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment. it may seem like i'm ranting but really i'm hyping this movie up to what it is. its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself, "did the director really make this seriously?"

this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched.this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause. that is why he went insane? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever? and that's not the only thing. i'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie. nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him. it's a friggin minute long. who the hell wants to see that? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it. so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history. and i'm serious about that.it's not even so good its bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr. it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second. you want to know how bad this movie is? i'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again.

going into a movie like i this, i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills.....what i got was even less.christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe.....cept for the fact he's obsessed with santa. after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, he drives his van off a cliff.....into the moon. not the best ending i've seen but it was original.it was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers. there was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were toned down.too boring......4 out of 10

why, oh, why won't they learn? when you've got a nice, juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only gonna wind up looking foolish.christmas evil is the story of harry stadling, who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing (daddy-dressed-as-)santa claus back when he was a kid. so, of course, harry grows up obsessed with christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dresses as santa, and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children, and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (after all, how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) unfortunately, this film wants to be more "santa, portrait of a serial killer" than "silent night, deadly night". two-thirds of the film are spent documenting harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we've got some guy named lewis jackson. apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. the action jumps giddily from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.even once the film gets rolling, we're still treated to heaping helpings of harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. more depressing than frightening, christmas evil is one to avoid.

i liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board. the general idea in the first movie was, if not great, then at least very interesting. this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie, and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel, the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous. if you haven't seen any of these movies, then get the first movie and forget about the sequels, they can take away all of the joy from the original.

i'll make this short and sweet....this movie sucked!!!!!!i watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever, gave it 9 out of 10 stars. so i thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels, i was wrong. this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot continue and thats it. it was like bad outtakes from part one or something.i love walken, but i felt sorry for him here. i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film, but don't blink you'll miss him. there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don't like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals. however, it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth.this movie will make you like the first one a little less, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part 3 and i pray it is better than this crap.the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film. fast forward or skip to that if you can't stomach the first part.1 out of 10 stars - this was awful!

it's not often i feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film; after all i often feel the maxim, "if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all," would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like. if it's all the same to you the reader though i feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of christopher walken in a returning role as gabriel this movie is pathetically horrid. i say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original "prophecy" that you will be sorely dissapointed. if you buy it, return it. if you rent it, make sure it's only ninety-nine cents.what's wrong with this movie? a full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears, but a short summary would be the following: the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds. gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of god he once was (and in this role he is wickedly funny in the first) to little more than a thug for heaven. since walken is so good at playing heavies (we all remember frank white from "king of new york") he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents. if you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than i. one gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to walken's next big line. by the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of jericho fall on the people who made this un-natural disaster.bottom line - it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place. the original told the right story, answered the questions that should have been, and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards. there are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first - the priest who lost his faith, the little girl who kept the "big secret", the teacher who protected her children - even lucifer himself was more interesting by himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together. i feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy.

the prophecy ii, what's there to say about it? they've completely abandoned the originality of the first film, and simply made a chris walken splatter film. it's not even written by the original writer!if you've seen nr. 1 don't watch nr. 2 it's a real disappointment...if you haven't seen nr. 1 don't watch nr. 2! go see nr. 1 to experience something original and fun

i personally liked "the prophecy" of 1995 a lot. christopher walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely. this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to walken. walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel danyael (russel wong) and the human woman valerie (jennifer beals). this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... as i said above, christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel. besides gabriel, however, "the prophecy ii" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. the character of valerie was annoying enough, and danayel annoyed me even more. the biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of izzy (played by brittany murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. still, walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. the entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "prophecy" films. "the prophecy ii" is nevertheless the weakest of the three "prophecy" films with walken. definitely a christopher walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.

everybody knows that gregory widen's original "the prophecy" didn't really require a sequel, but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable. part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery. the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental. if it wasn't for walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig), "the prophecy ii" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release. the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth. the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales (jennifer beals) from getting born. for you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly "monkey" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel's evil dominion. thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown. "the prophecy ii" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity. whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you. his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences. on a slightly off-topic note, i often felt like "the prophecy ii" ambitions to look similar to "terminator ii"  gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where "terminator ii" ended as well. coincidence, i guess? overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of christopher walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?).

this is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie. i highly recommend the prophecy, but this movie was a dud from the start. the acting was decent all the way around, but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional. a 4 out of 10 at best.

i rented this on dvd yesterday and did not realize it was a "character study" type of movie, so i struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the stop button.even with a character study theme, i just could not get into this film at all. perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else, or maybe i had other expectations, but setting that aside, i tried my best to move on to finish watching, but gave up. the actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. about the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue. i think this movie should have been entitled, "who stole the sergeant's gun?" scenes were well done but putting them together i once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.since i didn't finish watching it i'd say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe. to me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time. i'll leave it up to you to try it, but it's not one i'd strongly recommend.

this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley. it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was. while it was an answer, it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2.the problem really became reality got lost on this show. for example- in one episode, johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick. amazingly, by the end of the show, johnny had healed entirely. along with that, the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley.this is a show that i would not want dvds of, & frankly hope they are never released. think since cbs was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's.

this movie is lame and not funny at all. the plot doesn't even make sense. some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. i'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. who are these people and what are they doing? basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. i didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. i don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, i can't think of any part of the movie that was good.

this film has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. the entire movie is about a girl getting sucked through a gate to another dimension then years later it gets opened again by a witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex girlfriend who is one of the other campers along with her new partner... another girl... that's right they're lesbians and there is some nudity of course for no particular reason). unfortunately demon follows the now adult girl back through. also unfortunately, none of this is ever explained. where exactly were they? where did the demon come from? how did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator type outfit? the acting is terrible i think but it's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. i give it a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty fun even though they were very cheap. i would not recommend it, it wasn't quite bad enough to be funny.

this is one of those horror flicks where twenty-somethings fool around with the dark arts around a camp fire, getting into a heap of trouble for doing so. a portal was opened containing a world of demons known as the kelippoth of the sitra achra by a man whose daughter, summer, gets kidnapped by something, taken into it. summer is trained by a mysterious group whose identities are never revealed to battle the demon monsters. this is a portion of the plot which lends itself to scrutiny. anyway, three wannabee witches, who went to high school together, renea, the most enthusiastic, serious practitioner in the dark arts, and her lesbian cohorts, jasmine and marlene(..it's more or less a passing fad with them, though..) join up with buddies, jason and ricky, on a trip in the wilderness where summer vanished from her home ten years ago. opening the portal through a spoken text written in an ancient book, a demon is set free, as is summer, now a warrior babe whose training has led to a very fit and athletic body and skills that have been needed to ward off monsters in the other world.low budget contains a loopy, but ambitious story, restraining it into a confined setting. these young adults spend a lot of time running around in the woods hoping not to be fodder for a beast. as can be the case in these movies, the demon stands on the sidelines while the story develops as summer attempts to remember how everything came to pass, while befriending jason who wishes to help her restore the lost time. the action is shot mostly in the dark, making any violence hard to decipher. brigitte kingsley(and the rest of the female cast for that matter), is some mighty nice eye candy, dressed scantily clad as a female conan, a gorgeous body we have to pleasure to gaze upon from the moment she appears until the closing of the movie. some lesbianism(..some kissing and fondling)and nudity spice things up nicely, and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it's so preposterous that the silly tone is probably appropriate for the material.might be of interest for co-starring world wrestling entertainment's "captain courageous" christian(real name, jason reso)as one of the group, spoofing his alter ego, as a chicken, quivering at the sound of a snapping tree twig. landy cannon is likable as unlikely hero, jason, a lovestruck, naive young man whose ex-fiancé, jasmine(vanessa james)is now bi-sexual and in love with marlene(..jasmine's cruelty is in toying with jason's feelings by hiding her affair with marlene from his knowledge), while ricky and renea attempt to steer him away from this idea that he can rekindle a dead flame that gone out, never to ignite again. the kelippoth demon is mostly darkly lit, i guess to refrain from showing how ludicrous/laughable it looks if presented in full. the lesbian antics of jasmine and marlene(haley shannon) is mostly tame, their love making, once alone in the woods up against a tree, is toned down and also lighted using the blackness of night. my rating is a bit favorable towards it, almost solely because of kingsley, for purely superficial reasons, rather than the plot or film-making. the movie aims to please and is marketed to the boys(and girls who love hot women). i think, though, for the most part, the humor falls a bit flat.

dark rising is your typical bad, obviously quickly produced horror/sci-fi/fantasy movie. it has a strange, unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them. most of the time i didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter, it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason. the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing. there is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made (like so many other bad movies). give this one a pass unless there is nothing else on t.v.

when i first tuned in on this morning news, i thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." it was slightly amusing for a week or so... but we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have way too much "playing around" time.at first, i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air. but seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. she is very unprofessional. she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore.jillian is not a good journalist. hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. she's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all i can say about her.also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the us, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. they're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. on the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...i believe "good day la" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news.side note: (i'd really rather watch ktla. however, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. they're still a bit dull though. oh well, i'll stick to nbc's "today." abc's "good morning america" is also okay... as long as diane sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)

i had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that i was soon near tears over the $3.99 i had wasted at blockbuster. joanna pacula's acting and her awfully rendered slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth. i knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many. both breuer and nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents. while we're on the topic of talent, breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe. she clearly has not learned her craft. in fact, she's really quite awful. all the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best. turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on. don't rent this terrible movie. you will be sorry you spent your money.

my comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which i find pretty offending, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people. please be tolerant of other people's opinion. obviously writing in the spirit of nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely.i think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions. one thing philosophers do agree on is that nietzsche was a great thinker. so making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, don't do at all. wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know. one might think this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. if someone tells a story about a tomato, i can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato. there is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts. specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.screenplay: one of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents. why? it distracts from what it should be about; nietzsche and the truths he found. it doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time! come on, make it proper english or better yet; german! even mel gibson got that part right... letting his characters speak some gibberish aramaic in the passion.secondly, it is well over-acted.3d, assante is not an actor to depict nietzsche. bad casting.4th, facts are way off.and so on. its a waste of celluloid.

i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else. when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes. i read yalom's book about a year ago and loved it, in fact admire yalom's work in general. (i am a clinical psychologist.) i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off. i'm not sure if i can take much more. at a superficial level, the faux accents, as others have commented, are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst. the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious. the portrayal of lou salome is simply flippant, and the brilliant freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy. i see very little of the book's spirit conveyed thus far. i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students. instead, i will refer them to the book. imagine that.

the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytical techniques and vienna's history. take a well-know genius you have not read, describe him as demented, include crazy physicians to cure him, a couple of somewhat good looking women, have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache, have every character speak with the strongest accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one (freud), mention a few words used in the genius' works, overdo everything you can, particularly music, and you are done. audience, please stay away.

...thankfully he hasn't, yet! this is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits. conceit 1: that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left. conceit 2: that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister's only critics are sinister civil servants, mi5, big business and the americans (naturally). conceit 3: that this radical socialist pm can solve all union, economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation. conceit 4: that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing. conceit 5: that the soviet union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's. and finally, conceit 6: that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against britain.it's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti-thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises. when it was made, television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. ray mcinally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show.

i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system. i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting. on top of that, i'm a fan of max fleischer's work, and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon. with both of those, i thought it would hold my interest. i was wrong. just a few minutes in, and i had the fast forward button down. i ran through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it.afterwards, i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn't give it enough of a chance. i recorded it again and watched it through. there's 75 minutes of my life i'm not getting back.i can't believe there aren't more bad reviews. personally, i think it's because it's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum. how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time?the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts, profanity, and puke jokes. the characters are flat. the parody of "swinging the alphabet" is lame, essentially cobbling the tune, getting through a - e, hitting the obvious profanity a "f", and then having no idea where to go. the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time, let alone the following ones. across the board, the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to "out-south park" stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny. this might be amusing if you're high. otherwise, it's not.

...but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time. and that takes some doing, what with the likes of various lifetime efforts. don't get me wrong--i have nothing against cicely tyson. i've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles (look at sipsey in fried green tomatoes, for example). but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery. and chew it she does, with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas goose.give me the classics anytime: alastair sim, 1951. with the exception maybe of scrooged, all the others are just over-the-top efforts to grasp the past, present, or future spirit of christmas.

the premise of an african-american female scrooge in the modern, struggling city was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. here, ms. scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. there is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. part of the problem is that story's roots don't translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end. this is a message film that doesn't know when to quit. in the title role, the talented cicely tyson gives an overly uptight performance, and at times lines are difficult to understand. the charles dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, in spite of its very relevant message.

two old men sitting on a park bench . i don`t really have a problem with this scene - only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movieyup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this . they also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black . let me see now , a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . well i guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype ? why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930sstereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with i`m not rappaport is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows . walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie

much like orson welles thirty years earlier,mike sarne was given "the biggest train set in the world"to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.how anyone given the resources at mr sarne's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes "heaven's gate".both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio's largesse,whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey "joanna" in his locker. furthermore,"heaven's gate" could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where,tragically,"myra breckinridge"s cupboard was bare. simply put,it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood.

it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years. for me the main problem's the uneven script.while some of it is witty and hip, quite a bit of it is dull, unfunny and lifeless. many of the gags just sit there, lacking spark and energy.of the cast, mae west and rachel welch come over well. roger herren in the role of rusty shines (too bad he didn't make more films). but for my money, there's just too much of john huston, and poor rex reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance. his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines, wondering what he's doing in this film.the low user rating should give an idea as to the public's opinion of this piece. vidal's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted. not even the 'classic' film clips did much. all in all a rather sub par effort, and it's not likely to get much better with time.

i never much liked the myra movie, tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time. certainly miss welch's costume became an iconic image, though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about -i rewatched myra on fmc a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. there's a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic books, where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. however, imho, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too silly to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage, or entertain ---

this film was the worst film i have ever viewed. it was like a "homework assignment" for a film class. it totally misses the mark when it comes to the "message" it is trying to relay. characters are over exaggerated, poor acting and as for a plot...well it is utterly ridiculous. the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film, the co-actor is handsome and that's about it. moral of this movie: never judge a movie by it's cover! save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i. it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it!

ben & arthur could have been a 10. sam mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, "sam this is bad, really bad".jamie brett gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. a second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!

i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans, but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie.i don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else did,if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards.most fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up baby.here the director or writers try to rehash the idea,but it fails miserably.i've read comments about how "creepy" drake was,but i thought that was far too mild a description. franchot tone walked through this one as if he were hungover.a casting disaster is one thing.this film is a total disaster.this one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and i don't know why that's a requirement.too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults.unless you want to torture someone,give this one a wide berth.

stalker is right! girl sees guy, girl wants guy, girl contrives mundane ways to keep bumping into him, girl won't leave him alone, girl pretends to be a patient, girl can't stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl still won't leave him alone. played right, drake's character could have been charming but she's completely, wholly, unrelenting in her pursuit of cary grant's character, her girlfriend-in-cahoots is dull, and sadly, drake's attempt at playing, "charmingly screwball" comes off as, "disturbingly demented." grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for cary but it's as close to a phoned-in performance as i've ever seen from him. the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim.screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, like in this stubbed-out butt of an attempt, it just stinks. worse still, drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of valium and a restraining order. she ruins any humor to be found in this drier than mummy dust relic.

one-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge. department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage, pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant. the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry. i guess the word "perky" just about sum's up drake's approach to the role. she does have a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, i began to overdose. grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. there is one scene, however, that almost salvages this slender exercise. drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies. here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable, and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes, the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day-dream, circa 1948.

heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: it's desperate to teach us a civics lesson, and it won't stop until we've passed the final exam. fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer), have a spat with their senator (eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career), get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace. henry wallace!! a year later, he was considered a near communist dupe, but in 1944, he was a-ok. add in some truly awful musical moments, a whole lot of flagwaving hooey, and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and you've got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: d.c. boogaloo. drastically unfun, heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.

hey everyone...there really isn't much to say for this movie at all. the basic plot is that a guy (brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. after picking up a girl on the way there, things start going badly wrong for all of them.the storyline alone (written by the actor playing brandon, i believe, although i could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted out accordingly. the "clown killer" himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. far from being a dark, mysterious but most of all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. the only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things).in short, this film falls below every possible set standard. admittedly, i was sharing a few beers with a close friend as i watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that s.i.c.k did fall just shy of a two rating. however, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.1 star out of ten.

ok - i adore this film...i will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic. i could never watch this movie alone. i've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres , on its viewers. incredible masterpiece.... horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me .oh bless their hearts, whoever made this awesome film. i love it. i thought the whole film was decent and interesting. this movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life! not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was brendan's fabulous acting. best horror film ever. nothing can ever be this scary again. halloween viewing at its evilest.

the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome, you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea, but this movie's actors are worst then ben's performance in pearl harbor, porno's have better quality and better actors. i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first, the plot and script are also horrible, nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense. the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house.

worst movie on earth. i don't even know where to begin but i hope i can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie. when it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex. the actors are some of the worst i've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. the movie must have had a record breaking low budget which i'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover. this movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies. i would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare. i feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment i put us through. don't see this movie!

the threesome of bill boyd, robert armstrong, and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. with the outbreak of world war i, the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar. the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u-boat. these sequences are lively and well-filmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy-drama with a flat ending. for fans of the stars only.

it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made. a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best.the editing drags on, there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take, and the soundtrack is unimaginative. so much more could have been done with this video movie. i guess they ran out of time, or videotape.hand-held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them.

in this extremely low-budget ( i've seen home movies made with better production value) australian utter rip-off of "the burning" & "friday the 13th", a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat. they're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before. this movie is even proclaimed to be 'the worst australian film ever made' in it's dvd promotional material. that's it's only selling point! complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way. perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers, but it still made me want to burn out my retinas.eye candy: a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower scenemy grade: f

why was this film made? even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead. for goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film are aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like john michael 'hollywood' howson, the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday, and the voice-over guy in countdown. but in saying that, this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves : none. the script is bad (even for a self-confessed b-grade horror) and the acting and film quality is worse. it often looks as though it is a home movie, but even a home movie has 'realism'. anyone interested in australian cinema, please, for the love of god, pretend this film was never made.

this movie should not classify as cinema. although it is over 10 years old now, it should never, ever have gotten funding, and is a blight on the australian film industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as "the dish"the actors cannot act, the music is.. to be blunt, not music, the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.do not watch this film. it is a complete waste of your time.

this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy, accept for it being an australian film with people who can't act.once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon. now, a number of years later, the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video. it is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money, see it only out of curiosity, or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to (not be able to) act. lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours, but ended up in the x files - how did that happen?

i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen! i'm embarrassed to be from melbourne, where the film was made. diabolical acting, amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. as for the plot, well, thats even more stupid! some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was. there's a reason they put these types of films on late night tv - because they're utter rubbish! avoid at all costs.

houseboat horror is a great title for this film. it's absolutely spot-on, and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give 10 out of 10. there are houseboats, there is horror, there's even horror that takes place on houseboats. but if there were ever a tagline for the film poster, it would surely be 'something shonky this way comes...' for houseboat horror is easily the worst australian horror film i've ever seen, not to mention one of the worst horror films i've ever seen, and a fairly atrocious attempt at film-making in general. the good news is, it's so bloody awful, it sails straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity. it's worth watching *because* it's bloody awful.the category of 'worst' comes not from the storyline, for the simple reason that there actually is one: a record producer, a film crew and a rock band drive up to the mystifyingly-named lake infinity, a picturesque rural retreat somewhere in victoria (in reality lake eildon) to shoot a music video. someone isn't especially happy to see them there and, possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour, starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife. even more mystifying is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this, on the surface, it looks like a very bog-standard b-movie slasher. you've got highly-annoying youths, intolerant elders, creepy locals (one of whom, a petrol station attendant, would easily win a gurning competition), and let's face it, my description of the murderer could easily be jason voorhees. ah, but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the comparative masterpiece that was friday the 13th part vii. unfortunately, houseboat horror is completely devoid of both these things.but in the end, this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing. fans of one-time 'late show' and 'get this' member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems ('check out the view...you'll bar up!'), while the actual song to accompany the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed - i can't help wondering if writer/director ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit. the horror element is comparable i think to b-slashers of the genre and particularly of the period, but there were times when i couldn't help imagining someone biting into a hamburger off-screen and seeing a volley of tomato sauce sprayed at the wall on-screen.indeed, if you've been listening to tony martin recommending this film as hilarious rubbish like myself, i don't think you'll be disappointed. any fans of 'so-bad-it's-good' horror should not pass up the opportunity. whether you'll 'bar up' or not though is another matter. if, on the other hand, you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre, get yourself a copy of the incomparable 'long weekend' and don't look back.

"houseboat horror" is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'see the movie that can't get an academy award'.an underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback.badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.it certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.if you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.at least it's better than swedish "the bleeder".4 out of 10.

watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994-1997 spider-man cartoons made me realize why i couldn't stomach it when it first came out.i'm from the old school, where the 1967 spider-man cartoon was the best and still remains the best. (i won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains please.)the acting in the new stuff is lousy, read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting. paul soles, where are you now? this guy was the best at voice acting for spider-man. no one comes close. watching secret wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me wince. dr. doom sounds like a comedy version of bela lugosi. in a scene with red skull and doc ock, red skull has no german accent while ock is heavy russian! the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting. iron man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, captain america sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid. paul frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever. the old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. ever hear mel blanc's son? no way can he replicate his dad.the animation is clunky. okay, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds. sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic. i really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are. the stories are badly written, and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible. why, for example, when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other? in secret wars, it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement. i can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the punisher, but why the thing and iron man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous, then the torch joins in. this is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff. give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off, but "hey what are you doing here" and "you don't tell me what to do" are lame reasons. another badly written scene is in the wedding where harry osborne unmasks himself to spoil peter's wedding. that whole scenario was awful.last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls juvenile violence - meaning no punches at all. in secret wars, the lizard carefully ducked the thing's charge. but the thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics. he must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons. sure, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12. that's why they can't have punching, because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence. but you can blow things up, these cartoons will include that. as a kid before political correctness came in fashion i saw cartoons punching each other. what's wrong with a punch to the chops? is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch? i find this the most insulting of all when i watch the new stuff. they've written out "the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves.kids, enjoy these cartoons all you want, i've seen enough.3/10 rating

i liked this show! i think it was nothing with wrong with it! only that spidey don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck! some people only think this show is bad because of that. the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x-men, the punisher, daredevil and iron man! to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it! best spidey show ever!! my favorite episodes are: 1. turning point 2. spider wars 3. the hobgoblin 4. the alien costume 5. mutant agendabut there are some episodes that was really really bad like: rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch. and i don't like morbius and hydro man. first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don't like vampires. and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season 2. of course i have to mentioned hydro man! he was terrible! i rather see sandman! his last appearance was so terrible. and i don't like spidey as the man-spider!but i guess everything than this was bad!

as long as you can suffer it! if you like watching people waking up, getting up, getting dressed, having a shower, preparing dinner, watching each other, having sex in the dark, then going back to bed to sleep... if you like tacky flats, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence.... if you like getting bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "real intimate false art", then you will like it. but if you don't, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "as long as you are here", but do we want to stay? this german movie got the award of the torino gay film festival: italian journalists still don't understand why the jury took such a bad decision, as the festival presented lot of talented movies. maybe to be nice with a german, as they don't often get awards? well, "the lives of others" did... but this one is excellent but not gay. so maybe it is a question of fashion. germans are they "in" again? no matter what? or maybe only for a hustler's glance of some directors?

it's interesting that all who (so far) seemed to like this film had no expectations--i guess that's the trick. in contrast with them, i had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was, i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director--that's always a clear sign of them, they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. the actors in this film, though, had only one facial expression each. if the close camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the film killed it. the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur, as well. "ooh ooh, we're going to light the set with a flashlight! that will make it all seem intimate!" no, that made it all seem invisible.on top of the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated. (perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany, but in los angeles, forget about it.)the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards doesn't indicate the quality of the film, but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals. i can assure you that this film won't win anything in the festival where i saw it. in fact, two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer's "total darkness" technique). but when the film shuddered on, instead, there were moans coming from the audience. and once the movie finally did end, it was clear that it hadn't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points. an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). yeah, we get it, the life of the lonely old man was boring-- but we figured that one out at the very beginning.i recommend that audiences miss this one, it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers.

this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney mardi gras film festival. i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me.i actually like films that take time to develop, films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow. stillness is good. but this film though was just plain slow.credit must go to the two main actors. there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people, misfits really, come together in a very awkward way. there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them.i also liked the setting and the way it was shot. it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters.i just don't understand the ending. what was the point of it all?

i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film. the only reason why i didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda. the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing.the problem is with the rest of the picture. alice faye comes off quite hollow. don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material, he comes off so terribly corny.the plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye.it seems that by playing the song and dance man, ameche's marriage gets a second change to reignite. some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts.s.z. sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. ditto for j. carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role.this is a chica chica boom bomb of a film.

despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed, this film was a disappointment. yes, it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's all there is to this movie. there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. it's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute. one of the best world war ii films, "twelve o'clock high," has very little action. but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. the exception to "the story of g.i. joe" is a brief battle segment (titled "city under siege" on the dvd) which takes place in italy. admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie. but alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. another turn-off is pvt. dondaro, played by wally cassell, who is meant to be a "romeo" but comes off a pervert. by contrast, sgt. warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. as he says to capt. walker (mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: "every step forward is a step closer... to home." but that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink. too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches. as for meredith's portrayal of pyle... it is practically comatose.

heavily re-edited and often confusing, the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years haven't made it any better. this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer, with scott glenn's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family. an interesting cast - joe pesci, brooke adams, danny aiello, jonathan pryce - have all done better, the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott's exceptionally fine score (part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard) makes a positive impression. one case where the remake (made by tony scott, the original choice of director for this version) is an improvement.

steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. he certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. but even mcqueen can't save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st. louis.mcqueen's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. there's more than a broad hint that there's a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke. he's not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke, all pretty rough characters. that would certainly get my suspicions aroused.the great st. louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix. guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn't do much of anything. one of those two jokers decided steve's performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation. this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen. i'm willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can't believe they would have if they saw this.or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey.

when the remake of when a stranger calls was out, obviously i was interested in watching the original. then when i read about the original (which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day) i saw that the real money is on black christmas, which apparently beat everyone to the "the caller is in the house" punch. so i netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its "very long wait." all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it! then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives! ...and it's a total snore.sure, maybe i had elevated expectations, but i don't think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh. the thing is it's christmas in some canadian college town, and there's this sorority having a party. we see some killer-pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. so we know he's in the house. then we're introduced to our characters-olivia hussey as the mousy, whiny, canadian-accented jess. margot kidder as the annoying, overtly aggressive alcoholic barb. she's so annoying even her mother dis-invites her for her christmas festivities. there's also this irritating janis ian clone ("phil") and this alcoholic den mother mrs. mac, seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house. we also meet jess's highly-strung boyfriend peter, played by keir dullea of 2001 and bunny lake is missing fame, though halfway through the film i was still asking myself "which one's keir dullea?"so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls, but this was before email, so they couldn't ask him to send a photo. then-well, you know how they say those plastic dry-cleaning bags are not a toy? one of the sisters finds that out the hard way. don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic-encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic-there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film, obviously there to make you say "oh my god! there's a corpse in the attic!" though after the first hour that changes to: "how come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominently-placed plastic-encased corpse in the attic?" especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house. really, any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime; the cops are so dumb. fortunately some of them look like john saxon.anyway, after a lot more darn boring human drama, the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy-looking trap door that rests atop it (those wily cats!), for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble. now we have two corpses up in the attic-hey, why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic?so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously, and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside. they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back, they need to keep him on the phone. jessica, who has grown even more whiny, mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller "who is this? what do you want? who are you?" after like the first 89 calls, when it is clear that he is not going to answer her. isn't that like a sign a developmental disability? the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something? and what's he going to do, suddenly say "oh yeah, hi, it's bob from the laundromat?" dumb jess.spoilers! anyway, soon janis ian and lois lane (kidder) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces (this film's idea of gore), and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked. hello? are you being stalked or what? then the cops realize that the killer is in the house, and call jess and tell her "don't ask questions, just do as i say walk to the front door and get out." so what does moron jess do? starts screaming "phil? barb? phil? barb?" hey, great idea sister. now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? of course she does, and sees her former friends, all splashed with ketchup, prompting this viewer to scream at the screen: "have a clue now?!"now, obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place, and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to, and seeing a plastic-covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably was scary back in the day, and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths, so they wouldn't think to, you know, lock the doors or windows. and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. you see, people were stupid back in the 70s. we have to understand that. one of the big shocks is that we don't even see our proto-final girl kill the psycho. but believe me, that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for. spoilers end! ------ hey, check out cinema de merde, my website on bad and cheesy movies (with a few good movies thrown in). you can find the url in my email address above.

this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. it doesn't work at all. firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. it's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. but there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. you can also see that in the very unsteady character development.you almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one.

i'd never heard of this, then found out it's the man with the deadly lens, which i'd heard of but not seen. connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. it wants to be a sort of cross between dr strangelove and mash, but it just isn't that funny, unless you find the name general wombat (?) funny. it comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. there are many, many flat scenes in the whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work. it's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks, which i think are meant to be played for laughs, but again, aren't that funny. the location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap tv. i could not believe the man responsible for key largo, crossfire and elmer gantry did this. only laugh: connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. it makes never say never again look like genius.

follow-up to 1973's far better "cleopatra jones" has statuesque black actress tamara dobson returning to her signature role as chic, super-tough narcotics agent, here busting a heroin ring in hong kong. cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu b-movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags. the shoot-out finale is right off the assembly-line, and dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she puts a unique spin on her comically-stilted dialogue, but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her--she's jaded). stella stevens plays the villainess this time; she's good, but can't match shelley winters in the predecessor. ** from ****

if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. i can only attest to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. i first thought my dvd players was messed up. it wasn't. if you insist on watching it i recommend you adjust the color on your tv until it is black and white. if you don't you will never be able to get through the film. if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of pulp fiction.

this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them burt reynolds), a prostitute, and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami. the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time. the movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening. in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the developing process to save the images. somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera. amazing that this film was even released!

the bfg is one of roald dahl's most cherished books, but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there. this version remains pretty faithful to dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on john hambley's script. if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs. one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie..... instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch. children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic.young orphan sophie (voice of amanda root) lives in a none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers. one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street. the figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night. sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country, and fears that he will eat her. but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg (voice of david jason). the bfg refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foul-tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers. however, giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast - every night, as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans. sophie and the bfg become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants. together they go to the queen of england (voice of angela thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants. the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else.jason voices the bfg quite well (one of the few pluses in the film) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality. the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life. similarly, the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated - sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other). even the places are uninventive; giant country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons. at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences. little of dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily. one chapter in the book deals with the bfg's love of "whizzpopping" (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious. in the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling. i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what i got was pretty much the opposite! this one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip.

this was not enjoyable to watch. frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) job just so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with snide captions. the bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious. and sad. the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic, instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured.essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is. it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker.

best of the best 4, is better than 3, but just barely. basically, i say this because part 4 doesn't contradict parts 1/2 (like 3 does), (ie. their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings).anyway, i liked the russian plot line of the story, and especially sven ole-thorsen's bit part as boris. aside from that though and a few fighting scenes, the movie is nothing special. the limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the airplane blow-up scene).also, part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did, there are a couple of more better known actors (hudson, thorsen) in part 4, but alas nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles).alas, it seems best of the best is the rhee show, and to be truthful, he cannot carry a movie.saw on tape, rating:4

**spoilers** i rented "tesis" (or "thesis" in english) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort "the others". based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror. instead i wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film "anatomie" (which this one kinda reminded me of).the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela's (ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. angela, and her horror-buff friend chema (fele martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it.this leads to... well, nothing.they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls. there is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. the rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. in "tesis", *potential spoiler ahead* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says "ok, ya got me, it was him after all"! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after.the only thing that drags "tesis" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! i'm political!". the final scenes, in which the "point" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. if he doesn't, he certainly should. this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff.overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. the urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ("videodrome" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: "my little eye")... "tesis" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. on every level, this one is better left dead and buried. i'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.

when i saw the commercial for this, i was all about seeing it. now, forgive me, but it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went. suffice it to say, the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the "movie" they sold me on.i was bored, annoyed, and incredibly disappointed by this movie. and if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? i guess if you never saw the commercial (or trailer, i suppose) you may think this is some hot stuff. for my money, the commercial was way better.

a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all-night horror movie marathon. however, as the night goes on, there's somebody among them killing them off one by one. who is it...and why? i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991. i was looking forward to it--but boy! it did not work at all. the premise is a good one, they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like dee wallace stone on board...but it doesn't work. the story stops making sense halfway through (that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how this got an r rating is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid.it's really too bad--this movie had potential. with a better script this could have become a great horror film. as it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it (i heard stone won't talk about this one). i give it a 3 and that's just for the cast.

the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie. as usual tom villard is good, too. otherwise it's c**p. the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out "the possessor"? lame.

i suppose many people comment/review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- i'm writing due to the latter.i was excited for the sequel to "wargames" .. i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content, i felt it was worth watching more than once. this being 2008, i had high hopes for what they would do with this film. computers, gaming, terror, military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film, and "wargames: the dead code" had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.the movie failed on pretty much every level, but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects. "the dead code" was a 1990's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms. meanwhile, will farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen. until finally he "wins" by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (nobody is near the gas). because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, this tells ripley (the real life war machine) that he is a high level terror threat.even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity. they say things like "he has expert knowledge of bio-terror" ... he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio-terror. so then a movie-long chase scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues. they have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter.. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him.. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.ugh... i would write more.. but i already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.

i don't know what else to say about this horrible movie that hasn't already been said. honestly i have only myself to be angry with. i should have know better when i saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap, but i loved war games so i indulged my whim. i will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. from the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game i knew i was in for a ride though the land-that-good-writing-forgot. the list of very, very, very bad plot lines, dialog, and acting is so long i would crash imdb if i tried to post it. to those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me. i am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung.

let's face it-- if you rented a stdvd sequel of a forgotten 80's gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. wargames: the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily. movies like this don't need spoilers, because you already know them.the "plot" for this "film", is as follows: nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the "film"; nerd and girl are captured; the top secret government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer; nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first wargames "film"; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. the end.the acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- b-grade. some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of colm feore, then you should avoid this one. granted, the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking stdvd sequels, then you are right at home.sadly, mathew broderick was too involved with some "masterpiece", that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one. but can you blame him?

i didn't enjoy this film. i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. a 20year old computer saving the day? i thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film. i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it.its a shame, but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. this film could have been a 21st century version of the old film, it wasn't. if that is what you want to watch, do not watch this film! even if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very very cheesy flick..

will farmer (lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and ripley, the super government computer, designed to profile potential terrorists, tracks him because will borrowed (by hacking) some money from his next door neighbor's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in philadelphia. the next door neighbor whose computer will was fixing, has relatives in the mid-east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor's bank , and ripley sees a terrorist connection. ripley has the power to call up missile strikes. oh, oh!this version of war games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the war games movie in the early 1980s. well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days. makes sense. so the movie dazzles us with fantastic cgi on computer screens, and once joshua, the forerunner to ripley, is found operational, we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing, hoping, praying.sort of, oh-oh-ing, omg-ing, and more cringing hoping things will go their way. in other words we are now experiencing a made-for-tv type movie, and it's oh hum time. go back to the 1980s and watch the original war games movie. it's much better. but, we really have to ask ourselves: are we making computers too intelligent where one day, in time, they will rule us? hmmm..violence: yes. sex: no. nudity: no. language: no.

if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece. how could it be worse more you ask? well...at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra. other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. and for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once. maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again.

okay, i absolutely love ben stiller, although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston. i do not think this girl can act in the least. every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting. it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script. this movie only had one good thing about it, and that's that ben stiller was in it. this plot is so used and abused it's ridiculous. how many movies have this same type of plot?? can we say "forces of nature??" not only is the plot so old, but the outcome is so predictable, it's boring. i knew everything that was going to happen before it did. it was a bore, but watching stiller is always a delight!!!

this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related items.no wonder they were given away, surely no one could part with money for this drivel.how some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief, the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on.how on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable. mostly toilet humour and badly done at that.anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.

i saw this for free, thankfully, and wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years.ben stiller and jennifer anniston play a couple who are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other.if that plot line doesn't take you by surprise and thrill you, the movie won't either.lots of sight gags and fart jokes. halfway through the movie i began to realize that ben stiller really isn't that funny, but he tries very hard. and jennifer anniston really isn't that pretty, but her hair looks great. and hank azaria and phillip seymore hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho-hum movie, i've come to expect more from them.what was interesting was that i saw this after i saw american splendor, which is a truly funny and original movie- and i compared the two in my head, and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back- perhaps that would knock some sense into them andthey'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes.

i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year, but perhaps he should insist on quality, not quantity.i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in "along came polly." stiller's reuben is grating, charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. stiller's schtick is getting tiresome. he undoubtedly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually funny. because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.there's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston, which is a shame because she's a good, smart actress with a promising career. as long as she keeps making more movies such as "the good girl" (in which she's terrific) and less like "along came polly," she'll have a career of which she could be proud.aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she's working, but it's a daunting task for any actress. with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin, as reuben's boss stan, and philip seymour hoffman, as reuben's best friend sandy, there's nothing funny in this awful film. other supporting characters, including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude, are annoying. azaria's accent is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny.the premise of "along came polly" certainly showed promise. unfortunately, it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of this lame, dull, boring excuse for a comedy.

the movie appeals to public due to charisma of ben stiller and notoriety of j. aniston. it seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title, but there's nothing successful in this movie.polly is very well played by aniston, no doubt. this is the kind of character which suits her perfectly. bem stiller is the same troublesome guy like in " meet the parents", but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above.the script is very poor with nothing special at all. with this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better - but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script.4 out of 10.

i have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of "boom!", and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory. so i voted "1" and hope you will too. together, we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross, and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing "boom!" in its director's cut extended version. the movie is one of my howling favoritesyou just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself, "yep, i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time." producers considering the dvd release of "boom!" should note that, everywhere it's been shown, there have been sellout crowds in the theaters. but it hasn't been up to frostbite falls yet.

is rich, ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? actually, both are applicable in director joseph losey's wandering, meandering mess called "boom", appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. richard burton climbs taylor's mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber. though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even liz 'n dick-philes should shun (the stars' collective "what the hell!" attitude to their late-'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). pointless, confused, and maddening, "boom" is a catastrophe--although screenwriter tennessee williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play "the milk train doesn't stop here anymore", was said to be quite fond of it! * from ****

whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome. otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor (her downward phase), and richard burton (his miscasting phase). tennessee williams wrote "the milk train doesn't stop here anymore" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money.whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a "must see" kind of thing. but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. sadly, this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two oscars. for burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb. judge for yourself if you dare.

i rented this by mistake. i thought, after a cursory examination of the box, that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. instead, it's a "christian" story, and i suppose is fairly typical example. if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc., but i found it rather painful. i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance). and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent wsj).overall, thought, i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it's certainly wholesome...

the premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible. interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming. it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc). i like to think that god is a little greater than that.

i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian. i am not. if you are looking for a christian movie, i recommend this film. if you are looking for a good general movie, i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere.i was annoyed by the characters, and their illogical behaviour. the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong. one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this. i find that offensive: are we to believe that "thou shalt not steal" came from jesus? i suppose he wrote the ten commandments? and stealing was acceptable before that? i rented the movie from netflix. i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments. oh well.

i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. an interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. in addition, i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie. so, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. this was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. the film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the "time machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.

i picked up time changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and i was in the mood for something like that. the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn't expect a fundamentalist christian film!the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being. our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - jesus is nowhere to be found. this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg-wells-style time machine. the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point, which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film. earlier (or perhaps immediately later, can't remember for certain), our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says. what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about, however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful.in any case, that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time. so, if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors, then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as i don't think there's any evidence (and none was offered) for the physics of time travel in the bible. so immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there, but never mind...after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future, the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases. it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year (as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself, a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date: it's just two thousand and... *honk*). some of the shock went on a little too long, though. for instance, the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van. he sticks his head out the window like a dog might, is scared by the headlights and the starting engine, etc. that seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic. in any case, that's easy to ignore. the rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder. eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same. a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy (go figure) and investigate his name. they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is. the movie frames these guys as non-believer bad guys for being skeptical.just before the professor is to head back to his own time, he is confronted by those two men. in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away, he eventually breaks into an almost insane-like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him. just in time, he's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about.the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self-proclaimed (and most likely false) prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god-given knowledge (that was stated or even hinted at).as i understand it, revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying (and failing) to send a bible into the future. first 2080, then 2070, etc. as the scene fades out. clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he shouldn't be able to know! essentially, the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only, it means there couldn't ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know! the entire movie's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it's own credibility in the end.

falsely accused, skirt-chasing chums john wayne (as john scott) and eddy chandler (as kansas charlie) change identities to become "alias smith and jones". mr. wayne becomes "john jones". mr. chandler's is supposed to be "rev. smith", but wayne calls him "dr. smith". at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis, pete duel, jonathan harris, or ben murphy; although, wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career wise. pretty blonde mary kornman (as anne), grown-up from her days in "our gang", is a lovely interest for wayne. she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne. if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.

one of the more 'literate' lone stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialog and acting business. the opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, kansas charlie (eddy chandler), and his buddy, john scott (john wayne) the rodeo (say roh-day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. the film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). and oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here. no yakima canutt. cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. no george hayes. tedious stooge-like bi-play between scott and charlie, with charlie swinging at scott, scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). the skilled paul fix is underused. eddy chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. the villain looks too old and fat. so does chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. mary kornman, of the twenties "our gang" (see 'mary, queen of tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with john wayne, but that's about it for this one. seeds of a better western lie buried here.p.s. the ultra-short colorized version, which looks good, moves along so fast, it's over if you blink more than once. thankfully though, the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut.

before i explain the "alias" comment let me say that "the desert trail" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges. in fact it features carmen laroux as semi- bad girl juanita, when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short "saved by the belle". in "the desert trail" john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard. like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is moe hitting curly. wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy. playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after wayne robs the box office). no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl. things get complicated at this point because the villain (al ferguson) and his sidekick larry fine (played by paul fix-who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's "the rifleman") see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. moe and curly get blamed. so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones. who do they meet first but their old friend larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie). larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's "our gang" shorts). kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them. even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad. the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. there is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing. one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

john scott (john wayne) and partner kansas charlie (eddy chandler) are trail buddies who make their way to the rattlesnake gulch rodeo. scott is a pretty fair contestant, but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. quite coincidentally, bandits pete (al ferguson) and jim (paul fix) decide they'd like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter farnsworth (henry hall), and make it look like scott and kansas charlie are the killers. wayne and chandler use a running gag in the film where they're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities. each time chandler takes a wild swing, wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.if you're very attentive, there's a neat lipton's tea ad in one of the scenes in which scott's love interest anne (mary kornman) appears.later on in the film, the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery. having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, bad guy jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but pete shoots him down. while being patched up, jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister anne. in an unbelievable scene, anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff."the desert trail" is one of the blander john wayne westerns from lone star productions during this era. noticeably absent are george "gabby" hayes and yakima canutt, one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters. if you're a john wayne fan though, you'll have to see it once, but that will probably be enough.

this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time. for one, it has his old friend paul fix in it; fix, being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain, brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters. the plot, about mistaken identity, payroll robbery and murder, is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western, but wayne's strapping good looks, easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable. plump, balding eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's womanizing "partner", and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome. on the other hand, wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman, the little "mary" of the early "little rascals" fame. she is a grown-up 20-year-old now, blonde and cute as a button. most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star/monogram "b's" were fairly bland and colorless, but mary is perky, cute and, yes, sexy. there's a scene in the general store, where she works, in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic", which happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf. wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps, then again as she comes down, then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935. wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt. anyway, it's an interesting little "b", not great, but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time. the final gunfight isn't handled all that well, and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while, but all in all, it's worth a look, if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman.

this movie is horrendous. decent fight scenes or not, the acting is really bad, like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card. with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between different character's lines, combined with hurried line delivery by others). if the movie were all action, this might be forgivable, but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and family guy style, irreverent cut aways (oh, wow, are they badly done). i'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these, but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip. now to the fight scenes. they're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (nothing like drunken master). the fights have an overly staged feel, with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved. in sum, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very, very cheap production. which guy you may ask? oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and stared in this middle school masterpiece.

the beginning of this movie was good. it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie. they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy. how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day. a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it. how can so many people have little respect for other people? i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie. there were some good parts to this movie also. some people might like it, but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

quirky, independent, theatrical, christian slater--these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so "discovering" a jewel of a film. boy, was i disappointed. julian po never gets over itself. the film is relentlessly self-conscious. i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment. the overdone, obviously theatrical sets, the overdone, obviously theatrical acting, the overdone, obviously theatrical directing -- well, you get the idea. allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. and it's hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him. the ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying townsfolk, the idiotic clergyman, the bratty kids -- why would anyone, particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside (slater's character), decide to stay in such a dismal place?
