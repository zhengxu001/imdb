the plot for descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. one near the beginning - one at the end. together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. everything (and i mean _everything_) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. i like disturbing movies, i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming. rosario dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. and no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the nc-17 version, which i saw.if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch "descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.

"it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable." and for good reason: they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman. and let's not kid ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of allen's bergman pretensions, allen's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding. what i don't get is this: why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman, but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for "ripping off" hitchcock in his suspense/horror films? in robin wood's view, it's a strange form of cultural snobbery. i would have to agree with that.

the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "swedish" film - the first being susan sontag's "brother carl" (which was made in sweden, with swedish actors, no less!) the results? oscar wilde said it best, in reference to dickens' "the old curiosity shop": "one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell." pretty much the same thing here. "interiors" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. ("i'm afraid of my anger." looking into the middle distance: "i don't like who i'm becoming.") the directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from bergman are close to parody. the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. ("i read a poem of yours the other day. it was in - i don't know - the new yorker." "oh. that was an old poem. i reworked it.") far from not caring about these people, however, i found them quite hilarious. much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like kenneth branagh in "celebrity").the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergman's "winter light," the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. it all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.allen's later "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. i'll take "interiors." woody's rarely made a funnier movie.

i don't know who to blame, the timid writers or the clueless director. it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (angie, charlie, denise, rosanna and jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. this could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of timidity, even cowardice, that hung over each scene. since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not angie harmon? why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world? if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead? this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. what a waste, not just for the viewers but for the actors as well.

this film is mediocre at best. angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. her bitchy demeanor from "law and order" carries over in a failed attempt at comedy. charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy. the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and denise's marriage. hopefully that effort produces better results.

the film is bad. there is no other way to say it. the story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. i don't think most people know what a "walker" is or will really care. i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's. the subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in dc. i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. most didn't stay for the q&a either.i don't think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. i really didn't get woody's (carter) private life or boyfriend either. what were all the "artistic" male bondage and torture pictures (from iraq prisons) about? what was he thinking? i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody's character (car). it didn't work. it didn't even seem to make sense really.the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson. he played his character (car) flawlessly. you really did get a great sense of what a "walker" may have been like (say twenty years ago). he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. as for lauren, lily and kristin... boring.don't see it! it is painful! unless you are a true harrelson fan.

this film is one giant pant load. paul schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. and his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. the worst though is woody harrelson, whom i ordinarily like when he's properly cast. he plays "the walker", a homosexual man in d.c. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the washington elite. he couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. his "southern accent" is that "off the rack" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. it is monotonous. but, his is not the worst accent in the movie. his "boyfriend", played by moritz bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a mid east accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. he is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is german, and speaks several languages - one of them being italian! that's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? from the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end. the only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: lily tomlin, lauren bacall, and kristin scott thomas. only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. in fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. if you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. this movie is not worth your time.

i rented this on dvd and i kind of feel bad since dawson and lugacy are so earnest about it in the dvd comments. it's not a bad movie exactly, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre. plus, it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways, and the characters' behavior often strains belief. i'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you don't have a lot of film/tv/literature/life behind you (to be honest, i've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even). otherwise, its point has been made before and more artfully. and that gets to the big problem, which is that it really doesn't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point. it ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and it doesn't really pay off.

plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller related topics. characters are interesting though sometimes. not realistic but interesting nevertheless.development is slow like tea drinking ceremony. visuals not stunning, but good enough to ease the eye strain. good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing overexciting. movie sitcom style.i liked woody - excellent performance. had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good. the rest are bearable though very predictable. the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows.

this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.i thought "the walker" would be thrilling and engaging, but i was so wrong. the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much. seriously, the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. that's how slow it is.the fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom. it's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? it's sad that "the walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing.

this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , i just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining the producers of this movie were very clever. they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, woody harrison ,kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning

a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out.with such an outstanding case, one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins. but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity, no character arcs, and inexplicable behavior.the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand, completely unexplored. it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers. when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture?a regrettably dreadful movie. when will lauren bacall pick a good one? i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas. this one is definitely one to miss.

i saw this movie at a drive-in in 1959. until "howard the duck" i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen. this movie tried to combine all the genera in one; comedy, horror, teenage angst, and the hot rod that must have sired "my mother, the car." maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it's time.

ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical 1950's teens in turmoil movie. it is not a horror or science fiction movie. plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their "hot rod" club because they cannot meet the rent. once kicked out, they decide to try an old haunted house. the only saving grace for the film is that the "ghost" (paul blaisdell in the she creature suit) turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell.

"ghost of dragstrip hollow" was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural. in this case, the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted. with nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house. as you may have guessed, once they arrive, some weird things start happening. and there's a twist at the end.there's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's nice entertainment nonetheless. my favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot. well, let me rephrase that: he didn't talk like a character in a quentin tarantino movie, but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird. the movie's pure hokum, but harmless.

"ghost of dragstrip hollow" appears to take place in a spotless netherworld, an era long gone by, where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket. it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival, who pressures her into a car race. that's about it for the drag-racing--this b-flick is mostly concerned with rock 'n roll, man! the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent, square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone. there are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges (necking kid: "we thought we'd come out for some fresh air"...dad: "where did you think you'd find it, down her throat?"), but the ghost is a little late in arriving. brief at 65 minutes, the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off-screen and a pre-"scooby doo"-styled unmasking which makes no sense. however, for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** from ****

the characters are unlikeable and the script is awful. it's a waste of the talents of deneuve and auteuil.

kareena kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm.akshay kumar...anil kapoor....maybe saif....kareena kapoor in a bikini.....good banner..kareena kapoor in a bikini.....not one good reason not to see this movie....or so i thought ........didnt these people make jbj...why o why did i forget that.for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn't that bad...there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch.kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way.akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be.anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny, you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him.saif is sidey ala main khiladi.. once again.there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles, and a few goosebumps during the kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm).but mostly this half promises more than it delivers.....which makes the second half all the more unbearable....there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come.instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words.saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick...suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic, you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to big for her body ( only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation).anil kapoor and his sidekicks get on your nerves.akshay kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while.all the while you are subjected to one absurdity after the other.why??!! what??!!! when?!!! where?!!! what have i done to deserve this...a collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half, which were ordinary even without the movie around it.cannot relieve the trauma anymore....conclusion.this movie starts of as a buzz which you feel could even turn out to a high but ends up slowly moving towards a headache and then rapidly turns into a full blown migraine attack.please don't watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest.+s cast, akshay kumar, first half.+/-s what, when, how, who to much confusion.(need a book to fill this).+s cast, the whole second half (need many pages to fill this).total 3/10 (im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is).

i don't want to go too far into detail, because i can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film, but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie. the animation is crud and the story alternates between boring/pointless to extremely irritating. the humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - ghost in the shell fans, this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor just did not work after being translated. it was a total chore to watch this movie, and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest, especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything - i wasn't expecting a ghost in the shell sequel, but i was expecting something entertaining, and it simply didn't achieve this. yaaawwnnn... rent kino's journey instead.

ok, i am not japanese. i do know a little about japanese culture, and a little less about japanese pop culture. other than that, i am spanish, i eat paella and i like black humor.good, with that point set, i can comment on the movie: i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences, mamoru oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised he came up with this. it may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases, i am afraid it is, but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible. the jokes seemed bad, the script was overcooked- i mean, give the audience a break, and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action.however, i thought the animation was really cool. the idea is great, and it is well exploited in those animated scenes. however, the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures. it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene.i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this. the idea was good but horribly exploited. maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes. but hell, if you thought talking head was dense, amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke.of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european. probably this is totally useless to japanese people, maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation. maybe.

jewish newspaper reporter justin timberlake (as joshua "josh" pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers "thank you" to testifying officer ll cool j (as rafe deed) as he leaves the witness stand. in the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. you will see mr. cool j's devilish detective partner dylan mcdermott (as frances "laz" lazerov) decide not to murder damien dante wayans (as isaiah charles). the cops in the city of "edison" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope. whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (herein, called "pussy") or win a pulitzer, the city's corruption does not sit well with the noble mr. timberlake.timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger. writer/director david j. burke keeps the film above water, but just barely. ll cool j beats timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" sweepstakes (aka the "rapper to actor" progression). mr. mcdermott has fun with his role. lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors morgan freeman (as moses ashford) and kevin spacey (as levon wallace). f.r.a.t. means first response assault and tactical, but it's more important to know that "edison (force)" stars justin timberlake and ll cool j, not morgan freeman and kevin spacey (who seems lost).**** edison (9/17/05) david j. burke ~ justin timberlake, ll cool j, morgan freeman, dylan mcdermott

i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap. the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie. no, it was a hundred times worse. ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever.the american cop has a german accent! the "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "police station" hanging on the wall. there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet.this cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. he tells his cop partner to wait in the car. then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag. the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because - he's a moron! the dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen. it is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, doesn't know what is happening! the director of this film is a total hack. i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldn't take it anymore. it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i won't waste anymore time on it writing this review. absolutely worthless.

zombie nation 2004 rhey, i was bored. i looked in my comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. zombie nation? hey, i love zombie movies. says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. i could've used that advice.zombie nation is just like troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. it has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. this film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. yup, he's a serial killer cop. not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. this guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. he doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. talk about boring! eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. they were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. the women then act very poorly and take their revenge. oh yay.this film was crap in every category. crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. the women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. they can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. the gore is weak compared to even many pg-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. you see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... then the exact same breasts later! go figure. guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. the police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in. you can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set-up and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing. steer clear, it's a waste of time.1/10

yeah, i'm sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times. man, i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear.net instead of renting it. i'm a big fan of the george romero movies and i'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie, he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard. i mean, what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie's devils? it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer, especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop/police station/apartment/flat/whatever room it was with the gong in the background, and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop. i couldn't even tell what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations didn't help either. oh well, what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world. so, for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad c movies (c for craptastic), then this is the movie for you . . . or not.

last weekend i bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of "land of the dead".boy, was i wrong. it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art, which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre.we watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone. they actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, i couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore.some people actually consider this a "so bad, it's good" movie, they are liars. i didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through.this is even worse than "zombiez" do not watch!

german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium. this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew. i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto, morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. the answer is: subterranean; lommel dug a pit and buried it.the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. only someone who has lived in los angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.the main character, a villainous beat cop, is played by a german actor with a thick german accent. aside from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest beat cop in la. despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody, then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse), and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners, the lapd refuses to investigate, going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.the sets are excruciatingly bad. the production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "precinct 707" on a cardboard wall.since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of european emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands), bimbos, mimbos, and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets, special efx, locations or other production value, it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. sadly, they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental.more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. the other fits right in, with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie, as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. don't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered, just accept lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.after much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. they look exactly as they did before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. looking nothing like zombies, they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll, and injects large doses of cheesy euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. we're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.unlike other zombies, lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er, i mean, as they did before becoming zombified. this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. yes, a golden shower it is.i won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. all i can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. the spirit of ed wood lives on... or should i say his geist.

btk killer, green river killer, zodiac killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.i've never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful. like the movies i said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together! after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is. he is the worst out there.the credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in. the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots. the editing is easily the worst. this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and i was only 45 minutes in the movie. i couldn't take it anymore. i wasted 45 minutes of my life.do not watch this crap!

this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life. i'm not even kidding. it was poorly made and the actors couldn't act. it was a waste of my time and money. it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own. the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise. nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case. it appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie. the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie. which watching the credits was the best part of the movie. this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn't believe how badly it was put together. scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like "whats going on?" the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene.if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is. i wish i would have watched it before i rented it.

acclaimed director mervyn leroy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas. high drama is found in the loves and infidelities in new york's social set. oh yes, don't forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder. the all star cast features: barbara stanwyck, van heflin, james mason, ava gardner, cyd charisse and nancy davis.

the animation in this re-imagining of peter & the wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the film is sleep inducing. they should have called it "peter & the snails", because everything moves at a snail's pace. i couldn't even watch the film in one sitting - i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture.save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me.i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the best animated short (short!) category, the voters will have to sit through the whole thing. i already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning.

this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale. a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence. however, after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence. however, out of no where, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life! what an odd, silly and preachy film! personally, i'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable!the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.

bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry (as fred and emily hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. they use the money go traveling. their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann (for mr. kendall) and lonely percy marmont (for ms. barry). but, they remain as boring as they were before. arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from shakespeare's "the tempest") "rich and strange" by ordering up some camera trickery. an opening homage to king vidor's "the crowd" is the highlight. the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared cat.*** rich and strange (12/10/31) alfred hitchcock ~ henry kendall, joan barry, percy marmont, elsie randolph

yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation. as with juno and the paycock, you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie. there is almost no style or craft to it at all. the story revolves around fred and emily, a young married couple, who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage. emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. this might seem more believable if fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. the couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. the third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat. joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. that's about all you can say for this one.

i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together, the talk is not of the master's great films like "north by northwest" or "strangers on a train", but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931, obscure and seriously flawed, which showcases the great director in fledgling form.emily and fred hill (joan barry and harry kendall) are a middle-class london couple scrimping to stay ahead. he begrudges their lot; she accepts it. change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury. they make plans for a world cruise. but their problems have only begun.just ask richard hannay, roger o. thornhill, or marion crane. well, marion's indisposed at the moment, but you get the idea. travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, setting one up for a perilous journey at best. this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable. hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case domestic drama rather than suspense, but the two do not cohere, at least not here.the hills are a dull, flat couple, with no chemistry or personality. when they find themselves at the folies bergère, in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film, they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers. "the curtain's gone up too soon!" gasps emily. "they aren't dressed."when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing, even if the people they partner off with are drips, too. emily's man, gordon (percy marmont) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which he suggests be filled by emily. fred's girl "the princess" (betty amann) has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five o'clock shadow. there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger, a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue. subtlety was still to come.everything is shot in an abrupt manner, with confusing blocking and strained dialogue. hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off, and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears. when fred and emily break off, they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged-together rickshaws, one of many clunky attempts at symbolism.emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character, in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon, but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes, her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion.matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with, and presumably repair their relationship. only they aren't active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates.at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s, and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food. "rich and strange" is hitchcock paying his dues, and learning his trade, one for scholars but not casual film goers.

there is no suspense in this serial! when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day. no, in fact, the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode! this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made, let alone released on dvd! obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films, but even the script is awful. an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that, i am not quite sure, because it is too awful to follow. watch the 60s version, or the 90's versions, or even batman begins, just anything over this version!

...this would have been what you got.words alone cannot describe how bad this is. if you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes.robert lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he's phoning it in here. in an interview, johnny "duncan" robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight! duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape.driving a batmobile that looks like it rolled off honest al's used car lot at below sticker price-- the dynamic duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's bruce wayne's car they're driving-- in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial.the acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i'm sure it read along the lines of "batman says something here" because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along.batman's utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again. his cowl is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike.in one scene (i am not making this up), batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods. it's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it's so highly flammable isn't explained. well, unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it's a cardboard warehouse because batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground. thanks batman!in another scene after the batmobile is disabled, batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one! yes, you guessed it, said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds. not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to gotham city.there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone vicki vale who is convinced bruce wayne is batman-- she must have noticed the batmobile parked outside of bruce's house-- or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood.everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen. if you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark-- if you want entertainment, try the burton batman films, the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial.

granting the budget and time constraints of serial production, batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any "cliffhanger" list, utterly lacking the style, imagination, and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor, batman.the producer, sam katzman, was known as "king of the quickies" and, like his director, spencer bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement. (unfortunately, this team also produced the two superman serials, starring kirk alyn, with their tacky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporting players.) the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles ("robin rescues batman," "batman vs wizard"), mechanical music droning on, and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around, either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks. batman's cowl, with its devil's horns and eagle's beak, fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes. his "utility belt" is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!in any case, the lead players are miscast. robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman. he creates the impression that he'd rather be somewhere, anywhere else! john duncan, as robin, has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue. he is too old for the part, with an even older stuntman filling in for him. out of costume, lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink, without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial.although serials were not known for character development, the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast. this one offers a group going through the motions, not that the filmmakers provide much support. not one of the hoodlums stands out, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, "the wizard." (great name!) actually, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a sack over his head, with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing. the "prime suspects" -- an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.even the established comic book "regulars" are superfluous. it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne. despite the perils she faces, vicki displays virtually no emotion. commissioner gordon is none-too-bright. unlike in the previous serial, alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is "mr wayne's residence." they are props for a drawn-out, gimmick-laden, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design. the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel. the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing. (the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)pity that the filmmakers couldn't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure. while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious "batfan," one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined.now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!

couldn't go to sleep the other night. so i got up, flipped on the tube & this movie was on.film makers bit off more than they could chew. just as ambitious in scope as "forrest gump" was. but gump read like an fairy-tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era. tgmb just relies on tired clichés to tell the story. almost like a broadway musical where actors have to ham it up. every character's purpose was to fill a silly 60's archetype.take how we're introduced to finnegan: hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of mlk. criminey, talk about heavy-handed. why not just give him a t-shirt saying "i heart black people"?sunshine: "isn't free love groovay, man? oh no, i didn't have my period." mary beth: "i want to go to berkeley, not square ucla." uh, excuse me? there was nothing square about la in the 60s. rather than take the time to demonstrate what made berkeley unique, we just hear this brat whine about not going there.can't even remember the black kid's name. he was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are.thing is, period pieces don't have to be this cheesy. take "dazed & confused." look how we're introduced to the football hero, randall floyd. we don't first see him on the football field. in fact, we never see him play football. we're introduced to him in class, inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.in "dazed" feminism isn't a casual by-product of some chick getting knocked up. it's much more organic, more serious than that. it's refined in the ladies' room over a flip discussion about gilligan's island. serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. but real life is like that.some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. i agree! which is why i feel so disappointed by this piece of baby-boomer pornostalgia.

major league: back to the minors (1998) ½* starring: scott bakula, eric bruskotter, corbin bernsen, dennis haysbert, jensen daggett, written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg-13 (for language and some violence) by blake french: 	believe it or not, in the new john warren comedy "major league: back to the minors" there is one funny scene. it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face. it's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, it's all this film has to offer...enough said. this movie is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also just plain bad. even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got. it is so familiar it just isn't funny. how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made? last years we saw this same material in "air bud: golden receiver," and as bad as that film was, this is even worse. at least "air bud" was family oriented. "major league back to the minors" is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon. it is too childish for adults. so who is this film for? teenagers? elderly? people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?	the film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make: teamwork conquers all. yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes. where the silly announcers form their own "buddy comedy routine" muttering one liners to themselves like "they suck," "this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass," "this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost--maybe it was his mind," "somebody needs a nap," and "ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play." where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name. and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny.	"major league back to the minors" is so bad; it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. the good baseball team is on a comeback, they are about to win and--the power goes out. i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion, but in reality, its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time. the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny. there is another kind-of-funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer. the coach's answer: "you're too old, too slow, and too fat." the player's reaction is to die for. but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time, and certainly is not worth a cent of your money. so here is another dreadful entrée into this genre of film, another that is doomed with its own script, which is failed before seen, and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again.

this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen, the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film. i am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame!

how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel? all it does is throw balls! worst of all, it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series! the comedy suffers from not being funny. where did all the unintentional laughter go? enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long. bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout. what's next, major league 4: return to the little league? ehh, could be! leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all-star game. this one's had three strikes too many.

this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise. i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland. (yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good, and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league, but still be consistent.) anyway i loved the first major league, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the indians would finally go all the way to the series. you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. what happened? anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk.

this 30 minute documentary buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. first, let's admit that 70 years later, spain is much richer than it was then (and when i say this, i fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). and if poverty receded in spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that buñuel favored, but with western european style capitalism. but one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of pi. teaching math to poor people, the horror!. buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. what is he proposing? that children are taught exactly what at school? doesn't buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?

the writer/director of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film. i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. the story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional. for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director). no poker fan in this world likes this movie. even your money man hates this project. to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker. keep your day job. and if it's playing poker, then you must be hurt'n.

people, please don't bother to watch this movie! this movie is bad! it's totally waste of time. i don't see any point here. it's a stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. i rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.

**spoilers contained**i'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. what i didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. what starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about honus (soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss) and cresta (candice bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne. the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. they then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base. as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. so far so ordinary. then comes the ending. after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. in some ways, soldier blue reminds me of frank perry's last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. i didn't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, i would recommend elem klimov's come and see.

soldier blue is a movie with pretensions: pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man, on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam. well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things. what soldier blue actually is is pernicious, trite, badly made, dishonest rubbish.another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies. what it is basically is a lame, clichéd, poorly acted "odd couple" romance - strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick.there is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little native american children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up, and large-breasted native american women are molested, raped and strung up - no excuse, that is, except box office. (the massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming. now that's what i call exploitation.)forget all the pap you've heard (including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie) about this being a "protest", an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples. this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax. instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss (lousy actors both, in this at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the us (and britain, and all so-called "civilised" nations) have participated in over the centuries (iraq?). this just isn't that movie.

first of all, this film can be divided into three segments. a promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the cheyenne. this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast candice bergen and "soldier blue" traveling together to reach the safety of an army garrison. miss bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s jack nicholson movie. i mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability. the third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an indian village. this is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived. not recommended. - merk................................ jacobe (comment above) here's an idea. why don't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal nonsense. this is not a political site, it is for reviewing films. - merk

now, i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...i appreciate the fact it's a spoof, but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing, acting and dialogue. seriously, this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen - it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that...okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume its a heart attack), the army then launch shells, rockets, bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of power rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did i mention the rubber suit monster???? (10) that god-awful music, non-stop!

yes, the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner matt monro. it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature, stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond. add in harry andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of stock footage of wildlife, and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard, and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of senegal.

the head of a common new york family, jane gail (as mary barton), works with her younger sister ethel grandin (as loma barton) at "smyrner's candy store". after ms. grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves, ms. gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore (as larry burke) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman."traffic in souls" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it isn't remarkably well done, and it doesn't show anything very unique in having a young woman's "virtue" threatened by sex traders. perhaps, it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length (claimed to have been ten reels, originally). the new york city location scenes are the main attraction, after all these years. the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move. **** traffic in souls (11/24/13) george loane tucker ~ jane gail, matt moore, ethel grandin

kirstie alley, looking a bit slimmer, but only a bit, is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike, bleached blond hair and all. the premise of the movie is about an older woman (50!!!) who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting, inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. the actor who portrays kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast, it was torture to watch their scenes. what is there to say about this film. avoid it.

1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10(dir-jon keeyes): over-the-top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like friday the 13th(versions 1 thru whatever). i can't think of much redeeming here except(or can i think of anything?)the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this, supposedly. but, lo and behold, one of the stupid people, have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered(again, how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this). guess what? the murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is(so there goes any mystery whatsoever). and besides all this, where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them. i can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made. you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher, at least in their movie-going experience, but not so by this filmmaker.

this piece ain't really worth a comment.. it's simply the worst "horror" movie i have ever seen. the actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry. shame on you i say!!

without a doubt this is one of the worst films i've ever wasted money on! the plot is, erm sorry, did i say there was a plot? the scariest moment was when..., nope can't think of one! the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was..., nope can't think of one for that either. you knew who the killer was right from the start. there was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, misty, in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off. this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie!!!

this movie is outrageous. by outrageous, i mean awful. i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the acting got progressively worse as the "movie" advanced, and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem. that was not intelligent. truthfully, stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed. if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie, bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.

"american nightmare" is officially tied, in my opinion, with "it's pat!" for the worst movie of all time.seven friends (oddly resembling the k-mart version of the cast of "friends") gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare, a pirate radio show. it's hosted by a guy with a beard. that's the most exciting aspect of his show.chandler, monica, joey, and... oh wait, i mean, wayne, jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj. unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening...crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. these fears include such stunners as "voodoo" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.no. really.this movie was, in a word, rotten. crazy nurse's killing spree lacks motivation, there's nothing to make the viewer "jump," the ending blows, and--again--voodoo?if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent "american nightmare" with them.if you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local blockbuster, rent all of the copies of "american nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.

this movie had to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen. the acting was terrible, horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone. what a waste of time! first, as soon as the movie began i realized what i got myself into. all they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. the prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho, and one knife! its absolutely ridiculous. i was not scared at all during the movie, which i thought horror movies were supposed to do. as for the making of the movie, its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. i mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of "scary movie" for example. at least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie.

when i read the back of the dvd case, i thought that it sounded really interesting... so... i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the "4 for 20 dollars" section at blockbuster. when we got home and popped in the movie... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to each other going "this sucks. let's put in something else." i'll admit, a few of the lines from the friends at the café made us smile a little bit. but come on, at least get some decent actors! every once in a while in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over(or under)doing their lines. but i can only take so much. crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines... amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film.anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie. it's the most pointless thing i've ever had the displeasure of watching. do not watch or buy this movie!!!!!

when it comes to horror movies, i am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore sub-par production values, and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare. this movies simply has no good scares to offer. it can't even be enjoyed as camp. bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the kills were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was wretched, even the costumes were bad. i felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with terrible, contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. i doubt they got any rehearsal, either. it's embarrassing to watch, and so boring than making it through to the contrived "surprise" ending requires tremendous endurance. it's quite easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen.i don't normally write reviews, but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others. this movie is a complete waste of time. if you must watch this movie, don't miss the "making of"-featurette. the writer/director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold, daring move. (seen it.) he and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it's a new-age "citizen kane." it's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their christmas pageant. they truly think they've created something of substance. it's sad, really the only reason i gave this movie a "2" is because i think "1" should be reserved for true atrocities, like "manos: hands of fate" and "space mutiny." so "american nightmare" isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.

in texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party. meanwhile, they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. a serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. "american nightmare" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were friday, 13th. then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating halloween. from this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of c production. however, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. with a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie. my vote is four.title (brazil): "agonia" ("agony")

the premise is amazing and the some of the acting, notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp, is charming... but this film is near unwatchable. the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap. most of the singing is off-key. i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it... the dialogue is really stupid and trite. the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots. i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering 'when is it ever going to end.'

so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film, and you might be thinking to yourself, "huh. there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30." funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person, or at best a small, coordinated group of "open house" groupies. the truth, my friends, is that this film is truly unwatchable. just because it's "independent" doesn't mean it gets a free pass. if you're going to make a musical, whether on film or on stage, whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a.) your actors can sing, (b.) your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. even anthony rapp can't save this one. it's one of those unfortunate movie-going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.

i feel totally ripped off. someone needs to refund the $4.95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening. what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place???...somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made. i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact. the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view...shot on dv??? nuff said. the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section. want to see a good musical? then don't rent this movie.

the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise, and seemed like it could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they weren't obvious rhymes, they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical, right? not in this case. luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of the dialog was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.

this movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. we love musicals, but not this one. even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). the character marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! we think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).

did heidijean really see this movie? a great christmas movie? not even close. dull, bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart. i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie! the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance. baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing. probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with. maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played 15 days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie.

carly pope plays jj, a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant, overbearing mother moves in with her. jj, aghast at this turn of events, then blackmails restaurant owner, alex, to entertain her mother in exchange for "maybe" reviewing his dying restaurant. alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother. there are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. jj is a self-serving, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. jj's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. the underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own, without male assistance is bad, bad, bad. the acting is uniformly dull, the script uninspired. the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city. i would so not recommend this film.

i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but neither was i expecting it to be so awful. i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel. i turned it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed, or almost done out of a job, or driven to madness inside her own home? are you kidding me? i was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house. i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all.i didn't buy any of it. i tried giving it several chances, i really did. sorry.

i hate to sound like an 'old person', but frankly i haven't seen too many movies that i like that were made after 1960... generally, movies just seem to get worse and worse (although i quite enjoyed the scott baio vehicle "the bread, my sweet", except for the 'de rigeur' sex scene which added nothing of value to that movie). this movie makes the mother, a former las vegas chorus girl, seem to be incapable of surviving on her own, although she is clearly in her 50s (though hinted at being in her 40s). i didn't buy it. i'm 57 and like all the women i know in their 50s and 40s, more than capable of surviving on my own (as i have been doing since i graduated from high school at 13, got legally emancipated and set off on my own life's journey.) the daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve (a great opportunity) and drops that ball too, but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver, the writers shoot her down as an 'opportunist', when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker, a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises (to her boss, in this case).the daughter grudgingly 'allows' her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, but then treats her mother (the woman who gave her life and raised her to 'adulthood') like a pariah. apparently the 'writers' of tripe like this do not understand that it is not 'the common thing' for parents to act like children, and then be treated as children by their children. that is just more of the societal 'baloney' that hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we, their public, were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.this is a sad movie with a stupid ending. if the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional 'tv character', he'd have stayed with the mother, who was not that much older than him and quite attractive. but in the end he 'falls' for the daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way. (the 'opportunist' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive, physically.)there was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter (who was an uptight, selfish, self-centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted, sweet-tempered, humorous, and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend. of course the mother had her own flaws... she had reacted to her husband's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually like baloney. (where's the mustard?)

having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie. i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities, but this is not it. this plays like a bottom-to-mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g. ss experiment camp etc (perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually). granted it has a greater scope and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non-actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots, spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock' sequence. the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power. watch channel 4's 'the holocaust' (aired recently (still running?), as of 1 no 2006) for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war (featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage). this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation garbage (a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie). rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a treatment of the subject).

although, i had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie, this sure as hell wasn't what i would have had in mind, had anything actually come to mind. once i heard of its existence, all i knew was that i had to own a movie called please don't eat the babies. unfortunately, i could only find a copy under its alternate title, island fury. looking back, i guess i could call it a lose-lose situation. on one hand, i still don't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called please don't eat the babies, and on the other hand, island fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful, pointless, boring, unwatchable piece of garbage. yeah, definitely lose-lose.i'm not even sure what genre they're going for here. just early 80's badness, with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non-flashback. first up, two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys, once caught, the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string, around her neck, and somehow, these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere. and this is where things start to get weird, somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island, years earlier, when they were only 10. i guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is. so, now, we're in the past, while the girls try to retrace their steps, so these bad guys don't kill them, although, i wouldn't have minded if they had. in the flashback, the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends, eventually stopping by an island for some air, they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents. any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up, but the flashback was undeniably better than the present, which, still, isn't saying much.for a while there i had forgotten about the original story, at one point, i ithought maybe the director had too, and when the flashback ended, that would be the end, which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half-hour shorter. this pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end, and real stuff does happen, but it's stupid. i guess i didn't exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured, or anything like that, but i did expect some form of outlandish b-entertainment, mostly just a confusing, inept storyline, unsure of its genre. my advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like attack of the beast creatures. if anyone, i would only recommend this one to serious b-movie collectors who must have them all, anyone else interested probably has brain damage. what really gets me is that i still have no idea why they called it please don't eat the babies. 3/10

without wishing to be a killjoy, brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i've ever seen - this being one of them, and camp blood being another. the acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this film screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap?i bought this for £1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. you'd do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.

i enjoyed the first reviewer's comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second-run theatre in the early '80's. i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings. but to me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities muffled by the masks, while the direction i think of as being unusually static, and the photography murky. the rating jotted down at the time was a nought, which means "not worth sitting through even once".still, i too would jump at a chance to have a second look.

this is one of those films that i could only sit through once. charlotte henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. the problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen, gary cooper, w.c. fields and cary grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). the movie just clumped along with no cohesion. much of lewis carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. what a pity! it's such a great book. i would recommend disney's 1951 version.

a family moves into a old house in japan. but there's a catch it's haunted (boo!!!). aw, didn't mean to make you jump. it's only a review. settle back down. ahem, now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion. this naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8. horrid acting. horrid story. but how bad can it be you ask? well it was so bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips. it was so bad whenever doug mcclure came on-screen i prayed that i had flashbacks of small wonder (yes, i know doug was in "out of this world" & not "small wonder", but it's pretty much the same damn show, & i can hum the "small wonder" theme better) there are movies that are so bad they're good. this isn't one of thosewhere i saw it: showtime beyondmy grade: f-eye candy: mako hattori gets topless,susan george gets 2 love scenes ( one nude, one just topless)

this is a rotten movie.the cast seem to know just how bad it was.it starts badly and by the end is truly bad.the acting is woeful.the script could of been written on the spot.and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes.crap 1 out of 10

i saw this film at a pre-release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills. as i recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.if the audience wasn't scared, it seems the filmmakers were. they delayed release for over a year. out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as i can tell, they hadn't. it was the same lousy movie, just a year older.it almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good," but it's slow-paced and boring.

aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. i can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a "good movie."

while the premise behind the house where evil dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie. i suppose i'll just number a few of them: 1. the acting  when you see that edward albert, doug mcclure, and susan george (and her teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? not that it matters much to me, but these are hardly a-list names. susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy, but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen. and in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. as for the other two, the less said the better.2. the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at disney world. and, they are about as frightening. and why did they have to be so obvious? subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil dwells.3. the plot  how predictable can one movie be? the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters. if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies.4. the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks? not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over, knocks on the door, and asks if you need help removing evil spirits. absurd is a word that comes to mind.5. everything else  it's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house's architecture. that's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie.i'll stop. you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned. and, i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the crabs or a multitude of other problems. be warned, this thing is horrible.

en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. and that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with joe haggerty, as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson, giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.to be fair, some of sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and joe castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. these positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, the zombie chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.i give the zombie chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3d (although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).

this movie is not based on the bible. it completely leaves christ out of the movie. they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ. let alone talk about it. it does not quote from scriptures. the end times are called the great tribulation. the movie does not even show bad times. the seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure. the anti-christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. the only part they got correct was there was two prophets. the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures. the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie. i wanted to take unsaved people to it. i feel that the movie is evil. it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does. i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books.the second problem with the movie is it was just bad. bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. i have seen better episodes of miami vice.

i would highly recommend seeing this movie. after viewing it, you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie ever saying "at least it wasn't the omega code."forget my money, i want my time back!

i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry. the first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. becoming boring and not funny at all. they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable. i didn't like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either. i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really disappointed.i don't recommend this movie.

i was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons. for the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. in fact i almost thought this would be almost as good as perico ripiao (another recent dominican film) which turned out to be much much better than i expected. the plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in the dominican republic. unfortunately i don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. about 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, cgi effects dating to what i'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. the rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. to top it all off (and i guess i should warn you now **spoiler alert**) it all turns out to be a dream. oh my who didn't see that coming? oh man i almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. well after about an hour into it i start thinking "hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be??" and then it hits me half of the music in the movie was taken from a video game called king of fighter 95.when oh when dr will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?! perhaps a comedy to match france's amelie, or an action flick to match thailand's ong-bak, an animation as akira was to japan, a witty crime thriller as layer cake was to england, or a socio-awakening journey as waking life had here in the states....i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of dr, search los jodedores and you'll know what i'm talking about.

it has a great name, but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone.and yet the producers (roberto angel salcedo) calls him an actor, but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting!!....period. the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing.for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it, but they didn't!! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad, i don't buy it.but hopefully this is as bad as it gets. to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it, that might work out.maka

the film is poorly casted, except for some familiar old hollywood names. other performances by unknown names (i.e., jennifer gabrielle) are uninspiring. i have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay? in a positive note, kim bassinger's and pat morita's performance saved the movie from oblivion. i enjoyed pat more in karate kid, though. there are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them. save your money and the celluloid. jason vanness

one of the worst films i have ever seen. how to define "worst?" i would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again. somehow, one-hit wonder zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends elvis fans, mary kay saleswomen, las vegas, gays, fbi agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy, sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed. how elvis presley enterprises could allow the rights of actual elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be "the only good elvis presley imitator is a dead one" is beyond me. the worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script: in 1958, elvis' words and songs that he would speak/perform in the 1970's are quoted! worst special effect? that oscar would go to the moron who decided that elvis' grave, potentially the most photographed/recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere. potentially, this film's biggest audience would be elvis fans. however, the rampant stupidity (nixon gave elvis a dea badge, not fbi credentials...and i could go on and on) actually undercuts that conventional wisdom. ugh. i used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. this is truly a horrible, horrible film.

i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight. it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer. the plot had potential (who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis impersonator she meets?) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing. towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return, then a group of stars moves together to form an "elvis" constellation, which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators, sending them crashing through the roof. bad...really bad. which is the theme for the whole movie. i'd avoid this one at all costs.

being an elvis fan, i can't understand how this proyect could be done. is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about the king. come on, elvis' grave in a public park? a mention about suspicious minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. some people in the cast tries to do their best, mike starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the tom hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young elvis sucks.overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. if you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis, i truly recommend you "bubba ho-tep" instead of this mess.

darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with odd ties to elvis presley, running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada...and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own. kim basinger, a still-attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to pick quirky movies to play in, but this dreadful screenplay (by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber) hasn't an iota of good humor. the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy, but even on a shambling, shameful level, the picture is crude and sloppy. if you do watch, see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face. hopefully both she and elvis were well paid. no stars from ****

my main comment on this movie is how zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. i have to admit though, tom hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about tom? did you lose a bet? the best cameo of the movie was joe isuzu though - by far a classic! the premise is good. basinger's character, struggling with existence as a pink lady, is making her way toward vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. this happens as corbett's character is on his way to vegas to deliver an elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion. as they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with elvis impersonators who on their way to an elvis impersonating convention in vegas. soon, the fbi gets involved and begins to track what they think is an elvis impersonator serial killer. unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.when watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. it is much more enjoyable to just watch basinger look beautiful in her pink lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. the movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.it isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one don't say i didn't warn you!

omg! the only reason i'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis-in-the-box. apart from that, how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie?? maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time... there are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. now that i think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, joel zwick. he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved. don't waste your time like i did; but then, i enjoy a good train wreck. geez, now the system is telling me i need more lines-- here ya go: this movie should be called return to sender. okay, now that was funnier than anything in the movie...

elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker. scene after scene director joel zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing. filled with unfunny deaths, trite gay characteratures, and hack jokes, this film is more desperate than amusing. this is the sort of film that makes one hope kim basinger follows doris day into premature retirement. let us remember her the way she was (talented) and not what she's become. david leisure, the delicious dennis richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn. the guy playing elvis sounds more like gomer than the king.the only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays basinger as a preteen. she really looks like her and is actually pretty good. the only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the tom hanks cameo. the cameo isn't all that funny, but at least its not painful. one has to wonder if zwick has incriminating pictures of hanks or something that would make him do this movie.

i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom`s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count judging by this film version of tom`s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so i guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . there`s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . it`s inoffensive but i`m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy ?

i notice that the previous reviewer (who appears to be still at school) gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel. the major problem i had with this (1999) version was the casting of anthony way as tom long. anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini-series "the choir". i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in "the choir". unfortunately the small boy who appeared in "the choir" had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time "tom's midnight garden" was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom. it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom (as played by anthony) would befriend the far younger hatty. in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable. for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects. the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic. as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5.00, need i say more?

if you like bad movies, this is the one to see. it's incredibly low-budget special effects (you'll see what i mean) and use of non-actors was what gave this film it's charm. if you're bored with a group of friends, i highly recommend renting this b movie gem. it's mulletrific!

i would love to have that two hours of my life back. it seemed to be several clips from steve's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script. don't go, if you must see it, wait for the video ...

a difficult film to categorize. i was never giving it 110% concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared i couldn't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the american fbi characters & what their roles were. nor could i take the irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows, not acted out.this is nothing more than a glorified episode of a discovery tv show, with a largely insignificant sub plot going on, which just seemed to get in the way. however as any irwin show is always worth a watch, this film is well worth a look too, but not on christmas day. talking of which, i've better things to do too than be on here.a high 4/10

on steve irwin's show, he's hillarious. he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'oh, this is one nasty bloke!' and looking straight into the camera. he put his face in the camera too much! and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead? and terri had the worst acting i'd ever seen! like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says 'steve'. she didn't sound scared or anything, it was just 'steve'. i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing. i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid.

i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy! i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.but, everything in this movie is bad. farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all time.it's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. all the "jokes" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.i'm surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.

gday mates! just watched croc hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. a few things: steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. there was two major cleavage shots in this movie. when terry find that baby joey she goes like "we have to nurture them, just like a baby". woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it pg-13 though. while on terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in queensland, austrailia. i want a koala, dingo, and joey!steve's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!

so, steve irwin. you have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles, and mud, not only daily, but with enthusiasm. he was never able to make me want to do it, but he managed to make his wife come close.this movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled, have a migraine, or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by disney films). it's too noisy. well, steve is too noisy. he's just so happy all the time, and would cut right through the blasé' teenager (i can hear it now: "that movie was so stupid") or the tylenol with codeine. i'd say his enthusiasm is catching, but if it was, i would own a room full of snakes, and that hasn't happened yet. i agreed they're beauties, but i'm still not going to pet them.plot was indeed predictable. bad guys were so bad, for a minute there i thought i was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. but the movie was filled with animals, and steve and terri, which is why i watched it. that plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck. my expectations were low and stayed that way.i was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where steve and terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. i still can't believe we won't see steve anymore. i hope that terri and the children continue to be involved in the australia zoo and the discovery channel, at least. i can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is. crikey!

there's tons of good-looking women in this flick. but alas, this movie is nudity-free. grrrrrrrrrr strike one.ahem. one story in this film takes place in 1971. then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage? hello? continuity, anyone?as you might know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d. and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen. i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this, but there was no 3d, just double-vision blurs. i didn't have the same problem with this company's other 3d movies, hunting season and camp blood. sure, the 3d in those ones sucked too, but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect.this thing is a big ball of nothing.and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame, yum! i'd like to see more of her. in movies, as well. looks like janet margolin at a young age. purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

universal soldier: the return is not the worst movie ever made. no, that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. however, perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier: the return. this film is a sci-fi/action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it. the acting is as bad as any movie i've ever seen. the plot is terrible and predictable. the special effects are pathetic. in short, anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves. us: the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces. some movies are so bad, they're good. believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them. i'm really not sure what else to say here. i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they hadn't already, but just in case: don't.

this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie. cheap looking, and worst of all, boring action scenes! the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence. only 82 minutes, but it feels like it goes on forever! even die-hard van damme fans(like myself) should avoid this one!

i won't add to the plot reviews, it's not very good.very improbable orphanage on bala.cushing and lee at their height.some nice scenery.good for face spotting, and i quote, "look at the mouth, that is cassie from fools and horses".otherwise, a poor example of the british film industry.fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock, keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best.redeeming feature? it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription. i won't be subscribing on this effort.

i actually have a fondness for christopher lee, but this just wasn't up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors.the film does not live up to its premise. it's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. every time i thought, "oh, here comes the good part" the good part never quite arrived.the evil ones aren't at all convincing. most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.perhaps if i'd been in the proper frame of mind, i might have enjoyed some mstie-fication at this film's expense, but.... naaahhh... didn't really seem to be worth the effort. it wasn't really very good, it wasn't really very bad, it was just mediocre.

"three daring daughters" is a sickly sweet, rose-colored look at divorce, remarriage, and single-parent living. obviously, social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then dates and marries a band conductor. even when the "its just a movie" phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems, 'daughters' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself. isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married? admittedly, this movie was released in the nineteen forties. only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make 'daughters' a tolerable film.

in an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says "the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. it is not that well-known. and the exact specifications are a secret. and why is it a secret: well, why should they reveal it back then?? if they where in a space race with the russians, then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation." this is completely incorrect. there is (and was) no "secret" to radiation protection in apollo. the design and construction of the apollo command module has long been publicly available. it uses a lightweight "honeycomb" of aluminum and stainless steel. the entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. these materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x-rays and gamma rays.space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. but it simply wasn't a serious threat to the apollo astronauts. the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the van allen belts. they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less. of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. only two have died from cancer: alan shepard (leukemia) and jack swigert (bone cancer). the rest died from heart attacks, pancreatitis (roosa), and a motorcycle accident (conrad). these are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men now in their late 70s (shepard would be 86).

i am a 11th grader at my high school. in my current world affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch. so we did. i am firm believer that we went to the moon, being that my father works for nasa. even though i think this movie is the biggest piece of crap i have ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. first of all did he have to show jfk getting shot? and how dare he use all those biblical quotes. the only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates, which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates. this movie did nothing to change my mind. i think he and michael moore should be working together and make another movie. michael moore next movie could be called "a funny thing happened on spetember 11th" or "a funny thing happened on the way to the white house".

this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min's there not the 90 min's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray.seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened

i notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. i think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.i was a youngster at the time of apollo, but i was old enough to understand what was going on. the entire world followed the moon landings. our families gathered around the tv to watch the launch. newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages. in school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on tv. during apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. you couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was. the world was truly one community. now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down. we are left with our history books, and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to "prove" it with a bunch of lies and made-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise--not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days.

this so-called "documentary" tries to tell that usa faked the moon-landing. year right.all those who have actually studied the case knows different.first of all: there is definitely proof. when the astronauts was on the moon, they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. these where spread around the world to hundreds of labs, who tested them. and they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. i.e. the conspiracy theorists never studies anything: they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest.another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, i.e. the flag moves. there is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. and what proves this: well, if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage, they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be, i.e. the conspiracy theorists are bad-scientists, they cant study a subject properly, or only studies it until they have what they came for, so that they can make a lie from that, and make a profit (i.e. this so-called "documentary").a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light-sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in an earth desert at night, with no light-sources. but i doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a star treck-convention is held over.the conspiracy theorists are in denial, big time. they only see what they want to see. so they make up all these lies to seem important - that is a fact.

the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. it is a technically adept film.that having been said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program, rather than actual fact. and sibrel's "irrefutable proof" that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics.i do not recommend watching this, but if you do, see it at google video for free. don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity.

this is quite possibly the most retarded 80's slasher ever realized, but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises, taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits? prior to being a horror film, "aerobicide" is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids, silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products. if you'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80's tunes, there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left. plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin (yeah). the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device. several years later people turn up dead in the same spa. you don't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there's a link between the murders and the burning incident, now do you? investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer (and charles napier look-alike!) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80's beauty i've ever seen! looking through the credits, her name's dianne copeland apparently, and she didn't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma-movie called "surf nazis must die". what a wasted opportunity! she may not have been a great actress, but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business. the amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special, neither. we're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh. the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable, but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore, anyway. "aerobicide" (a.k.a. "killer workout") is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night, but nevertheless feel like watching a film! it actually would make a terrific double-feature with "death spa". both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes  and both films are pretty dumb.

what can i say. a kamal hassan movie being horrible. he acts very well, but it is a horrible story, along with horrible direction. in my kind opinion, the director gautham menon must give up directing. there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. apart from that, one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes. there was no practicality in the movie. gautham is just running out of stories. but both kamal hassan and jyothika act really well. the villains look too ugly, though their performance was not bad. i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like padayappa which you can see with the family. you will not get sleep seeing this movie!! however, harris jayaraj again did a great job, and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10. his song 'partha modail nallae' is soulful and soothing. apart from that, great cinematography. on the whole, this is just a bad, bad movie. kamal hassan, i think, should have rejected this movie.

i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations; basically because of kamal hassan. he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever. but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better. the protagonist, raghavan, is a very daring police officer. who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders. raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree. finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives.these two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters. the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly, which the movie could have survived without. to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty. the director, gautham, should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience.certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham's name on the production list.

on the way back from imc6 (san jose, california), all five (mind you, three of us hardcore kamal fans) of us had reached a unanimous verdict; vv was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up monday. not to mention, we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year.i won't blame kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist madan (on vijay tv). he said something like, "tamizh cinema'la photography, editing'la namba munnera'na maadri screenplay, direction, acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved, when it comes to screenplay, direction and acting"). while you're watching vv, those words ring very true.now, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie:1. harris jeyaraj2. harris jeyaraj3. harris jeyaraj i'm barely holding myself from using expletives here, but fact is hj has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his (remember 'anniyan', 'ghajini') with the jarring cacophony, he bills as background music. the next time i have an eardrum transplant, he's paying for it. 4. songs neither do the songs help move the movie's narration spatially/temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice. the film feels like it's made of four very long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them.5. a short gone too far. vv at best is fit to be a short story, not a 2 hour plus "thriller". to use a cliché here, like the energizer bunny it goes on and on and on; only in this case you don't want it to. the later part of a movie feels like a big drag.6. kamal-jothika pairing two ice cubes rubbed together could've produced more sparks than this lead pairing. there's no reason you would root for them to make it together. in fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritant to the narration. hate to say this, but kamalini mukerjhee's 10 minute romancing does more than what kamal and jothika achieve in this movie plus 'thenali'.7. kamal haasan's accent kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in india or in the us; and it isn't new either. he's been doing it since 'thoongadae thambi thoongadae'. it's simply gets on the nerve. imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the us. he doesn't leave it at the immigration either, he offers doses of advice to his men (bewildered tn cops from keeranor, sathoor and beyond) in chaste kamanglish ("wha we hav here is plain bad police wok"), of course with nauseating effect.8. logic there are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale. gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the department of common sense. which d.c.p in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after! the scene inside the theatre was so bad, towards the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the hero's iq. "is he stupid, can't he just use his siren or lights?" (on a busy madras road, kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude!). "can't he just use his gun?" ("the guy on a bike" starts on foot and we have a fully geared kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time). i'm not voting in favour of the later, but i'm just trying to explain the mood inside.9. gore & violence if i wanted to watch women being raped, their throats getting slashed, more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity, i would sit at home and rather watch a "police report" or "kuttram". the use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! somewhere down the line gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rapes, murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is!10. even a double shot espresso couldn't get the pain out of the head.

filmatography: excellent, nice camera angles (i don't remember seeing a movie of late, with good close-ups, until this one). could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera. ny is pictured good.i liked the upside down angles, in particular (a different touch).music: not impressive. songs don't stick around in your mind even after watching the movie. may be, i expected same quality like "anniyan". a disappointment. actors: kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard-core action sequences. his age and belly really show up. also, he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward. it was a very awkward to see a mature/aged star still trying to play like a 20+ heroes scenes. love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you still can express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much. for example, the love expressed by rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi").jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie. not sure why she accepted this. well, that is not my problem, i guess.others just have a small presence.direction: i expected gautham to excel (or measure-up) to his other movie "kakka kakka". he disappointmented me. it took a long time to release the movie due to various issues. he slips in few scenes. even abvious things got slipped from a famous director.overall: just a okay movie. too much graphics. definitely not for kids (and adults who expect some kind of "entertainment").thx

i pity people calling kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood ! comeon guys..this movie is a thriller without thrill..come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs.technically good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer, there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving 3 valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie.kamal at his best is the best in tollywood

it's "the f.b.i." starring reed hadley, with an all-star guest cast! the film begins with an accidental (convenient?) kidnapping, which leads to one thing, and another - which doesn't really indicate the main story, which is a "big house, u.s.a." prison break story. the story is very improbable, to say the least. it's like a tv show, only more "violent" (for the times).but - the cast is a trip! picture this: ralph meeker is sent to prison; his cell-mates are the following criminals: broderick crawford, lon chaney jr., charles bronson (reading a "muscle" magazine!), and william talman (reading a "detective" magazine!). honest! you should know that, an early scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, answering the ending "voiceover." if you don't want to have that hanging, don't miss the opening scenes between the "iceman" and the boy (peter votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic). *** big house, u.s.a. (1955) howard w. koch ~ broderick crawford, ralph meeker, reed hadley

i am definitely a burt reynolds fan, but sorry, this one really stinks. most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie. i can't believe he even made this one. is he actually that hard up for money?

the movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between.but the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable. but krista allen really rocked in the movie .her voice was so seducing and sexy.the scenes in the bed involving krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do.krista really is one of the best in such roles.she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes,which is the interesting part of the movie.burt reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star.he could have chosen a better script than this.ireally think he did for money.

this ranks as one of the worst movies i've seen in years. besides cuba and angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. wasn't archer once a decent actress? what happened to her? the action is decent but completely implausible. the make up is so bad it's worth mentioning. i mean, who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film. someone should tell the make up artist, and the dop that you're not supposed to actually see it. the ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of "and then they realized it was all a dream"don't waste your time or your money. you're better off just staring into space for 2 hours.

you have to figure that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits, you are not in for a good time (the credit reads "cuba gooding, j.r."). some nice car chase, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action if all you want is action, because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best, and completely unbelievable. the motivations of the characters, especially that of gooding's at the end, are worse then unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled. all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project (he can't have something on all of them, can he?).

camera work - why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy? this is annoying and distracting. editing - the flashes of the still pictures were way too short. many of the other scenes were too short also. just flashes. sound - the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices. one should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said. doesn't anybody check these things and make them do it over again. please reduce the volume of the background music in future. is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor, julia wong? the plot had way too many loose ends. the basic story line had potential. i think the film needed more work. was it rushed? perhaps they ran out of money. like a lot of movies, it started out great but just petered out toward the end. i really don't understand this, you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard.sorry to be so critical.

i rented end game, having never heard of it, but i'm fond of political thrillers so i thought i'd give it a shot. after doing some research on the movie, i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release, but instead had gone strait to dvd. after seeing it, i'm thinking, "no wonder." the movie is shocking in its unoriginality. the plot and the characters are perfunctory. i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball. i have to say, i didn't expect it to end quite the way it did, but that's not a point in its favor. the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad. perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist--even one that made the movie even worse.stay away. i want the $5.98 and my 107 minutes back.

please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! the synopsis of the movie is: the first lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her. that's it. undetected by anyone, except cuba and angie, she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about...and gets away completely free.some specific points are particularly hilarious: while standing in front of the president, cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet...which then enters the back of the president's head.cuba and angie watch film from a news camera, and they see...a clue. they go to great lengths to protect the film, believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film.cuba speaks with a presidential staff member. the psm comments that there was no conspiracy. cuba claims there was more than one person involved. the psm then rants that the conspiracy includes the fbi, the cia, and the nsa. gosh, i wonder is the psm is involved.ms archer, the first lady, is a craptacular artist. cuba can't make out a painting, and she says, "you're too close...stand back...look from a different perspective, look from my perspective." can anyone miss that clue?

end game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are given no reason for this apart from, the next scene wouldn't make sense without it. the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr. is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering.the end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever seen......and that's saying something, i've seen gigli.

i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened.....i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else....i tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her? at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth. does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game 2?

cuba gooding jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u.s. president, i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for, and this film shows us why. he teams up with a persistent news reporter (angie harmon) to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah.even with a cast of james woods, cuba gooding jr, anne archer and angie harmon 'end game' fails to grab your attention, plain and simple; some of the action is good, the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - well it doesn't! the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that, at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters.4/10 it's boring, predictable and dull.

i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it. the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching. he's capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together.angie harmon, playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who's behind the assassination of the president, truly butchered the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, her demeanor was flat and wooden, and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd. this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the "b" list.and what was cuba gooding thinking??? he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances, but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from him.poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor.

i argued with myself whether to rent this or not. i'm always afraid of renting something i've never heard of (don't remember this being in theaters). great cast...that's what tipped the scales. 30 minutes in, i almost stopped watching it. the first few minutes are fun to watch, but unbelievable. it only gets worse after that. the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better. or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable. i give it a 3....a 1 for the writing (only because there are words)and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script. oh my god this movie sucks.

poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy, tired of the hollywood glamor treatment. first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli, an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. and now it's europa 51, another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment.nor does the story do much for alexander knox, in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son. at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than stromboli.bergman is still attractive here, but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman. she's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a kindly male friend. "sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind," she tells her husband. a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace, but it does give us a sense of where the story is going.bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war rome, but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse.the film's overall effect is that it's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman. the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she's two-timing him. the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness. the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum.ingrid suffers nobly through it all (over-compensating for the loss of her son) but it's no use. not one of her best flicks, to put it mildly.trivia note: if she wanted neo-realism with mental illness, she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak!! it would have done more for her career than europa 51.summing up: another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman.

maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise carrying on, but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought (and therefore annoying) films i've ever seen. the film starts out promisingly if familiarly, as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son (sandro franchina). whilst mummy and daddy (bland alexander knox) entertain their guests at a dinner party, the youngster tries to kill himself, setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy. spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea (ettore giannini), she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband, who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles. bergman plays the saint role to the hilt, echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc, and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect. unfortunately, the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety, as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes. by the final tear soaked scene, i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters. a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950's flowers of st. francis.

i checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page. it is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud..the only mystery here is how oscar® winner f. murray abraham got involved with such a lousy script!

...ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet, and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was. and i couldn't have been more agree about it. then after that i saw this film on dvd, i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv. luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap. i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy. so i can't be judging on how the film was made, but anyway... it still sucks. as for those who liked this film, i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is. i don't know what do you think about this film?

on the surface, this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation, that is how to become a true self by embracing the so-called 'dark' side of human nature. thus, we have the darkling, a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company (that is, recognition) of men, and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled, more or less successfully. however, if we dig a little deeper, we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person: - in the opening scene, the main character (male car mechanic fallen from grace)is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter, when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl. lesson #1: cars are persons embodied with immortal souls, and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery. the wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished. - just after that, another character (rubin) buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once-lost-now-found famous race-car and is warned by the salesman. lesson #2: just like any other person, a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced. in addition, there is the twist that rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk, but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of rubin's own personal greed for more profit. lesson #3: thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only, but always as an end in itself. - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to rubin and, more importantly, rubin's car: the main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance, but also by a thorough look inside the engine room. lesson #4: a car is not just to be judged by its looks, it is what is inside that really counts. there is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind, as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell rubin a fake collector's car. this scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson #3. there are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car=person'-theme, and i am too tired now to bother citing all of them, but the point remains (and i guess this is what i'm really trying to say) that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or, if you're a car devotee.

first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges. sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. however, it wasn't the preston sturges, it was preston sturges, jr. the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson's short story "the bottle imp". a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. that's fine. nobody said screenwriters had to be original. the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. my biggest complaint comes with the ending. the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film. this is a stupid convention. the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end. there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end. in fact, i think it's preferable.

the darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while f. murray abraham was in it. spoilers: about halfway through, f.murray gets zapped, because the darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. he takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success. he feeds from their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins. however, part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. otherwise he cannot "pervert" their natural goodness. that's what the little guy said in his barry white voice, which i found both charming and amusing. mostly amusing. like imagine barry white if he were a little dwarf and he was telling aiden gillen "dee plane, dee plane, bos, here eet come, dee plane!" all through the movie, dee dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) talks to aiden gillen in the barry white voice, saying things like "it's ok to be bad, you know you want it." "now you've committed murder, you're really moving up in the world" and other remarks that sound like commercials for "being evil" stores or something. it really is hilarious in a sick way.anyhow, aiden gillen is no f. murray abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as murray gets the axe (or knifed?). f. murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. he is a good actor. aiden gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face, and he looks like maybe his remedial english comp. class had never hit the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. the ending is really creepy and yet almost comical. if this movie were a parody, the ending was perfect. if it was not a parody, then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. the people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. it just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending.

yes, i sat through the whole thing, god knows why.it was a long afternoon, i had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones i have.i gave the darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - i have seen worse films, but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom--poor script, poor acting, bad lighting, and cheesy special effects.the storyline, which never completely makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, daddy, mommy, and little girl--that i assume the viewer is supposed to be "identifying" with, all three of them were tedious and annoying. you just want the dark side to get every one of them.daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. daddy meets a rich man named rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the "mysterious" orient. rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as "the darkling". during the course of the film, the darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the devil. so take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, it doesn't really matter.the darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. this, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with the darkling.and for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, tedious movie.

the film is about sir christopher strong (mp--member of parliament--played by colin clive) and his affair with the amelia earhart-like character played by katherine hepburn. up until they met, he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating hepburn, he "couldn't help himself" and they fell in love. you can tell, because they stare off into space a lot and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love is. frankly, this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch. part of the problem is that in the pre-code days, films glamorizing adultery were very common. plus, even if you accept this morally suspect subject, the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel...and a really bad one at that. sticky and with difficult to like characters (after all, clive's wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm) make this one a big waste of time. about the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume! you've gotta see it to believe it--and she looks like one of the bugaloos (an obscure, but fitting reference).

merry madcaps in london stage a treasure hunt, with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong, independent lady-flier who's never been in love. intriguing early vehicle for katharine hepburn, playing an amelia earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man. the director (dorothy arzner) and the screenwriter (zoe akins, who adapted gilbert frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts? billie burke plays the type of simpering, weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong, and hepburn's final scene is another bummer. a curious artifact, but not a classic for kate-watchers. ** from ****

dialogue: stilted, clichéd; acting: hammy, clichéd; plot: predictable, clichéd.just what are christopher plummer nastassia kinski doing in this "b" rubbish? plummer was well established decades before this movie was made, kinski had masterpieces like "tess" and "cat people" behind her... must have been desperate.the bad guys all have bad-guy accents - *bad* bad-guy accents! (plummer especially! where *did* he learn to do "german"?) and most of them have bad-guy sneers as well. the innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh. the good guy survives, amongst other things: * a 5" throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all; * marines' machine-gun fire (i think someone referred to a .50) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp; * several fist-fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium-first into a door frame; * a fall, backwards, from what looks like the third floor, onto paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience. the script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring.ok it's not all bad. plummer does bring a certain class to his part, and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick. of course that doesn't say much, but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here. he delivers his "ve haff vays and meance" type lines with some menace, but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain.this movie is truly an awful waste of time. the acting, such as it is, is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee's very obviously faked fight scenes, but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore 007 or a bruce lee film. don't bother.

but thomas ian griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has, granted this was made 5+ years ago. some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action, but comedy. and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow? plummer's character was so corny, he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon. personally, if action flicks are going to show skin -- i'd have liked to have seen equal time between female/male, otherwise don't show any.

it's die hard meets cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to one cop, jack (crackerjack) to stop this.a b-action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. thomas ian griffith as the cop and nastasja kinski and christopher plummer as terrorists. if you don't like stupid b-action movies this is not for you.

maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check! isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  check! tasty looking love interest  check! assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents  check! german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check! corny one liners  check!deary me, does this film take the wee wee or what? the clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is!in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain (complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid) we have all the usual action move cliché's ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off.jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point.in amidst this mess, there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and/or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects.looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels, i have got to find these gems on dvd! it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel, well goodness knows! one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third instalment.still, blind purchases of cheap dvd's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep trotting out material of this awful quality!!

wow and i thought that any steven segal movie was bad. every time i thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong. the story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off. also, they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done. for instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for. the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was. the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff, so that almost seemed depressing. i thought that the characters wern't explained well enough. you didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them.

where to start? this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the editing is the worst ever, the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked. most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects, with muddled talking in the background. i had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on....and what was i supposed to hear exactly? probably one of the worst scripts ever made. i can't believe people actually put up some green for this film. it makes me think i could take a crap in a box, send it to producers, and then have them finance a movie for me.dolph, was a usual, dolph. nothing else needs to be said. the villains were bad, the protagonists were bad, and the movie was a stinker. if you really want to know what not to do when either writing, directing or editing a movie, watch this!

this movie had the potential to be really good, considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner the hidden. and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles. but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one.dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!) who travels to new york to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. he must battle the minion, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell. the minion, naturally, wants the key so it can let the antichrist out. along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies.if i'm making this sound entertaining, forget it. the pacing is very awkward and sluggish, the acting subpar at best, and the fight scenes staged poorly. dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career.the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery, but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest.too bad, i really wanted to like this.

i can't think of much to say about this film. this was an awful movie...i can't even tell you what made me decide to view it. it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to begin.the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd. my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done. by the end of the movie, i found myself feeling beyond relieved. the editing was poor, the acting was sub-par, and the storyline was weak. francoise robinson was cast as a native american, even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage. if a movie is going to be this idiotic, it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least. it wasn't. it was just pathetic.

not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. the director is not even canadian, but british, and boy does it show. we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. of course the british character is normal. the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say "norm!!"? the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. the actors always seem to be fidgetting. are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films. a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes.

this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine, moronic idiots. the men get stoned/drunk, and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene. the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus, or worse, milling around like mesmerized cattle. apparently, canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks. it's the standard knocked-up girlfriend, her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before.every character here is a carping, infantile stereotype. not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower! and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag! i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this. maybe he needed the money. ian tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment, but his talent is wasted here.as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or karl  who is dead, but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind (almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock's masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films), why even bother? karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying.by the end of this wretched movie, i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat!

i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored. how can people possibly give this a 10? it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel-good redemption film (i think), because it doesn't work on that level either. weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there's just nothing there. harvey keitel is decent, but has nothing to work with, and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible. the plot progression (especially the relationship between byron and ashley) makes no sense. it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it, without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow. it's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.

might contain possible spoilers (not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: the voices don't even remotely match up and iago is evil again (since when?!) i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films. even the movie's musical number (which had been disney's specialty for years) stunk. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young. all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality.

have not watched kids films for some years, so i missed "here come the tigers" when it first came out. (never even saw "bad news bears" even though in the '70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie, "warriors," "man who would be king," and "rocky horror picture show," among others.) now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on. just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job. lo and behold, i spied wes craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer. he'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the "scream" movies. maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. more surprising was fred j. lincoln in the cast credits as "aesop," a wacky character in the movie. f.j. lincoln, from the '70s to just a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films. he was associated with the adult spoof "the ozporns," and just that title is funnier than all of "tigers" attempts at humor combined. let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel.

the saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes i'll never get back. i knew this was terrible from the get-go, with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof. (see if they could get away with that in 2008). my 10-year-old boy is really into baseball right now, so we decided to rent it on a rainy day. even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it, i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language. bad, bad movie. this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears. completely shameless and completely predictable. i don't mind a predictable movie if it's done well, but this one absolutely was not.

the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it(the crazy filmdirector)the rest of the movie was just boring.in the first hour or so nothing really happens.jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting.julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck (yeah right!) into the girl next door (where did i see this before?) who gets the guy.for short.i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters.if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch.

check out the film's website, more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie. it couldn't be more off in it's boasting. original story? original? they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament, or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting. high-end special effects? come on, i could do better with an atari 7600 and a jug of earwax. stylish cinematography? oh yes, the america's funniest home video look is still a classic. i'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the sf aren't really that good, or a bit bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money. 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and done-already's.

i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this. only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this. this is supposed to be a horror movie but there's only filth in this. the most cool scene is the car accident, with real special effects from the best of hollywood. avoid this movie at all costs. see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie................

this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. all aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. the acting by the three leads is wooden. i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work. lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction. jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers. the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen, the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange. the dvd transfer is typical alpha.

this was a disappointing film for me. it came to me via a boxed set entitled, "classic film noir," which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style (i insist that noir is a style, not a genre). i do not think it is a noir film at all. there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. there is a persecuted male protagonist, ed cullen (lee j. cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. those are just about the only noir elements that i could see. there is no pervasive paranoia, or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed cullen. jane wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers. however, i would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it.

maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews - and i just don't get it. i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak, look, and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura. none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it. take the lead actor, lee j. cobb. his rumpled, rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing, smooth-talking noir archetype as you'll find. or, take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example. this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i've seen in a while. she's just not convincing in the role.as for the plot, it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre. i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes. and that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull. ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it.

i watched like 8 or 9 herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.i watched several documentaries about him. he is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. definitely no! a complete anti-talent. he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors  never!he can't direct nor write. his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word "art" in any sense. no way. not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store. who is he kidding?he is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising. never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction.just look at julio medem. if herzog can make a movie like medem can, then i might re-check his old movies and try to find talent in them.

lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie . i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u.......................................this movie really waste yours time and money . i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema-hall......................................................role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie . i think sanjay-dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi........................character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one .this movie show u the result of over-confidence .........the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing..................a really very big disappointment

the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema. all i have ever seen were few older movies of s.ray.browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of 8.7 i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment. oh my how wrong i was! the only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies.with this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on imdb list of 250 best movies above citizen cane, goodfellas of psycho! i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience. my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is -- plain stupid, with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music.

i love the munna bhai mbbs but "lagge raho..." sux really sux. i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life. and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers ?? **may be spoiler** an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai, people discussing their personal prob. on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ??? i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible.2 out of 10. (2 stars is for 15 mins good starting)

let's see where to begin... bad acting; i'm not sure if i'd even call it that, as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters.to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.budget? did this movie even have a budget? it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home-shot youtube video. bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so, but there was no life to this flick; i don't care who directed it.i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. check the ratings, you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between. wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time. what a suck-fest!

this is a film that makes you say 2 things... 1) i can do much better than this( acting,writing and directing) 2) this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others...looks as if it was shot with my flip video. i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me. i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film. one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen. hopefully the writers and director leave the business. not even talented enough to do commercials!!!!!

with a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler, 'the art of seduction' fails to deliver the romantic, sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as. the two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead are "swinging singles (or in the female lead's case, engaged)", but 'the art of seduction' doesn't even try. shirking from a frank examination of these two characters' personalities, 'the art of seduction' eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin, lean stereotype. 'the art of seduction' is insulting - insulting to its characters, insulting to men and women, and insulting to its audiences' expectations. it takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them. ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. the viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she's pretty. min-jun, well, he's exactly the same. neither are nice people. the "humour" in this film primarily revolve around ji-wan and min-jun's outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation. no character development occurs, and we never learn why ji-wan and min-jun are like this. we are simply expected to take them as they are, and not ask questions - they're cute!, and that's all that matters. the copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester's reviews may tip you off to 'art of seduction's shallowness. if you're still in high school, you liked grease, or you are a yellow fever victim, you may like this movie.despite its "romance" tag, this is not a very good date movie.

a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of james hetfield's slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think, `why am i watching this?' that question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit play. i gave the tape back the same day, as you would suspect, not worth buying or watching!just my opinion!

bill (buddy rogers) is sent to new york by his uncle (richard tucker) to experience life before he inherits $25million. his uncle has paid 3 women jacqui (kathryn crawford), maxine (josephine dunn) and pauline (carole lombard) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers. one such lady cleo (geneva mitchell) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women. we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york, while bill meets with cleo and another woman. at the end, love is in the air for bill and one other .............the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film. the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice. rogers isn't that good either. he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone. there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver (roscoe karns) and the film is just dull.

i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel...so invariably my expectations were crushed. but they were crushed more than should be expected. the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand, which perhaps ruined it for me.in any event, for some reason they changed the labor camp at toulon to a ship full of galley slaves. the scene at bishop myriel's was fine. in fact, other than the galleys, things survived up until the dismissal of fantine. because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman, she does not cut her hair, sell her teeth, or become a prostitute. the worst she does is run into the mayor's office and spit on his face. bamatabois is entirely eliminated. because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about, tholomyes is fantine's dead husband, rather than an irresponsible dandy. valjean is able to fetch cosette for fantine before the champmathieu affair, so they reunite happily, yet another change. then comes the convent, which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up. thankfully, it was saved. after this three minutes of accuracy, however, the movie again begins to hurtle towards classic novel butchering.as cosette and valjean are riding through the park, they come across marius giving a speech at a meeting. about prison reform. when he comes to hand out fliers to valjean and cosette, he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set. "we aren't revolutionaries." i could hear victor hugo thrashing in his grave. of course they are revolutionaries! they want to revolt against the pseudo-monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic, you dumb screenwriters! it's a historical fact that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832. at one point cosette goes to give marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets eponine. except...not eponine. or at least not the eponine of the book. this eponine appears to be a well-to-do secretary girl working for the prison reformers (who are working out of the cafe universal as opposed to the cafe musain). not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not-period, low-cut, tight-fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms.the prison reformers (lead by the most poorly cast enjolras that i have ever seen) decide that handing out pamphlets isn't good enough anymore. so they're going to build barricades. i don't know about you, but i have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops. about three hundred people (it was not supposed to be so many) start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of barricades, etc. eponine does die for marius, thankfully. the rest of the movie is sort of accurate, except that javert's suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation. the movie ends with valjean watching javert jump into the river. this is again inaccurate because valjean would never have let javert drown. he saved the man's life earlier, why let him die now? then there's the whole skipping of valjean's confession to marius, his deterioration, and his redemption on his deathbed with marius and cosette by his side.overall, i can blame the script mostly for the problems. while i am glad enjolras and eponine were at least present in the film, they were terribly misinterpreted, as was the entire barricade scene. the elimination of fantine's suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her. that cosette knows valjean's past from the start messes with the plot a good deal. i did not even see thenardier, and mme. thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time. the same with gavroche. i did like frederich march's interpretation of valjean a lot, however, which was one of the redeeming features of the movie. on the other hand, charles laughton, for all his great acting in other movies, seems to have missed the mark with javert. the lip tremble, the unnecessary shouting, and his acting in general all just felt very wrong. he also, like many javerts i have seen, did not appear at all menacing, something required of the character.again, this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book. i would not recommend it to book purists, though. i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate french version come out the year before.

here's an indie film i really wanted to like, but ultimately could not. the lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through and kills the picture. the story is a nonsensical mess that isn't worth trying to figure out. i quickly became bored within 10 minutes, then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes--hoping for the best--before hitting the chapter stops to (mercifully) get to the end... even that wasn't worth the extra effort. ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever, lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix. as a result, there's very little in ozark savage that hasn't been done before, and better. this film would have been much more fun as a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it just feels padded and forced. of course, there's no money in shorts, so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75+ minutes. director matt steinauer shows great promise, and i wish him luck.

many people thought that this is a good movie but i don't agree with them. at the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, then hey killed some people on the earth, but for no reason. also, it is in a dark forest, i can't see anything on the screen, i can only hardly hear the sound.after a few days, the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on the earth, so there is a contradiction. finally, the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason. he was not live on earth, t is none of his business about the things happened here. lastly, the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long, the summary is too short and it can't tell the reviewers about the story clearly.in conclusion, i don't think this is a good movie.

i'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece. it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica, down to the porn-flic soundtrack. there was no look at what made dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. nothing but "look at how creepy this guy is." and i have to give the filmmakers this much -- their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen.

dahmer, a young confused man. dahmer, a confusing movie. granted, i had a few beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick.its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. the inbetween stuff, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time. we never see actual murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing, but you know he isn't, since it'sbased on a true story and this actually happened, at least most of it. but what happened? it's not easy to tell.i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. ididn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended. */*****

i really felt cheated after seeing this picture. it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing. i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this. it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending. it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel. it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos. it ends suddenly, and you know there's going to be another episode next week. it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie. there are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they didn't know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a dahmer 2. after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate. i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods. all of a sudden i hear this music playing, then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34. wow, he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail. how about showing how he got there. how about showing dahmer's trial. how about showing some more detail. i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place. i actually found myself saying in disbelief, "that's it, that's the end?" i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made. to the filmmakers i'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.

this was a truly bad film. the character "cole" played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped, the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil, it didn't. after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance, this would have added some sincerity.- 1) badly acted - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) razor thin plot lineyuck!

the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used. if ms. pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer.otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies. as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value, which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get. perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to "de-commercialize" their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing - movies by definition are a commercial thing....

saw in on tv late last night. yeah, i can hear what y'all say about this one. it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series. in all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying, "well, that's not what i expected." but, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. rated r?? oh, that scene. did we need it? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched. and what was the title again?

this is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a canadian. we grow good wine. our writers and poets are among the world's best. the national ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. but we make bloody awful movies! this one isn't especially bad. it's especially typical and typically bad, shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction, high school level acting and "gee whiz...lets see what this button on the camera does??" photography. if michael moriarity was so intent on doing a jack nicholson impersonation, couldn't he at least have done a good jack nicholson impersonation? and if the movie was shot in vancouver, truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building (part of the "plot") why in god's name do we let that endemic canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as seattle??? not only am i mad about this film, i'm embarassed and more than a little ashamed. the australians turn out some splendid stuff. we produce pretentious second rate piffle. gawd!!!!!

taped this late night movie when i was in grade 11, watched it on fast forward. i sugest you do the same. i though it would be and action film, but went to a cort tv type movie. in the end it fits in with the early 70's social activest type films. glad i missed that era. 2/10

once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h. beam piper who wrote a classic book named "little fuzzy" which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. mr. piper died in 1964, but hollywood and many of today's authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold. this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks from.skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of "little fuzzy" i can wonder why i'm the only who's ever noticed?but don't take my word for it. here's a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of "little fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137

skullduggery is a strange, strange film based on the novel "ye shall know them" by vercors. to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind, since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance. but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, skullduggery simply isn't a very good film. for me, the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message. the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk; later it teeters into sci-fi fable; by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics. the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great, too jarring, to overlook. they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled, disorganised movie.an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple (burt reynolds). one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame (susan clark). after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures. these primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man. there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the "missing link" in the evolution of apes into humans. or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual? or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics? the archaeologists call the tribe "the tropi" and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery. but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen (paul hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers. he questions whether the tropi are truly "human" and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.this was a very early film in reynolds' career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously. not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick. his character and the film are not relevant to each other. clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox, alexander knox and wilfrid hyde-white. a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance. rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuck-on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical. and that's just not the right idea. we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures, but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant, philosophical and stimulating. the honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result doesn't do them justice. a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless.

the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine. all i can say is, it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. as far as i could tell, borgnine was the only actor in it. the other performances were so uniformly terrible, i am amazed a studio would actually pay the "performers" to appear. couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children, and to its credit, it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid-focused networks. but honestly, that is not saying much.

honestly, where can i begin! this was a low budget, horribly acted film, it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was! the sword fighting scenes weren't even sword fights, they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling!! me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there it was the sawtooth island movie. i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene.oh and the plot of the film, the story board, the script, etc..was a bunch of garbage that i don't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it!! but if you happen to stumble upon this movie..do not get it!!!!!

over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids, i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy, direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through (for anyone over the age of eight). i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me "what did she say that for?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes. and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply "bringing realism" to a film, please run them through with a dull butter knife. "prehysteria!" was head and shoulders above this. arrgh.

you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. this one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). plus, every time i see mercedes mcnab (the sister) i keep thinking 'watch out! she's a vamp!"- for those that know buffy/angel.a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick, the little that was spent of course. i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money.i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity, but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it...umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go.

while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing, i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery. perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age: the movie was made, as it is now 2002, an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings, and science fiction feats like star wars, as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey.my beef, basically, is that i couldn't relate --i am just about the same age of the children (a young adult), and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available. but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence. i didn't find myself saying 'ack! i would have done the same thing!'. it did not open the doors to my imagination. even without comparing it to high-budget films or other tv movies, standing alone, certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche: the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking, seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run. even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement: a typical set of one or the other stereotypes. there was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious, accompanied by mr. perfect image of combining athletics, good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude, and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days. while i know the personalities pushed the story along, i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable --and believable (as far as character)-- movie.i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me. don't get me wrong: all movies are worth seeing for yourself, and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many, but i think that with a little more depth to the script, and a little more (i cannot believe i am saying this) realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical.

this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling.the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also no real suspense.washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it, there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast.the story simply falls a little flat, even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact, you don't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare.there is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships carter but this seems forced.it's an ok film but instantly forgettable.

fairly good movie, but not a true story.rubin "hurricane" carter was a notorius liar, a murder and was never found not guilty. new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone. carter got an offer in 1976: "pass a lie test and go free". he didn't take it. this film should never have been made, but money talks. a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white. why choose a fake story?jens

this movie looks like it was made for tv . for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter, because i loved to see him box at the old msg, and to see this movie was very disappointing.i have alot of respect for mr washington, but he was awful and boring.there is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song.

denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie. someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes. that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.so first it confuses you and then it puts you off. the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve.of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. granted, it does that so if you are looking for that ... knock yourself out.

when i saw this movie i heard all the hype, and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent. i was wrong. i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community (if they are not african americans themselves). i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won. sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture. the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*semi-spoiler*) hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.denzel washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever. i was bored with him in the movie, and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good. the audience is supposed to leave believing this man, rubin carter, is a saint. people left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.*spoilers* this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit. of course the crimes he did commit (stealing mostly) was only to survive, nothing more. people felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view. i do not like movies (especially hollywood interpretations) that are based on "true" stories because they usually distort the "true" parts into something else, something not so true. this was his point of view and a hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably. well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man. not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people. if you do not believe me, search for him on the internet, and read the articles some people have of him. the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it. besides that, there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie. the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their "nice and perfect" persona looked difficult to keep up.this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully. denzel's acting is stale, and the supporting cast's mickey mouse attitudes are annoying. the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.

if this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on "facts" that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter. many of the smaller facts were disregarded (carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of "racist" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to giardello. why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. ruben carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. everyone knows that jewison can direct, and washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself? now thats inspirational) based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, i would suggest passing on this one.

this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with. saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent, stayed up late to do so, was very annoyed to find that it was about 95% romance,4% everything else, 1% history if that. it's what i call a bait and switch movie, one with an interesting title, the actual movie is a scam. this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment, this movie is almost an insult to those who served. the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes, they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france. and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter's character. flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls, an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn't have lasted two days, it would have either been the stockade or the infantry. discipline in the french army was often rather fierce. in short, another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment.

probably the worst film i've ever seen, the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep. the only good actor was colm meaney. i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end, no emotion, no charisma...nothing !

i had high hopes for this film, because i thought clean, shaven (kerrigan's first feature) was absolutely terrific, the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i'd ever seen.but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat. scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix, without much thought for narrative or character.is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? hard to tell. why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life? why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle? why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color? why does claire accept some johns and not others? the filmmaker doesn't seem to know.it feels as if everything is improvised (though i understand this wasn't the case) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary.after the screening i saw, kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative. it sounded like learned rhetoric. i think it was a cop-out.i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean, shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old "political" cliches.

this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii. i was under ten years of age. and that's the audience this serial is designed for. looking at it now, one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity. the budget must have been next to nothing, given the shortcuts and repeats. the acting? well, this is republic pictures, 1944. they read the lines....and no doubt had one take to make them convincing.one and half stars.

like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film, especially the "film makers were then attacked" aspect that the case seems to emphasize, what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob.then, to watch the film and discover, oh, what they mean by "the film makers were attacked" was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said "someone should beat those two kids up." the picture on the cover, "the chase" as it were? total fabrication. which i guess ties in with the theme of the film, lying and manipulation to satisfy vain, stupid children with more money and time then sense.i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. it's like michael moore's "roger & me", but if "roger & me" was moore mocking the people of flint. it's completely misdirected and totally inane. wow! can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? what jerks! and it's not so much, "look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah", since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors, it was that, as many people in the film say, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. that's not proving anything except that people who are poor, will go to a store that has low prices, bravo fellas, way to stick it to the people on the bottom.way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. you should be very proud. how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then, say, "haha! no such house exists! your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media!".morgan "please like me" spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him.avoid like the plague.

the main problem with the documentary "czech dream" is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying.in an audacious - i hesitate to use the word "inspired" - act of street theater, vit klusak and filip remunda, two student filmmakers from the czech republic, pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie: they deliberately fabricated a phony "hypermarket" (the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store), built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards, radio and tv spots, an official logo, a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many "dopes" would show up to their creation on opening day. they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed.one might well ask, "why do such a thing?" well, that's a very good question, but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one. essentially, we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that's not true - simply through the power of advertising. and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the "real" (i.e. higher) purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union. fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers, all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of "research" into what does and does not work in advertising. in a way, by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments, these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse.but, in many ways, the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target, it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it. for it is they themselves and not the good-hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here, as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people, some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot. and what is all this supposed to prove anyway? that people are "greedy" because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains? or that they're stupid and gullible because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised? such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world.no, i'm afraid this smart-alecky, nasty little "stunt" only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots. and, indeed many of them, when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them, react with a graciousness and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position.i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but, when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes, we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed.

loved the original story, had very high expectations for the film (especially since barker was raving about it in interviews), finally saw it and what can i say? it was a total mess! the directing is all over the place, the acting was atrocious, the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat, empty and completely unnecessary (whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense? it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson/smashing pumpkins/placebo music video). whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously laughable (the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi's death was just stupidly funny). it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense, totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more. no explanations were given whatsoever, i mean i knew what was happening only as i'd read the story but for people who hadn't it's even more confusing as at times even i didn't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time.god, i really wanted to like this film as i'm a huge fan of barker's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie, hell i even enjoyed some of kitamura's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- i didn't care about anyone or anything, the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source, turning it into something else entirely. granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass, but everything else was all over the place, more than disappointing. gutted

i heard and read many praising things about "midnight meat train", which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original "hellraiser" that he directed himself, but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience. the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is: nauseating! the violence is sadistic and extreme, which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts, but it's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative. normally speaking, i'm very pro-violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose. the butchering  literally  depicted in "midnight meat train" is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs, and even that isn't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects. there are more shortcomings, some even bigger than the pointless gore, but perhaps i should focus on the good elements first. the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences (like the chase in the freezer room, for example) are literally oozing with nail-biting suspense and macabre atmosphere. unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted. presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities, but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones. the plot introduces leon, an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures. leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train. leon's right, as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer, but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the rails at night. "midnight meat train" takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs, plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images (like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood), but director ryûhei kitamura ("versus", "godzilla final wars") doesn't take full advantage of it all. the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and, even if clive barker meant to have like this, i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale. "midnight meat train" is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film, but not without defaults. it's not intended for easily offended viewers, but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well.

i don't know why, but i thought i've seen this movie before. maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don't know. anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. and even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don't watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. but the rest of it is not so good. laughable at times. the movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about. characters are not great either. all of them. the butcher is ok, seems creepy and crazy enough. although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? the main lead is plain. his character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. but i guess thats scenarists fault. like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? side cast is bad too. but the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. my god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? its ridiculous. the girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. why don't we just go and take it! i know where the maniac lives! yup! thats swell! and then look for the camera in the bathroom! why not? and then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. maybe camera is there? not there. but loads of interesting stuff. shiny. mmmm. to realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. then of course the never ending "falling while running away" trick, that really made it look bad. then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon full with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams "noooo" like she just ripped her gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... jeez. come on. no one else thinks its just, well, stupid? just awful. if her character wasn't so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. and i would even forgive mmt characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn't read clive barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). oh, and the predictable ending. damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. the only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months. visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good cgi that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn't look real at all) i guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.

ok, so i just saw the movie, although it appeared last year... i thought that it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible... first of all, we never get to know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, wtf are they doing in our world, and really, have they been on earth before we were or did they just come from space? secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created... really, how large could the underground for a sub station could have been? there were only so many of those creatures, so i think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clear the are and a nuke would have done the job. i know it sounds funny and it is, but i do not see the killing of people as being necessary... thirdly, leon acts like superman jumping on the train and fighting vinnie jones, who was way taller and bigger in stature. then again, when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp, watching all the abominations. i mean ok, the conductor had creepy help(lol), but if leon was so brave he would have gone all the way... i mean he risks his life first, then does nothing exactly when he should have. he could have died as a hero but lives as a coward... this might be the case, but not after showing so much braveness earlier on... then, the cop thing... come on! this was a city having a subway, i bet there must have been other cops except that lady, other police stations,this was really kind of silly... all in all, great acting by vinnie jones, interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all... by the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? vinnie jones cannot make up for the rest...

i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. if you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. however, for the first time ever, i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over.i love bad movies. to me, ed wood is a genius, i thought bloody murder, jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good. however, there is not a single good thing i can say about this film.the plot is basically non existent. if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it, they can discern for themselves what the plot might be, but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie.the special effects are bad.the acting is bad.the two leads are attractive, but that's all there is.i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it. i will tell you anything.i love bad movies, and i love horror and i love new inventive movies. i even love horror porn stuff like hostel (which some reviewers claimed this was like, but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2). but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made.and before you disregard this review, this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead, but actually bought a copy of it.

it was no sense and it was so awful... i think hollywood have a lot of film like that... you don't have do watch it. people cutter or eater what should i say... it made me sick! oh my god! film is about people that we don't know but feed themselves with humans! they have teeths bla bla bla... isn't that familiar? i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie. the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful. and i should say that bradley cooper was totally awesome... he's so talented... actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes... let me explain it. did you ever eat tongue? but in the film one person did it! it was really awful... anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes...

i have heard a lot about this film, with people writing me telling me i should see it, as i am a fan of extremely bloody, gory movies. i got my hands on it almost right away, but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now. i would have been better off not remembering i even had it.this movie was atrocious. the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was. i know it was a story by clive barker and all, and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be, as i was, completely clueless and utterly disappointed.the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing, the story interesting. the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention. i thought the blood looked a bit bad, but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on. i was wrong. the blood and effects are so horrible, it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that, for instance, someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer. wtf? cgi blood (did they even use any "real" blood at all? my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film!), unbelievable acts of dismemberment (eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies?!), too-dark scenes (every scene is either an odd yellow color, or in hidden in shadows)...it just gets worse and worse. i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake. there's just too much. add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end...no thank you! it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok, with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer. maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant? plausible, doable...and a lot better i think than the "real" story. that could have and should have worked. instead it became a "creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you, and unless you read the book, well...you just won't ever understand it" fiasco. tragic, what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential. if you like mindless fake blood and gore, you'll love this. but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it. stay away- far, far away.

this was a terrible film. there was no story line whatsoever. to top it all off, when they couldn't explain the blood and gore (the only good part) ... they threw in a few aliens! i hate when directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! watch this film if you like. but don't say i didn't warn you. two things: how could vinny say "welcome" when he didn't have a tongue? its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role. second thing that bugged me, why were we shown vinny jones' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid, then these have no further role. why not? i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever. in short. bad story. i wouldn't waste my time - wish i'd have watched mirrors instead.

where to start. the film started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock. the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in. it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by.the actors gave an average performance in this movie however, i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film.as the film dragged on, and take my word for it, it dragged on, it just got more and more far fetched.*** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** spoiler alert *** just when i thought the film could not get any worse, towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up, just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all. it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end. the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was. once the lead role disposes of vinny jones, he becomes the new killer.in closing, this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made. i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie!!

i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! i haven't seen such a bad movie for years.omg this was a really bad movie. splatter, is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). if you didn't like hostel2 or wolf creek or halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. the story remind me rl stine goosebumps.!i can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.cliché all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.)==here comes spoilers==the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. actually those people are just missing. and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!

i would just like it to be known, that i do not often rate movies below a 5. i was originally very excited to see this movie. its numerous trailer bumps on tv for several months made me reaally want to see this movie. so, the other night when i saw that it was available on fearnet on demand, i got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.the storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. there's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. where are they going? what's happening to them? one day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. the film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. "oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" i say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.the plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. "this was good until the end.... then it just got silly", says jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. and i fully agree. and here come the spoilers...see, i was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. no. it was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. woo. how original. how unrealistic. how dull.3/10. come on lionsgate. you've had amazing films, but this one sunk.

do not bother to waste your money on this movie. do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. if you must see a movie this weekend, go see batman again.the script was horrible. perfectly written from the random horror movie format. given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. mix together, add much poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little "spin" to the plot.the acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - borat was more believable than this.***spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? i'm in the army. we need that kind of stuff for ourselves.1 out of 10, and i would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score i can.

wow, how bad can it get. this was seriously bad. not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable cgi - but in acting, atmosphere and direction.the story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke. within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones, he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. um... are all new york photographers this childish, suggestible and weak? his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable, and totally absurd twist his character takes.the gory moments were clearly just a weak, low-self-esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon - all cgi, blood yet no real emotion whatsoever. these parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - wacky camera angles etc.overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. what could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self-conscious directing. this film wasn't made for and audience - it was made for a cv - a deeply selfish motive.

i often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, i write the review to balance unwarranted raves. i found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers. whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. individually, june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. they're both bland. i like billy gray, but his character is pretty one-note. the best part of the film, to me, are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body.

i was never so bored in my life. hours of pretentious, self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems. it's like watching lizards molt. even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy. if you have insomnia, rent this.

one previous reviewer called this film "pure visual joy" i am wondering if s/he saw the same film that i did. "high art" had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since "seven". one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the cliché of going to a b&b for their first time. of course, before they do that, one has to watch opium-den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit. not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types, the girlfriend/boyfriend at start, who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so. the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now. what did she do, retire at age twenty?

this woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. so she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. this movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. the problem i had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. if they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. every time i thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. it was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. it pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. the lesbian stuff didn't bother me. i was looking for a movie about art. i found a movie about drug use.

spooks is enjoyable trash, featuring some well directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogue, and some third rate acting.many have described this is a uk version of "24", and one can see the similarities. the american version shares the weak silly plots, but the execution is so much slicker, sexier and i suspect, expensive.some people describe weak comedy as "gentle comedy". this is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre.give me smiley any day.

this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police. nonetheless, woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes.snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. the bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. that includes woody's girlfriend, played by rosie perez. there are no really clean, nice people in this movie. for that reason, i can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity

woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court. okay, that sounds all right there. it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story. but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film. this movie became redundant, retarded, and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by. woody harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, woody from cheers, and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. but after seeing his " acting performance " i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend. his acting was as dull and poor as the movie. another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez. i have liked movies with perez before, but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines ( do the right thing ). but now in white men can't jump she was made a central character with many lines, thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice. so after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i'm a white man and i'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building.

you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of "jeopardy!".the saddest thing about white men can't jump is that it had tremendous potential. for several years, i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. a film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men can't job left something to be desired.the movie's sequence of events is cyclical. first, billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball. he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. most stories build up to a climax of some kind, but the "climax" i saw was just another sequence in this repetition (this case being "billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball").in order for a plot to develop, some dilemma must be resolved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well. apparently the writers of white men can't jump forgot this rule, as the plot can be summarized as "billy needs to pay the bills." i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -- i'm sorry -- this was just plain awful. i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment.despite all this, white men can't jump is a successful film. apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them. others, i'm sure, were lured by the big names playing the leading roles. this leaves me to wonder, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have bothered watching this movie? i really don't think so.i'll give this movie two stars out of ten; the extra star is for the "jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. thanks, trebek.

i really can't understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star... how can you like such a retarded film, where all the animal abuse scenes are real? i don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments... jesus... what kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? i tell you, that director is either mentally retarded, or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone. or both. he truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.it contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock, especially to sensitive persons and children: a real frog is skinned alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water...this movie is more than awful; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another one, called ''cannibal holocaust'' or something like that. i'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster. no one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of truly great movies out there, in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, since it's the worst film ever -, so it wasn't successful. i hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised, and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films. i truly believe that everyone receives but what they give! there will be a day when all the retarded and cruel ''humans'' will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others.this, however, is probably my only ''negative'' review. i usually don't comment on a movie if i dislike it, but this time i just couldn't shut up. i had to speak the truth, because animal abuse must stop!

i'll say this much--this director is all about raw images...things most of us are not ready to confront head-on. images of sex, suicide, murder, and people "relieving themselves" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. although i don't think that i could ever see this movie again, i will say that the director does have a good eye. there were some really nice shots and "picture moments" in the film (the fans, the wire fish in their hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves "what the heck did we just see?").note: if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily...don't see this film.

is this the same kim ki duk who directed the poignant, life-spanning testimonial of "spring, summer, fall, winter and spring"? the same kim ki duk who directed the exquisite, nearly silent, heartbreaking longing of "3 iron"? the same kim ki duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of "the coast guard" and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all (characters and viewers alike) to experience redemption in "samaritan girl"? i just cannot seem to find him in this film.oh, sure, kim's nature motif is still present. the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters. yes, it's kim ki duk, all right. kim even describes the film as "beautiful" in an interview included in the dvd's special features. but i'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation.what is beautiful about angry, potty-mouthed prostitutes, lustful, violent and potty-mouthed fishermen, a covetous mute merchant, explicit animal torture, sequences of self-mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality? these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film. if it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater, this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material. it has been favorably compared to "audition" by japanese director takashi miike (much to kim's satisfaction), but aside from some astonishingly good performances, especially given what they had to work with, by lead actors seo jung and kim yoo suk, i find little reason to recommend this film. i have not seen "audition," but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of "the isle." its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic. its sex is not pornographic, but passionless and masochistic. characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot. its point is either non-existent or, i will admit, lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand.the only beauty is in the cinematography, which is classic kim: fog-shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake, mountainous terrain dominating the background, and an imaginative and playful use of color. at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim ki duk romper room. some touches, like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes, are intriguing. but as a film, this effort is downright confusing and, in the end, offensive to the senses, not necessarily to sensibilities. one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film-making in the trash heap of his past, for we know he is capable of so much more.

i generally don't give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. this film could be voted for as a good film. however, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting.first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. not movie violence, i am talking about real violence. this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. not that we all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). but the conclusion of the film ruins it all. *spoiler* our "heroine" finally dies, (by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me, now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon, nature growing over her, in particular her sex.. of course it is the director who "kills" the women heroine. women have to die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. that seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler*well, well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. but to use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be frightened of women, and men are cruel to women. thats just not enough. i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and whatever approach. but to me this film is just totally marred.

hey look, deal with it, there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this. although i think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story, which i have mentioned, blows.this was made in the mid-80's and is horrible in the music/score department. it's funny to see oprah as a latter-day crack-whore type.the scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator. pure classic cinema. first off, i don't care how drunk you are, you will react to 1200f degree flame (no matter how bad your acting). but they really milked that scene...it was comical. i'll tell you what though, i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death; she annoys me.

of all the movies i've seen, this one rates almost at the bottom (haunted mansion, nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom.) it is hasty, the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted. of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous, and illogical. oprah gives a palatable appearance as "bigger's" mom, but is not nearly at her potential. other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. so when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. the blind mother (yes) hears this, so bigger tries to silence her, but instead smothers her. now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom. if your desperate for a bad movie, this one could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are a lot better options. avoid this.

the premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. there is no emotion in this film. the first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. it was dull and boring.with some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.

ok ...i watch a lot of bad movies. i pride myself on that fact. many times there are some gems in the b rated bombs. but this movie is one of the worst i have watched. i like a good horror movie...but one with a plot of and sense of movement. the opening scenes seemed pretty good. decent music and imagery. then it goes down hill from there. one of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. they made that too much of a focus of the movie. so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been. no need to keep bringing it up. so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body. now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. well after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her. now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her. bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan. only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped. the idiot didn't even believe he killed her. so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun....somehow she manages to get herself strangled. so the last scenes of the movie are of the "spirits" of her and her twin walking out of the water. so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins. and not one but two innocent people die.good things about the movie: imagery bad things about the movie: music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors

i also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. first, i'm going to say that it looks great. cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer. i just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. i would not call this a horror movie. putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. there's no mystery, there's no suspense, you know who did it the entire time. it's a drama. you know what's going on with both sides the entire movie. the acting was okay, i guess, but nothing special.and the tagline, "revenge can be deadly"....really?...they should have check how many hundreds of horror/thriller movies have that exact same tagline?it pains me to say some of this, but i know a lot of the people who worked on this movie, and i know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass, so i give my honest opinion.

okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a $60,000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed? plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her? and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her "proof". i don't know i was not happy with the ending. this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad! do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy.

jenny neumann (from the sexploitation flick mistress of the apes, the american slasher hell night and others) is helen selleck, an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production. she's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. meanwhile, a black-gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass.***major spoiler***the killer is obviously helen (she speaks in her dead mother's voice, washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl!), but this has gratuitous heavy-breathing pov camera-work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise.the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about, having or trying to have sex, and, in one case, even blackmailing their way into getting laid. there's quite a bit of nudity and blood, but there's no sense of continuity, the photography is murky and the editing (by colin eggleston, who also scripted and produced) is terrible. the theater setting for a slasher film predates soavi's film of the same name and argento's opera (both of which are better than this one ) by five years though, and neumann is pretty hot.

this is a direct sequel to 'the mummy's hand' (1940), because the lead character, stephen banning (played by dick foran) is now thirty years older and is relating the story (with the help of archival footage) to his son's fiancé. there are only two unusual aspects to the film: the early death of banning, and the presence of turhan bey.lon chaney as the mummy kharis gets top billing, though given the nature of his role, he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about. there's nothing scary about his presence, except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé, isobel (elyse knox). dick foran gets second billing, but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes! we'd have to wait until 'psycho' (1960) when a lead character (janet leigh) dies way before the end of the movie! banning's buddy from the first film, babe jenson (now henson), shows up a little later looking much, much, older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original. it's hard to believe it's the same actor! unfortunately, this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by kharis after only two brief scenes. it's then left up to banning's son john (played by bit player john hubbard) to led the chase to the cemetery--no! the sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to banning's house to burn it down and kill the mummy. sound universally familiar? turhan bey is introduced to audiences as the new high priest, mehmet bey, to care for and feed tana leaves to kharis. with his 'exotic' voice and appearance, it's too bad he gets so easily killed. a better movie would have had 'babe' take von helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and mehmet bay. but instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous universal horror films, put together by the hack griffin jay who wrote many of universal's other clunkers, although he also did 'don winslow of the navy' (1942) as well as 'don winslow of the coast guard' (1943) which also featured elyse knox.elyse knox played anne howe in six joe palooka movies (1946-1949), and of course, turhan bey, with 43 movie and tv credits, is great in the title role of 'the amazing dr. x' (1948).the cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first 'kharis' mummy film, but there's little else of interest or excitement.i'll give it a 3.

the mummy's tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy's hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.while i absolutely loved "the mummy" with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep, and quite liked "the mummy's hand" with tom tyler as kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), i was not as taken with "the mummy's tomb".it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. lon chaney jr is okay as kharis, but doesn't really stand out. and i guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out. there's nothing really terrible here, but nothing really outstanding either, so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy's tale.

1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (dir - harold young): the 3rd universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer's perspective. the story is similar and the results are ho-hum. this time the story's location is the u.s. as the egyptian priest's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb. this time the mummy is played by lon chaney(which doesn't make much of a difference because he's really not asked to do much acting for this character). the new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice. again, a girl gets in the way, as the priest falls for one of the descendent's fiancé and wants her, yes--- to be immortal with him(haven't we heard this before?). the plan is, of course, thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches(similar to the frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story...how do they get a sequel?? i guess you'll find out with the next one in the series ?? or not.....

nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction. this is the case with "the mummy's tomb."the script is leftover ideas from older, better universal horror flicks like "dracula" and "frankenstein." the direction is trite and stale. the acting is mediocre. even chaney's kharis is feeble compared to tom tyler's in "the mummy's hand," and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabanne's vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film!universal realized how bad this movie was, and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as "the mummy's ghost" with a much better script and better director. the result was likely the best film in their four film "mummy" cycle, although not anywhere near as good as karl freund's 1932 original.cabanne's footage raises this film to a 3. the "new" stuff is a 2 at best. dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn't have to appear in dreck like this anymore!

cheap, mediocre sequel to the successful "the mummy's hand" has presumably dead evil professor andoheb(george zucco)preparing his predecessor mehemet bey(turhan bey)for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy kharis(lon chaney, jr who has no reason being in the disguise..any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims)in the goal of killing the surviving members of the banning family whose patriarch stephen(dick foran)and assistant babe hanson(wallace ford)retrieved the mummified corpse of princess ananka from her tomb in egypt..andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian custom. bey and the mummy kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the high priest of karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise. every full moon, bey will feed kharis a form of liquid derived of several tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes. bey commands kharis to kill stephen and his sister jane(mary gordon), while also biding time for babe to return so that he will become victim # 3. dr. john banning(john hubbard)plans to wed isobel(elyse knox), but doesn't know that bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with kharis' help. john's life is in danger because of his father..he's also the last remaining member of the banning line. if bey has isobel, there's no chance of any more bannings being born. the police must find kharis and the one responsible for his carnage..bey.this film is a continuation from hand set years later as members of that film, foran, ford & zucco all appear in "aging" make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the bannings. the cornball romance of john and isobel seems merely in this plot so that bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up. and, bey merely sees her frolicking with john on the grass..the whole "love-at-first-sight" rubbish really didn't wash for me. plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm..is any mummy really that powerful? this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it. there really isn't that much story here and yes, typical of universal monster pictures, even in america a mob of people will light..ho hum..torches going after kharis. you know how it'll end..john and the super-powerful kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame.

a resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge. a lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition. universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas. most of the budget was probably spent on lon chaney jr. to star as kharis, the mummy.other players are george zucco, wallace ford, turhan bey, dick foran and elyse knox.how much longer can this madness continue?

william s. hart (as jim treen), the most eligible bachelor in canyon city, is finally getting hitched, to pretty blonde waitress leona hutton (as molly stewart). his fiancée doesn't know it, but mr. hart is secretly the western town's "most wanted" bandit. however, hart is planning to go straight, due to his marriage plans. unfortunately, ms. hutton discovers hart's secret stash, whilst cleaning up his untidy cabin; so, she calls off the wedding. next, hutton succumbs to the charms of mining swindler frank borzage (as w. sloane carey).serviceable entertainment from superstar hart; he was ranked no less than #1 at the box office, by quigley publications, for the years 1915 and 1916 (ahead of mary pickford). the principles perform capably. later on, frank borzage was quite a director; and leona hutton, a suicide... **** a knight of the trails (8/20/15) william s. hart ~ william s. hart, leona hutton, frank borzage

this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died, idaho, colorado territories, and montana. it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man,' 'good man.' the script is horrible; there is very little direction, and lousy acting. dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife. mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade. in real life, jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent. he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking. when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city, montana. to insure that he could never terrorize them again, vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately. this is a horrible movie. i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will, even to this day.

back (again) in scotland, lassie is (again) on trial for her life. because the faithful dog sleeps on her master's grave, she must be put to death, according to law. oddly, it is also explained that lassie had no "legal" owner, which is, apparently, also against an old scottish law. if, after three days, no owner is located, dogs must be destroyed. edmund gwenn (as john traill) pleads lassie's case, which leads to an extended flashback, showing lassie's adoption by donald crisp (as john "jock" gray).although it's based on an interesting, original story ("greyfriars bobby"), "challenge to lassie" revisits several earlier lassie situations; and, it does not improve upon them. comparatively speaking, this one is sloppy and unexciting; and, it's a disappointing follow-up to "the sun comes up" (1949) *******. geraldine brooks (as susan brown) and several of the other performers may be charming, but can't elevate this one. little jimmy hawkins (from "it's a wonderful life") is among the notable children supporting lassie; much later, he will grow up to marry "dark shadows"' bewitching "angelique" (lara parker).

the perfectly stupid weapon. i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segal's movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. the plot is predictable, the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene.

get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick. speakman's considerable kempo skill (nice spin kicks, decent with the sticks - poor couch!) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting. the plot isn't half bad; just executed pretty poorly. but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts, you're missing the boat entirely. and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown, way way too few korean actors (even extras).

bad plot (though good for a b-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. but something has always bothered me about this film: how come mariska hargitay never speaks? in the tv version, she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman, even a kiss in a garden. yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. this bothers me because it not only takes out a female (though cliched) point-of-view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever speakman says.

first of all, yes, animals have emotions. if you didn't know that already, then i believe you are a moron. but let's assume that none of us are morons. we all know that animals have emotions, and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature, correct?what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are "human". the filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour, and when it happens they say, "that monkey is almost human!" (that's actually a direct quote).everything is in human terms. they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs "smile", but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages. but instead, researchers keep falling back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps "celebrating christmas", and this was enough to turn my stomach.but it doesn't end there. half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities. all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages. one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (though you have to be quick to notice it) where a captive monkey says in sign language, "want out. hurry go."obscure references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine. baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a "mother figure". and after 40 years of experiments, the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions.one chimp named "washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and to this day she remains thus. we get a brief glimpse (again through bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression. personally, i don't need to see any further experimental data. washoe, i apologize for our entire species.

i vaguely remember ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the '60s, i was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably ben, actress fay spain, and jody fair, who played angela in 1961's the young savages. ben was one of the people at a low-key sci-fi con in chicago, about 1970, when i had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. all these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. wish i still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (the cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! good to know ben's still alive & kicking! how 'bout a remake of creature, but 50 years older! ugly then, uglier now!

this movie deserves credit for its original approach. it combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling. unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp, moralistic, and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. as for the story itself, chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable, unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl.most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles. speaking as one of the latter, i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.

and it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject (with a little help from wagner).maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out, without the syberberg film to compare it to, which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. i actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film. all i know is, the german version is pure magic, while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes.the music... la musique... isn't even credited here on imdb... but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th-14th centuries" or something... well it isn't a great help to the film. it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher!!!rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive, too, and that doesn't help matters. syberberg's parsifal was adorable, and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented. .. .i shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like. i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater, the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty. but even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer, i'm afraid.points for earnestness, for chutzpah, but... this film simply needed beau-coup more bucks. it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks cheapo! bon marche!! oh and yeah, it just ends very arbitrarily with parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected... blah!

this movie is probably the worst i have seen. bad acting, bad script, bad everything. comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. both cyborg (van damme, 1989) and nemesis (olivier gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's albert pyun who has directed these two as well!the story is not original. the world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances. a special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story... the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there "prophecy" and the humans need someone to stop them. one girl together with a robot (kris kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.in this movie the director tries some hong-kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far. the movie fails miserably in this attempt.i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new "worst ever" movie to relate to. and to fans of the genre i recommend "cyborg" since i think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor. and if you can't stand van damme then check out "nemesis".i rated this movie 1/10.

still a sucker for pyun's esthetic sense, i liked this movie, though the "unfinished" ending was a let-down. as usual, pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy long's fights are extremely impressive. beautifully photographed, this has the feel it was done for the big screen.

knights was just a beginning of a series, a pilot, one might say. the plot (i really shouldn't call it that, there wasn't any plot) wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes, like [warning, i'm summarizing the plot]:in the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs (the bad guys) but after the climax, nea found out that there were many many more left of them. and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month's training, nea could kill them with a single blow.the movie was just pure kicking. i wasn't surprised at all, when i found out that the leading star was a kick boxer.there was one positive thing in the whole movie: it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends. i recommend watching it, if you are in need of laughter.

this move is about as bad as they come. i was, however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery. there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the us. it is also, starting with john ford, one of the most filmed. in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point.

once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be, and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap. there is absolutely no talent included in this film - from a crappy script, to a crappy story to crappy acting. amazing...

vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android (kris kristofferson) and a warrior woman (kathly long) as they face off against lance henriksen and gary daniels (who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie, the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets. no, don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg. strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren, however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it. however despite the disastrous casting, kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie. he gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive kathy long. (and kristofferson is playing a robot) despite the miscasting, kristofferson provides the few moments of interest. lance henriksen is slumming and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is baffling failure. you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper. (this is a movie where a dismembered kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack) worst of all it ends in a what if sequel, thankfully this has yet to materialize although i still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event.* out of 4-(bad)

actually, this is a lie, shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie. i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago. didn't bug's life also do that? i think it was at disneyworld in that tree, so i'm saying before they go and use that as there logo. also, shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios. they should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for dvd. the movie was cute, at least the little flyes were. i liked iq. i agree with animaster, they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure. i recommend it to families and kids.

as long as there's been 3d technology, (1950's i think) there's been animation made for it. i remember specifically, a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it. i don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that donald worked at a circus, was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts. this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's. if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin. there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses. this claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong. on top of that, this just looks like a bad movie.

with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr. and that ilk, my son was bugging us to see it. between dvd and the theaters, i've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding (incredibles, shrek) to the really bad (wall-e, brother bear). but this was easily the worst movie i've ever seen, kids or no kids. it was a "when it this stupid thing going to end?" kind of experience? ok, it's aimed at toddlers (or it better be - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3), but i've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and slow-moving. then once you're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over, there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish. the 3-d effects... yeah, if you've never seen a viewmaster they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). even my son was bored by the end. both my wife and i looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. bad in every respect.

this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic american) to write a story of a moon trip. absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the 3d dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. save your time and money and watch bolt insteaddamn. not enough lines, yet i feel that sums it up... well, i agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. btw - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!

today, i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids (6 & 8 years old), payed 3 x 12 euros (about 45 us $ total) not to mention gas, popcorn & soda, was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was "forced" to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick "cold war like" propaganda movie, like none i have seen during the last 20 years... and this is supposed to be a movie for children... in heaven's name! ps 1: the average working greek makes no more than 850 euros a month (approxiamtely 1050 us $) ps 2 my kids liked it... but then again they are no more than babies >in greek: mora, morons > like the one who wrote the script & the others who made this "3d disgrace" happen.ps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a ....!

i, also having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past, consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seen.1) i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not "the bad guys". also, that mocking russian names like "poopchev" is inappropriate.2) the grandfather fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone. two other flies also needlessly use the word "crap" twice.3) the whole movie largely smacks of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above.in all it's just crude, badly animated, even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view.

"nat" (voiced by trevor gagnon), along with his brainiac friend "iq" (voiced by philip bolden) and the always hungry "scooter" (david gore) are kids with big dreams. they want to be the first flies in space. and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, the apollo 11, is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out.the first thing you notice is the animation of the film. i found it done very well done. the scenery had depth to it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes. i didn't see the movie in 3-d, as it was broadcast on hbo. however, i could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3-d effects except a fight between characters near the end. i also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters. to me, they didn't look like anything resembling a fly, especially in the coloring. the flies were an unusual blue-gray that was kind of distracting to me.the performances from the cast was not bad, but it wasn't good either. there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story. the writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh. i saw nothing for adults, like jokes that they'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning.history was not followed in this film. in fact, i think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction, and no flies were on apollo 11. i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though.if you are an adult, this is not for you. it was not made for the entire family. this is certainly just for kids. but, save this one for a rainy day.

this is not a good movie. too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. the 3d was ok, but not superb. i almost fell asleep in this movie.the story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it. the characters are lacking, i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. pixar this is not.i would have liked to see more special 3d effects. also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying "lord of the flies" pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting.

1st the good news. the 3-d is spectacularly well done, and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks. the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history, and even features one of the actual participants in that story: buzz aldrin.and now the meat of the matter: it's about flies, for krissakes! flies with big, googy human eyes, true, but flies nonetheless. remember when i likened the "underworld" movies to rats vs. cockroaches? that wasn't intended as praise, and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally. this one's got even less empathy going for it. baby maggots? ugh. in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink, this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as "space chimps", also about critters in space.go rent "apollo 13" and see a 9-rated movie about the real space program (rip).

when i saw this trailer on tv i was surprised. in may of 2008 i was at six flags in new jersey and this was showing at a 4-d attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move). i take it that the version i saw was a shortened version (15 min.) and also re-created to add the motion effects. it was a cute movie... but that was it. it was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a cgi spacewalk seemed a bit...well...trite. i was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. i will say, the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute. so all-in-all, i would say, if you want to bring the younger kids... go for it. but if you are wanting to take your older kids, take them to another movie... they will thank you.

while the 3-d animation (the highlight of the show) did it's job well, most other elements fell flat. it was as though the filmmakers thought "well, it's gonna be 3-d so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development." and the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse. the public is drawn to three dimensional characters (shrek, nemo's dad) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics. the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight.and the absolute kicker? buzz aldrin's appearance at the very end (after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half) comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters "contaminants" and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility.???!!!??? did you just wanna tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus don't exist while you're at it?

okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3d imax movie about some flies stowing away aboard the apollo 11 and going to the moon. so they did. someone, somewhere, was an idiot.i want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. as far as i can tell, the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. the graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills, like a good rocket launch always does (my popular mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3d was pretty effective. the cg wasn't pixar-quality, but it was generally good. the flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics, with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies, african-american flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises).the scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clichés (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil russians, a fat fly who only wants to eat, grade-two level gross-out humour). in a movie aimed for imax, they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the lunar module during landing burn? please.) they couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between houston and the astronauts, all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap.but we liked the maggots.so they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. uh, yay. 1.5/5.

it is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.at first i must tell you that i love animated movies. unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. this cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:1) i quoted the tag line. it suggests that this movie has great 3d effects. well, i did not see any, at least not something special i never saw before.2) the "flies" in this movie look nothing like real flies. at least they could've make them black. but cyan flies, seriously? with giant heads and slim torsos?3) the story. i guess it was written for 6 year old kids. i could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.4) excessive patriotism. for example: "they are american files after all!" oh, give me a break.

"fly me to the moon" has to be the worst animated film i've seen in a long time. that's saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now. the story is to be generous...trite. the voice acting is atrocious, too cute sounding. the humor is of the romper room variety. the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.it gets a 2 only because of it's ok 3-d visuals. some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we've seen much better in the past. i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes. while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.i will say this though, it had a pretty cool soundtrack. and for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either. bad movie.

this movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. almost every hour or every issue. so when we went to the kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. but oh boy, how sad this movie is! it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie. shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce 'big hollywood movies'. i am not a movie critic, but i think a good movie starts with a good script. and the script is a nightmare. like my subject line says, it is nothing, and then looped. you could just stare to the television as well, without really seeing anything. that was the feeling we've got when we saw shades. shades is a bad production!!!

the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium, are fine: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the cool has been-director (mickey rourke), the bad tempered star, etc. you have seen everything before, but it's well done. but then! the rest of the time the film just repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. no climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f**ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. altogether, that makes 12 good minutes.

this is a very sad movie. really. nothing happens in this movie. the script is bad!!! i guess they've just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. the producers must have thought let's create a hollywood movie here in belgium. they didn't succeed. now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at 22h45 or something. in the past we have had really good movies in belgium, like daens. shades is a waste of your time. maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie. if you've seen 10 minutes of shades, you've seen it all. it was advertised to death on local radio and tv. i hope it will disappear in the shades soon.

the first (and only) time i saw "shades" was during a sneakpreview. it hadn't even been in premiere. i remember there was someone of the directors staff there, don't even remember who. it was a belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest. he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising. he's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled "shades".as soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing there is. nothing against the occasional swear word. however this was way beyond annoying. whenever rourke uses the f*** word to express something, it comes naturally. however, when someone from the cast, a non-english speaker uses the f**** or s*** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive.we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words. everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre. and we had to give a vote, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.

greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists, add some commentary by a bunch of uber-right reactionaries, ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem, and presents this as the theology of islam. maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church, adding commentary by some militant atheist "scholars, and call their film "what the world needs to know about christianity." ultimately, this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism. don't waste your time and money; just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.

this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one. and i'm jewish.anbody go to journalism school? read an editorial? freshman year rhetoric? these alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, might prove persuasive. but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, nor viable (or any at all) solutions, few sources and each of dubious origin, makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe.and thank goodness for that -- i wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap.a good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it.

that's pretty ridiculous, i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u.s, u.k, and all over the world. the religion has over a billion followers. i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society. i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan..i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media...i wonder why... also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion. its a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent, i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk, ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge, personal, or business matters through their so called religion

this video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate americans about islam. it's a pity that the people who did it really believe that american people is so dumb to believe in it, perhaps, as an american citizen, every person must protest against this kind of crap. if you want to know the truth about islam, don't let nobody tell you... the quran is public! you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it's true or false...the video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related. the music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see, even if they don't really understand what's going on in there. they use images that are misplaced from their original content.to end the comment i would like to make a reflexion... don't you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world?

the "documentary", and we use that term loosely apparently, summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world. then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face! also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them. what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets. if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle-east i would look elsewhere. try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources.

i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of moviesuntil now. this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say. i am not a muslim, nor am i an islamic studies expert, but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses. the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary. most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation. this is certainly the case with islam: what the west needs to know. yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are muslim, but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more.for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that may help. there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary.the documentary focuses on the middle east, but more muslims live outside of that region. more muslims live in china, believe it or not, than in saudi arabia. about 40% of all muslims live in pakistan, bangladesh, india and indonesia.the translation of the qur'an used in the documentary is a questionable one. i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking. i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why. surrah 98:6 is a good example. the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell. but the translation i have reads instead: "those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire." the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways. the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam, but this is not true. although it is true that much comes from the qur'an and hadith, islam also recognizes a concept called 'urf or "normative behavior." obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways, but 'urf is meant to be "good" behavior, what an average person would consider right or wrong.the documentary presents shar'ia (islamic law) as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow. this is simply not true. there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law. the hadith tradition is similar. there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others. using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and applicable, is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say which is what the documentary did.what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not islam or any other religion. christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on. i know this is not the same as suicide bombing, just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem. if you feel you have the answer, then everyone else must be wrong. but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people's views about politics, religion, god, or whatever.

it is not obvious from viewing this film (so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non-muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. there is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don't swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own.one specific, for instance, is researching the person walid shoebat; who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem. there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. i am not nor have i ever been a muslim. i have never read the koran. i am not a christian, nor a member of _any_ faith. but i am an intelligent and discerning human. while the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam; i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists. just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians, so, too, there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims.when you watch this film, you need to have the salt shaker on hand. one grain will not be enough, you'll need more. please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented, and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together, indicating a definite bias. be your own brain.

i couldn't relate to this film. it failed to engage me either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving. i couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it.i've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology. i'll admit that, as an atheist, i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism, but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs.

you talking' to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who i have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor. he has a heavy jones for taxi driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big. when he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! he goes from good fella to a surf's up dude over night. his friend can't believe the change (but he scores with faith ford and get's a cool paying gig). can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big?this is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. an interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution. who knows, maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time.don't waste your time with this movie. unless you want to see a hot faith ford and a young bubba from forest gump.xx

despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy, the inconsistencies of its main character, bronson green, aspiring new york actor easily turned l.a. phony, makes it hard to take the story seriously. green, who is constantly rejected by los angeles casting agents for being obsolete (i.e. too new york when the 80s is looking for big, blonde, and dumb), he finds success comes easily when he's willing to succumb to falsifying his image. unfortunately, the new hair dye and pacified "surfer" attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the jericho church, which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the aryan nation. green is willing to easily forget his past, and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years, in order to be the church's new spokesman. this makes no sense, seeing as how principled our character initially is. it is this sudden, and loose change in character, coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened, deniro-obsessed (as his taxi driver character) form who is able to battle the villains. a noble attempt on the filmmakers, but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious.the other characters, too, are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily -- the psychotic paranoia of the church leader, the self-interested actress girlfriend (the first girlfriend bronson has when he's in l.a.), and the new blonde girlfriend who's character lacks so much development, she is, for the most part, just a walking, talking void. we are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters. but there is really little development of any of them.the other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action. much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters, obviously, and later we see bronson's difficulties with breaking into the l.a. acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection. but after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted, there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens.for films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism, this was not one done with enough credibility.

ok. for starters, taxi driver is amazing. this, this is not taxi driver or amazing. what it is is bad. but i thought it was bad funny, which means that it did have some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue...wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the movie was preachy. there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder. i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yeah, it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to.

the dudes at mst3k should see this dog of a film. it's basically about a dopey hack actor in hollywood who can't land any acting gigs. and he has this strange obsession with the movie taxi driver. so what does this dumb actor do? he dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a l.a. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles. you'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes. like when the actor dude's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, "how could you do this to me?" and why is she crying? cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. this movie makes no sense at all! the actor who played the governor on benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog. this movie will crack you up, trust me. you talking' to me?!

no doubt, when madonna and guy ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. if you've been through the ordeal of watching "swept away," then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. after nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or "octress" as she might have pronounced it in "the next best thing"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. and that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. if there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.

and forget this. completely. if you really need to see madonna act, rent "body of evidence", at least willem defoe is in that one.in this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. you won't miss anything. bruce greenwood is wasted, jeanne tripplehorn is a prop, and madonna is so awful, it becomes amusing. why they had to butcher the original film into this mess, i will never know; guess they thought it was "bankable". madonna, as an actress, certainly is not.if you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.

for years madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act. unfortunately, trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well.she seems to fare better when she's not the star of any movie: if you watch her in supporting performances in desperately seeking susan (1985) or a league of their own (1992), she actually comes off looking good. since the story revolves on other actors, the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default.the trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie, regardless the genre. being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way, whether it be good, mediocre or plain awful, she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance. this is the crucial difference between madonna and, let's say, bette davis, or meryl streep. the latter two, even if the movie were to fail (because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it, or because the script fell short, or because the actress per se was just not at her moment), there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb. both davis and streep have had their share: bette, having a longer career than streep, in such fare as bunny o'hare (1971) and wicked stepmother (1989); streep in she-devil (1989). but at least there's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance.madonna, on the other hand, not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself, fares much worse, and even in the hands of someone as woody allen in shadows and fog (1992), an inferior classic, she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff, maybe even nervous, as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go.so here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two-character movie. guy ritchie, more known for action movies filled in masculine energy, seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of michaelangelo antonioni or ingmar bergman, who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease. and at 89 minutes, the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn, it doesn't feel sincere. from being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love, this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since fay dunaway's laura suddenly discovered her passion for tommy lee jones in the eyes of laura mars (1978). equally unconvincing is adriano giannini's nasty turn around the middle of the movie -- it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic -- and when he gives in to madonna's love, it's too quick to be believed. filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this "transformation" from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other.trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well -- it only makes it drag, bog it down, and when madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close-up, it feels she's trying too hard. many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little. hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion.could the movie have been better? of course. there are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again -- it's been done before, in overboard (1987), for example. it could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change (to ensure a moral tone). much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more "silent" film look -- as in persona (1966). it could have even been something of a thriller, providing that the giannini character have a mean streak as billy zane had in dead calm (1989). even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for madonna as the over the top, uber-control freak getting her comeuppance. but with its mean streaked humor, without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom, and without really defining giannini's own character, this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes.

i really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkindto it (to say the least)... but it was terrible. really terrible. badlyacted, a witless script, cack handed direction... watching this film waslike watching a car crash- you want to look away but you keep staringbecause you want to see how messy it's going to get. well, the car iswrecked and there are no survivors. on the plus side, the cinematographywas nice, made me want to go on holiday, if only to cleanse myself fromthis unholy

i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre (an art-house theatre, no less!) but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played, but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and...well...i wasn't disappointed, that's for sure! madonna has done it again: yet another bomb! when will this woman learn? when will the studios learn? (or perhaps they already have, since this film was largely dumped, with little fanfare and deadly word-of-mouth.) one would hope that being directed by her talented husband, who's created some interesting and/or terribly entertaining work, would bring out the same quality madonna showed in "desperately seeking susan"; alas, it just isn't meant to be, for here she is, at her very worst: singularly convinced of her own greatness, the smugness permeating every frame she's in, made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux-british accent, an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman, and look at her films of, say, the past decade: like a latter-day bette davis, there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body, which here, despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film (perhaps its only saving grace), are done no favors. to her credit, the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. no one involved escapes unharmed: bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on-screen, though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good, which had me thinking all the while, "denial ain't just a river in egypt!" adriano giannini, son of giancarlo giannini, star of the italian original, "swept away...", is, like his father before him, immensely attractive, and isn't altogether bad (despite winning a razzie nomination for "worst actor"), but, like almost everything else about this production, it all comes back to madonna, on whose shoulders rest the blame. why her? why not her husband, director guy ritchie? just who do you think was behind this remake? what actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her, with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? oh sure, ritchie deserves some blame: surely he - or someone - anyone! - should have, and could have, taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings (for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters), or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. above and beyond anything else, this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. a film like this, an "odd couple"-ish, war of the classes, should be light and fun, with leads who can bounce off one another with witty, even romantic, dialogue, for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded, really be? honestly, i don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for; it succeeds neither as comedy (i defy you to laugh even once) or romance (madonna's ice-princess routine precludes any chemistry). it's not even bad enough for us bad-movie lovers to enjoy. a real shame...

this is a review of 'freddy mercury the untold story,' theatrical release, chicago int. film festival, 2007 one of the phoniest, uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries i have seen. if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv, i would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. even as a made-for-tv documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial. the only redeeming aspects of this "the untold story of freddy mercury" -- or, uhm, was it "the untold story of princess diana" are the original concert, video and tv footage -- unabridged freddy mercury and queen. testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights, such as: "he was a free spirit," (really.. i thought freddy mercury was a company man...) belittle those freddy testimonials, by brian may or montserrat caballe that shed new and affectionate light into mercury's complex life and character. and... what up with the harry potter-like boarding school segments? how did the interview with the first girl-crush ("...who now works in a travel agency") and members of freddy's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury? vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, queen, the band remain unexplored. these filmmakers don't ask a single, provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject, instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a sunday night.

kojak meets the mafia. telly savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable. i never thought that his show was all that great. this is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with very predictable results. if you take the car chases and the general rambling out, there isn't much plot development or action. i find mafia movies to be dull because i have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. hollywood, and in this case, the italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. i saw the film and in a few days i won't remember much about it. lots of shooting, innocent bystanders dying, betrayal, and that sick loyalty. the film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent. but the dubbing is so bad (due to voices that just couldn't come out of those bodies), that i almost started looking for godzilla approaching the bay.

crime boss is directed by alberto de martino; an italian crime drama partially filmed in hamburg, germany. an easily forgotten movie. even in spite of a good car chase sequence, this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly. a new don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake. brutality and violence breed the same in return. this can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. just the look of the film brings back memories of american drive-in fare. even the popular american actor telly savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama. antonio sabato also stars with:paola tedesco, guido lollobrigida, serio tramonti and piero morgia.

as if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already, we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori (1973) which i had watched earlier this year. the marquee-value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind, rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters! apart from not looking minimally sicilian, he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. antonio sabato, then, makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with savalas, which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter's spirited teenage niece)! besides, for a gangster flick, there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore, the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else. incidentally, the bargain-basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the film's title - is ever listed!

having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive. the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising. alive did not deliver. very slow development. loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals. the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up. could have done so much more at the end. most of the movie is just " sitting around ". to put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end. it really needed more shock elements. if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment.

i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me. i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable. alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. however, these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive. the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film. unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. the action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about ok. the earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherency. there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. but the full length film is dull. only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fans.

i've seen most of ryuhei kitamura's work and i've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action. scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts, gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage. with "versus" and "aragami" kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget. so what happened in "alive" ? to be more blunt, the answer would be - nothing. nothing happened in "alive" it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi "alive" is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro (played by hideo sasaki) a death row convict who survives his execution. he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments. he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it's host's humanity grants supernatural powers. naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro, the bad thing is that doesn't happen very soon. similar to "aragami", "alive" sets it's first half in establishing the basic exposition. characters are introduced, their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered. the whole thing even takes place in just one set. the first major problem of that comparison is that while "aragami" was just a 70 minute movie, "alive" drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long. that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case. dialogue is dry, monotonous, delivered without any sense of emotion or depth, characters themselves aren't much interesting. there were some small attempts at making "alive" a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic : evil government people against, super-powered protagonist, whom yes you guessed it, saves the girl in the end. like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set, and after two hours that does get boring, even worse the set design itself wasn't even interesting to begin with, and doesn't do much to improve on other aspects of the film.now, after that first part is over, one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning. sadly that is not the case. the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies, complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers. they're just not interesting or fun, kitamura's creativity from "versus" is gone, the small set even limits his often very impressive camera-work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights, a shame really.evidently "aragami" was better on all accounts and "kitamura" had learned something from "alive". so it wasn't at least a total loss watching this movie. if only to understand the errors made, how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie.

as interesting as a sheet of cardboard, this dispensable period piece has little going for it. it's overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real-life characters must have felt as they dodged the french revolution's fickle hand of justice. eric rohmer at 82? it shows.

when samantha eggar (as phyllis dietrickson) answers the door of her house swathed in a towel, you realize that as competent an actress as eggar may be, she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of barbara stanwyck. and it is not entirely eggar's fault. in the original film, wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a towel, but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house. and she doesn't "come out"; she appears, almost as if by magic. walter neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor. there is a reason for this. stanwyck is much higher than neff (fred macmurray) when they are first introduced. it is not just the towel. the towel adds to the seductive allure. her pose is like a greek goddess overlooking her domain, and, in a strange way, you feel as if, from the start, she is actually controlling the entire situation. she has sexual, even magic, power. this person is no ordinary housewife. this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within.back to 1973. the remake has crenna knock on the front door. stanwyck's stand-in, eggar, answers the door with a towel around her. there is no "appearance". she simply opens the door. the alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973. she opens the door with a towel around her. it may be sexy in a charlie's angels sort of way, but it's not nearly as mysterious. the filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand wilder's point. the script may have said "phyllis appears in towel" so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel. the point is not the towel. the point is the enigmatic quality of phyllis, and the potential power she wields. wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique. the filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that's what wilder did. and in the choice of shot, lost all of phyllis' mystique.richard crenna also seems miscast. he seems like he's "acting" and not really in the midst of the dilemma. part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70's actor. he can't get into the 1940's. when macmurray first speaks into the microphone, sweat begins to drip from his face. no sweat on crenna. and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning. in the original, neff says, "i didn't get the money, and i didn't get the woman." in the 1973 version, crenna says, "i didn't get the money, and i didn't want the woman." did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story? or were they dumbing it down for a "television" audience?this made-for-tv movie is a by-the-numbers rendition. all the sharp edge of the original is lost. the only stand-out, maybe, is lee j. cobb in the role made famous by edward g. robinson. but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original. this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tv-movie made probably by the same people who did "gilligan's island". they might as well have tried to remake "citizen kane" or "gone with the wind". if mediocrity is the best one can hope for, what's the point? the 1944 classic is a film with a capital "f". this made-for-tv remake deserves an "f" grade, or, maybe a "d" for dumb.

this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film, "double indemnity," is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script. this grade-b tv fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general. while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black-and-white films and sought disclaimers on wide-screen movies that are shown in pan-and-scan versions, the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake.the first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script. the billy-wilder-raymond-chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time-slot with room for commercials. then update the production with bland, color photography, smart, upscale sets, and tv-familiar actors. thus, the brand-new "double indemnity" eliminates the atmospheric black-and-white film-noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original. gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost. gone are the close bond between keyes and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis.the look of jack smight's take on "double indemnity" is more "dynasty" than film noir. phyllis dietrickson has a designer home to die for, and neff's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman's salary, not to mention the sporty mercedes convertible that he drives. neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $200,000. if not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust? not in this version. richard crenna shows little interest in samantha eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister. crenna fails to capture the cynicism of neff, and his attempts at double-entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat. eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind. only lee j. cobb manages a creditable performance as keyes. director jack smight and his three principals have all done much better work.there was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule. there was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double-disc package. the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting, lackluster direction, and tv grade production values. the 1973 "double indemnity" should be titled "10% indemnity," because viewing it only underscores the 100% perfection of the original movie.

bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for $2. i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one.the movie is quite cliche "1970's" and is quite groovy for that. unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie. in fact, i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was.the movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait.......for them.if you are into b movies, this might just be for you, just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens, and did i mention not much story line either...

i noticed with some amusement that in the end credits, the detroit pd is thanked for their participation. the chief of police even has one speaking line playing himself (and boy, can you tell he can't act). the reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. not the kind of pr, i would think a police force would want. other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the '70's with a racial angle. alex rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. he makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. hari rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. the movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?). not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was. seeing that director arthur marks was also behind the braindead "friday foster" and "bucktown", i shouldn't have wondered.

you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? well i had a similar sensation while watching this film. okay, i did actually choose to go and see aprile, and i knew about nanni moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps. caro diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. in aprile, however, moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something i thought was reserved for losers like me. surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. by making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. and when he started fawning over his newborn baby, i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.

...however i am not one of them. caro diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self-indulgent mess. moretti says he feels a need to make this movie, but doesn't want to, whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it, but really doesn't want to either. a film about italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but this is not that film. at one point, moretti and his friends are standing outside the communist party headquarters, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside, but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them. interposed with moretti's political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant pietro (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument, but they never come. i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a nanni moretti movie again. he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.

before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team, he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies, many of which were parodies of major hollywood features. following a dispute with anderson, laurel continued the informal series of parodies at joe rock's smaller (and more indigent) production company.most of laurel's parody films were only mildly funny at the time, and even less funny for modern audiences who haven't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying. 'west of hot dog' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot-'em-ups. it's marginally a specific parody of 'west of the pecos', an oater released two years earlier with no major actors. since 'west of the pecos' was never a huge success, it's difficult to see why stan's film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery, much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it. and where did they get that title 'west of hot dog'? possibly it's down to the fact that 'hot dog!' was a sexual interjection favoured by american lechers in the 1920s. (as in the opening scene of the stage play 'machinal'.) 'west of hot dog' was produced and co-directed by joe rock. among his many other achievements, rock introduced laurel to lois neilson, and he was subsequently best man at their wedding. full disclosure: in the last years of his life, i had the great privilege of befriending joe rock and interviewing him. nearly ninety years old at the time, rock's memory was impressively clear ... but he remembered nothing at all about 'west of hot dog', and i can't blame him. this movie is eminently forgettable.the leading lady's character is named little mustard: if that's meant to be a parody of something in 'west of the pecos', i don't get it. there are a couple of 'impossible' gags here, including laurel's method for mounting a horse. for just one moment in this movie, stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run. 'west of hot dog' is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keaton's short comedy 'the frozen north', but keaton's version is much funnier. the plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in keaton's feature 'our hospitality' but (again) suffers by comparison: here, two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the last chance saloon, but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot stan. however, the brothers will become the legal heirs if stan dies. hmmm...seriously, though: is such a bequest legal? as soon as stan takes possession of the property, surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision, not the previous owner's decision. i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy.at one point, a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock. it looks cheap and isn't funny.this 'hot dog' is no weiner, and no winner: it's just a whiner. my rating: one point out of 10. hang on, stan: in a few more years you'll be one-half of a comedy legend.

back in the day, i remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that had the same artwork as this show... and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me! i was not estatic, but curious... i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck. my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy (i'm actually gay), so i decided to watch the show with low expectations.what a horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! first off, i hate the new characters. tiff and tuff are so dumb and i hate how so many fanboys drool over tiff, it's sad. i also hate how they made chef kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. bad move, 4kids tv! escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to the king dedede (who sucks big time in this show) and i hate the face of that one company that keeps supplying dedede with those awful weapons to destroy kirby. so stupid, i hate this show.i then began to hate kirby even more since it was obvious nintendo was just aching to get kirby some popularity. kirby'll never beat mario in the fight for coolness, and kirby will always be nothing but a tiny little cream puff of gayness. nuf said!!!

this insipid mini operetta featuring a eddy-mcdonald prototype in a valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. it's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. in under a minute he is packed off to morrocco where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.this two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers. with more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation.

getting lost in space frozen for 15 years, that's unlikely. falling into a star... improbable. falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes... ludicrous. getting rescued by a ship just then... priceless.no, it's not zaphod beeblebrox's heart of gold to the rescue. it's also not the parent of the year awardees. after sentencing her daughter to two years' solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they've picked up. this foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat, which makes up most of the film's action. combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away, who obligingly simpers in the line of fire.in the end, the family of three abandons the metropolis-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave, instead using the psycho's fighter ship which they've refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0.7-kiloton missile. you have to love those hard sci-fi statistics! as long as hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they'll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the sci fi channel.

a pretty average scifi film. the plot was more or less obvious from the start. although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliched, using ideas taken from numerous films.the basic plot: scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting. onboard they find a stasis pod, which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment. after 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up, you realise that he is a complete lunatic. something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship...after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims, overall i think speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter, which i didn't consider to be a good film either.not a good film, get aliens out and watch that again.

on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk. he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship. they dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star. this massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors. anyway, to cut a long story short, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies.the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying. 'annoying' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged, frightening, dangerous maybe but not 'annoying' but he is. the three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made craft could exist, never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task. despite the vast size of the spaceship, the crew all have appallingly kitted out, tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. but there are a lot of corridors.the film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci-fi thriller. but nothing great.

despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. the script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and john lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. his performance is one-note and irritating.the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn. his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.

i saw this on dvd ( it`s known as corrupt in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitel`s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in " this gritty and powerful police thriller " . what the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo ? well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the cd player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film ? the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . it`s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( i don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy dvd or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is ennio morricone`s score . it`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns.all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . it`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards

encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film. bad mistake. i've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film. the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. one for keitel obsessives only.

i thought harvey keitel, a young, fresh from the sex pistols john lydon, then as a bonus, the music by ennio morricone. i expected an old-school, edgy, italian cop thriller that was made in america. istead, i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: wtf!!! too many unanswered questions, and not enough action. the result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet. keitel and lydon work well together, so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script. oh, and the morricone score: ok, but not memorable.overall, not a waste of time, but not a "must see", unless you are a hardcore keitel fan.

tom brown's schooldays aspect ratio: 1.78:1sound format: stereoin late 19th century england, young tom brown (alex pettyfer) is sent to the public school at rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (stephen fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, flashman (joseph beattie).already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably gordon parry's superior 1951 version - thomas hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter ashley pharoah (tv's "where the heart is") and director david moore (the forsyte saga). it's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to hollywood and beyond. otherwise, this is typical uk tv fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. the uk publication 'radio times' described it as "daintily odd" and raised a querulous eyebrow over "all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys". quite.

this tear-teaser, written by steve martin himself, is so unbelievably bad, it makes you sick to your stomach!the plot is pathetic, the acting awful, and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending.avoid at all costs!

this film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, silas marner by george eliot.the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying "suggested by the book silas marner". suggested? it was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:a wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.in this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. in only one can i find a difference. silas marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far. on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! there is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. if i was a trustee of george eliot's i would insist on reparation. if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. at the very least it should be entitled silas marner - adapted by s martin. or better still removed from the archives!if you are interested in this story - and i hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch silas marner. or read the book! the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.

there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre. i was thinking about jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to steve martin.this movie is reasonably well acted and directed, but the script is a stinker. martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in "roxanne", but this effort to bring a victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility. if you want to see an old story updated with some style, best to rent "great expectations".

just got back from a free screening and i'm very glad i didn't pay to see this very sub-par film. the theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults. it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap-stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot!). the movie is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly annoying. the characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all.visually, the film is about average with nothing that really stands out. they did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from wallace and gromit, but other than that it's very forgettable imagery.although i was really bored throughout the whole film, i chuckled a couple times. it's not an absolute failure, but i most definitely would not want to watch it again. if you're a parent with kids (and you don't care that your kids see mindless cheap-jokes) then feel free to take them to see it, but everyone else shouldn't waste their money.

a few months ago, i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster (hey, kmadden) about this film. the poster insisted that if i gave 'flushed away' a chance, i would like it. based partially on that argument, i agreed to watch the film.'flushed away' has good intentions (at least on aardman's part), but lacks the strength to pull it all together. its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain, rita (played by kate winselt), who, imo, should have been the movie's main character instead of roddy (hugh jackman). rita's cool, tough, and interesting, while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling.one of the things that bothered me most about 'fa' is the repetition of jokes that aren't funny to begin with. when roddy gets hit in the crouch, the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately. "my name's shocky," says one of rita's brothers, who then electrocutes roddy at least three times. my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low.i won't waste time griping about katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar (one similar film's a coincidence, five's a rip off.), but i will say i'm disappointed in aardman. they can do (and have done) so much better. try harder next time, guys.

i wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute "borat" tonight, and left quite disappointed. i was a huge fan of wallace and gromit, and routinely go to see animated films. that being said, i found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out, but stayed waiting for this film to get better. never happened.the visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of kate winslet and ian mckellen (i had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was gandalf and magneto). the problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the add-set. it registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another, weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an "important message." it looks a lot like busted oscar bait for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring with critics, i wouldn't be surprised if the academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware. but if you're looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats, take my advice and wait for ratatouille.

ok maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! he ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. he will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.he plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! the cool part about this movie is the slugs. they do all the sound effects. they sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. ok bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. i didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like wallace and gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that. the movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry.

i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them. the film was simply awful - i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful. matthew modine's days as a leading man are way over. gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed. the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters. i highly doubt this will be picked up, but then again, people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes. i really think "kettle of fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie i've ever seen.

worst movie ever made!!! please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie.check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film. the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film. i find the positive comments very misleading. i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech. don't waste your hard earned money!!!!!! this film is retarded!! i can't believe a film like this would ever be made. why would hollywood waste their time on such junk? this film is an attempt at nothing. i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash. i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money. i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash. please don't make the same mistake! it really is the "worst movie ever made!"

i'm a fan of matthew modine, but this film--which i stumbled upon on cable--is absolutely witless. i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check her worst instincts. there are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. what a waste of all this acting talent. given how expensive it is to film in new york these days, i have to wonder how this got made in the first place. and if you're wondering why i watched it at all, it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer. it's not a very demanding picture!

well, you'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish, bland, and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like. set in tunis, mom piddles around the flat, gets antsy, and decides, albeit reluctantly (she just can't help herself), to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret. meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons. the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer. this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking (they walk everywhere) and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring, uneventful, low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits. go figure. (c-)

if you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. lilia is a widow. she has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out. she has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger. while checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret, where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. the film is very misogamist. it's portrayal of men is dismal. which is rather odd as lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for the hell of it. when she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. she does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. the other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. not short enough i say. she does find romance, however brief , with you guessed it....no surprises here we didn't see coming. though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way. maybe this film just isn't targeting my demographic- 30 male

just saw a pre-screening tonight. what can i say? it lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all. it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done, and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humorless movie play out.so let's see... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he's not good enough for her, check. we have the three buddies that all have their own "personality" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from disney), and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen... check. we have the girl's ex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side... check. we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. we have the movie's "funny" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down or being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos... check. and dare i call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie... check.honestly, this could have... no, wait... should have been a pg-13 movie. all that needed to be dropped were any f-bombs. honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r-rated comedies like superbad and knocked up. the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for. i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. let's put it this way... in the theater, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. when this movie hits showtime and you're checking it out at 2:00 pm on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eve's hotness (who is not quite a 10, but still very good looking).aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. so there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? it's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be "feel-good" with the abruptness.there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up/compose. i'll give them props for a great choice of sound.one last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion. i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. but i say hold onto your money. if this was pg-13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends, i'd say knock yourselves out. otherwise, definitely pass. it doesn't try and compete with the r-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely isn't as good.

this movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. this was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially molly's, totally unconvincing). what was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, i was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. the so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); i honestly found her friend patty (referred to as the hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. but then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to american pie and happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). i feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). done with tirade.

i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was. i am so glad i didn't pay to see this movie and that i didn't sit in a movie theater for this one. where to begin on this movie, the acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special. i thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time. i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. now, alice eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and jay. all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. the humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials. i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing. i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie. i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie. so save yourself the agony and just don't see it.

the characters at depth-less rip offs. you've seen all the characters in other movies, i promise. the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably. it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field, completely forced, and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked. the hot chick is old and has no personality, shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non-underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing. the attraction between molly (the hot chick) and kirk (the dorky love interest) is barely communicated. the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt- mishap kiss occurs. afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame. the main focus of this movie is not the relationship, but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super-bad-esquire movie with a semi appealing plot. i could compare this to the hangover, in its forced nature. i wont get into that. i could keep going but its just pointless. just don't pay to see this movie.

big bad ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials, and can be found at numerous brothels around melbourne any given night.terrible film by the way, wasn't shocking just bad, uninterestingthe main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown , and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in melbourne.i dunno who the women where? probably pros's that ralph knew?no story of interest, its one of those fast forward jobsplease look up big bad ralph at brothels around melbournehes famous in them.i wish i could give 0/10 but ill give it 1. only cos i cant give 0

first up this film, according to the slick said it won "best film" at "worldfest" film festival in houston, texas. hmmm must have been a quiet year.wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks, is pretty much just as terrible as other aussie b grader "body melt", but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on hi 8 video.my guess is the film makers, watched a lot of troma films, and really bad b grade gore films, thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film.don't get me wrong, i love really low grade films, just the fact that some of the characters put on fake american accents, almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. really disappointing ending as well, the showdown could have been way more exciting, and some good fight scenes. you can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy "bad taste" with the whole, car explosion, rocket launcher, and endless amount of people being gunned down, yet the finale lacks any over the top humour, or style like "bad taste".if you like watching really bad gore films, or are interested in no-budget film making, watch it, otherwise stay away.

i didnt think it was possible, but i have found film worse than 'body melt'. this film is really really bad! and what makes it worse is that its another australian film...shot on what looks like vhs, and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack, it just keep getting worse and worse, which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is (skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone?).and why do their accents keep changing? from bad new york drawl, to prissy english, then pure aussie! and it happens to the whole cast!this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (i believe it was the utah film festival). this has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything (perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell).come on guys! this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100!!! it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there.well done to the "film" makers of this trash, for proving there is a reason not to see films..... 0/10

at first glance, this movie has got everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a "not under 18" restriction, filled with hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop! but then, this movie is a succession of bad story (so thin), bad acting -with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad monty python -, bad music ('80s hard rock), the videotaping is awful, the ending is a real shame... plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous, the gore not very impressive. and those vampires reflect in a mirror, and don't even fear daylight! you get to be very disappointed, unless you see it as a "space mutiny" or "troll 2". i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100, because that's its real place.i'd say it can still be fun to watch, if you have friends and enough beer.3/10

i don't know if the problem i had with this movie is that i was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but i believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film. if you don't have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk.

this is the most depressing film i have ever seen. i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me. i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the crops were vital. yes, i get all that. what i find hard to take is i can't remember one single light moment in the entire film. maybe it was true to life, i don't know. i'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and i know that every film can't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion.i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film. i can't stress enough how this film affected me as a child. i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back. i think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the prozac.

gregory peck's acting was excellent, as one would expect, and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic "moment." but, the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch, for me anyway. i tried to like it, but had to fast-forward through the last thirty minutes or so. i feel i wasted a couple of good hours. had it not been for gregory peck, i wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.

the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message.spoiler: they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. they blame bears and deer for "misbehaving" by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger.

"ally mcbeal" was a decent enough show, but it was very overrated. the characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short.i think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome.

what the hell is this? "kooky drama"? "lawyers in loony tunes land"? the world's thinnest, most duck-faced actress (even more duck-faced and anorexic than michelle pfeiffer) overacts her bony butt off, making cretinous grimaces that would shame bugs bunny, in one of the most animated non-animated tv series ever. this is also the most annoying one-hour-format tv show ever, hence the worst.all the men act like pansies, and i for one refuse to believe that even hip big-city shysters are all as delta-male-like as this sorry (short) bunch. wuss peter macnicol manages to be even more irritating than calista flockofducks with his fake hollywood "shshshs" speech impediment: it's the sort of pseudo-inability to pronounce the letter "s" by turning it into a moronic "sh" that the likes of jon shtewart and christian shlater also practice with zeal. watching macnicol talk, i always wonder how come his jaw doesn't dislocate... human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the "sh" sound more than three times per second. he is a medical wonder.this badly conceived and written legal-drama/comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s pc. it has political correctness written with huge, neon letters. is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of lawyers being full of ideals, high principles, and moral fiber? laughable, but that's the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in hollywood since its inception. after all, what is more noble than defending a murderer, a rapist, or a thief? when a tv series as retarded as "ally mcbeak" starts preaching to america about how it should run the country, then it must be time for paris hilton to become president. "ally mcquack" is both a product of recent and large-scale western dumbing-down and a perpetrator of it.those supposed touches of "eccentricity", like the unbelievably annoying musical numbers, are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny. this is no monty python. whatever "new" the talent-free makers of this garbage were aiming for, they failed with honours. "ally mcbeak" is a highly commercialized tv venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies, bored housewives, and bipolar lawyers. it's yet another dull "objection overruled sustained your honour may i call the witness" legalistic baloney that the american audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason...

mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good? maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. take a bite. mmmmmmm. take another bite. another. another. eat. eat it, you!!! keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea. you have just had the ally mcbeal experience.i stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked. like that stack of pancakes, i gorged myself on it. but the enjoyment soon wore off, because the ally mcbeal character (whom we see to be cute & endearing at first sight) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure, whining complainer you've ever met. (call me a feminist, but i prefer my female leads to have a spine.) the gags & gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed, the music of vonda shepherd (which is really shoved in your face) becomes grating, and the incessant character changes & rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera.my advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome (and it will). i made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured. it was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome.and next time you go to ihop, skip the pancakes. order something healthy like the fruit cup. it'll sit with you much better.

i think this is almost all i need to say. i feel obliged to explain my actions though. i've basically never seen such an armateur production, and i mean that in all senses of the word. although the physical camera work, boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas.unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has an awful script, awful acting and worst of all, awful annoying characters.it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets, distribution like haiku tunnel, there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at sony, but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution. i'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up.the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title. however, the reason for that is even a let down. i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it. i've seen a lot of films in my time, and i'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but this was too much. i'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema. shame it's such a low point.

really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just not funny. josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny, and yet he thinks he's hilarious. the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first, until josh's "look at me, i'm wacky" approach began infesting each and every scene. the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to, and that is saying quite a bit, since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie. and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies' "debaser," i have just one thing to say: what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this? what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a terrible movie?

my wife and i rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "office space". blockbuster and imdb even had it as an "also recommended" selection if you liked "office space".now, i've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times. i love it. it's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people i've worked with over the years. "haiku tunnel" is similar to "office space" in that they are both films. that's where the similarity ends. we sat through probably the first 50 minutes of ht, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. it didn't. we couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape. thank god it was a free rental. i'd have been p***ed if we'd actually paid for it. we should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. i doubt it.haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced. the movie is so unfunny it's painful. just mail the friggin letters already!!! the premise is asinine. the jokes are awful. we got as far as the "printer doesn't work" scene and had to stop. we couldn't take it anymore. this film is an embarrasment for josh kornbluth.if you are a fan of office space......don't waste your time with this turd. 0/10

office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and `temps,' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as `clockwatchers' and `office space,' and very successfully. this latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, `haiku tunnel,' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in. unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.	as the narrator/star of the film, josh kornbluth (playing josh kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of `san franc'l'isco.' it's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny. it is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.	kornbluth plays kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp.' it's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. but when he goes to work for a lawyer, bob shelby (warren keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore (helen shumaker) to kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm.' the thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position. he's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that `something easy to do' in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him). these are `important' letters, however, and by the end of the week, kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk. and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it, kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over. and quick.	the brothers kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy, where it says `if you play it straight, they will laugh.' but, they didn't, and the audience won't. because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) `plays' funny-- as in, he `knows' he's being funny-- he never is. and that's exactly what kornbluth does here; so rather than being `funny,' he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie. 	in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons: the directing, which-- if not necessarily `bad'-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of josh kornbluth. quite simply, kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. unlike stiller, or even steve martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character. and being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film. rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.	the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous. the effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project. 	shumaker and sarah overman (julie faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily. but it's still not enough to save the day or the film.	the supporting cast includes amy resnick (mindy), brian thorstenson (clifford), june lomena (davonne), joe bellan (jimmy the mail clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer, as the orientation leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, `what was he thinking when he agreed to this?' in any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right. `haiku tunnel,' however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as: `obscurity.' i rate this one 1/10.  

this movie is nothing like "office space" except in the premise. office space was hilarious. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, as i laughed not once during the entire film. mr. cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 jason alexanders in the same room. if you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary.

i get it the diehl character is s'posed to be a microcosm of america itself - seeing arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good-will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops. sorry wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialog and plotting. better luck on your next flick. another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of hunger, these people don't get enough to eat. truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. they need self-respect, self-worth, dignity which you can't give a man. yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. less the center for hunger in america, i would say it's more the center for alcoholism, drug-abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band-aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age-old human problem of homelessness. bill diehl was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.

this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies. two harbors is a b&w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. as a matter of fact, i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (not that two harbors is completely without merit, but i'll get to that a little later). as is common with independent films, two harbors is limited in terms of location. there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middle-aged main character, vic, played by alex cole. writer/director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic, who is one of the dealers there. he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them "outer space action figures") and he is a caustic asshole. this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors - all the chatting. i've said it before and i'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. there are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota. this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.the other problem with two harbors is the acting. i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. there are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in minnesota. many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naïve. in narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances. if you don't believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.originally, i thought vculek was using non-actors, but as the film went on, i decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera. it's that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). granted, the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e. johnson as cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic's extra-terrestrial hunt. they seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within. ms. johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?) labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here's what i mean. without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. after that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it's like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle, detailed (cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic. then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it's based on a true story, which got me to thinking. with all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write, two harbors might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act. if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, reel 13 or whomever. there might be something to this story after all(for more information on this or any other reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)

i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time: darklight.the gist of the film- lilith was adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself adam's equal and refused to submit to him. see, i took those words straight from the script. then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! she ends the film under the control of the faith- an all male group!other than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful. apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about darklight.

what is interesting is that the acting; was not bad, just not enough. it was rather lame., special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure. standing alone they weren't horribly bad, but put together was a tragic move. the show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along, but it failed totally.much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects.don't believe it, they were kinda cool. appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton. an experienced actress would have brought something to the part, like appleby never did. scfi puts out some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this failed so drastically.

i sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, yet keeping an attentive eye. i waited for the next awful special effect, or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force, so i could learn how not to make a movie.it seems when they set out to make this movie, the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made, and saw cool things and said: "hey, we can do that." for example, the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking, is the one car the protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on to. the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it. the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie. but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility, and lack of reason for so many elements! for example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways, happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip. nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck, you know they are already dead. then the guy protecting the vip says "under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies, he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion. then for no apparent reason, defying logic, convention, and common sense, the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck!!! a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense. transparent acting distanced me from the movie, as well as bad camera-work, and things that just make you go: "wow, that's incredibly cheesy." shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1, because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.

while it does crack the odd good joke, the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes.unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best rte have ever made, its really dry and sarcastic. sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud. people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good. overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre. its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff. i find benny hill funnier.

absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time! it starts off badly and just deteriorates. katherine heigl is woefully miscast in a lolita role and leo grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. the only cast-member with any enthusiasm is tom sizemore, who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. the script is dire, the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! it is also the most sexist movie i have ever seen! katherine heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. she's seen as an evil, wanton seductress who lures the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. it is implied throughout the movie that she's underage, and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief! at the end, she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously (ha!) become demented with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere. horrible. don't waste your time.

the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute. other than that, this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it. jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual, but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly. the plot makes no sense, the dialogue is dumb, and there are numerous smaller faults. but the dog is cute...

i rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version i saw as a kid. it was not. i was therefore very disappointed with what i felt was marginal acting, poor character development, and most of all, failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. in this version... the "dog of flanders" is just a cute "aside" to the movie. get the 1959 version!

people love the original story for its ending. the hollywood style ending made this 99 version of 'a dog of flanders' just for kids movie. i didn't cry this time because the story was too hollywood. japanese tv series are much better.

"the running jumping & standing still film" is not a film as such, but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme. this 'film' got richard lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first beatles film: 'a hard day's night".richard lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959. this film was entitled the running, jumping, & standing still film. it was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production. since the film was intended to be viewed by lester and his partners alone, a small amount of money and time was invested. the sole purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera. the film cost 70£ to make, and it was filmed in sepia-toned film stock in a field on a couple of sundays. all of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production; the finished production is eleven minutes in length.the running, jumping, & standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time. all of the events in this film take place in a field. a few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer developing film in a pond, an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model's face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun. not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away, but it also pokes fun at english culture when compared to american culture. another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, which has been constructed out of the flag of the united kingdom. one of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it, and the kite breaks. according to neil sinyard, author of the films of richard lester, this event symbolizes the united kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the united states during the space age. according to this scene, the british fly primitive kites while the americans, the world-power after world war ii, fly highly-advanced rockets and space shuttles.

an interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery to this movie then the first. even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer. there are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up. all up the movie is enjoyable. the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film, norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start going wrong. perkins plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swang that spade awfully hard.

horrendous pillaging of a classic.it wasn't written convincingly at all why mary should develop such sympathy for bates. he may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him, but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues; lying about the knives, etc... ) this, in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept mary extremely wary of him, but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the 'mistaken-identity-murder-game later on. which in itself is also ridiculous: 'so-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him! there were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending.it was good to see perkins reprising his famous role again, but that's about the only small pleasure to be had. it's definitely not a patch on hitchcock, and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all.

this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent. in particular, dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here. i might have chuckled once or twice during this film, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure. the premise, although routine, still wasn't bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere. don't waste your time with this misfire.

this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. it is not funny. it is not interesting and should not have been made.

this movie is so bad, it can only be compared to the all-time worst "comedy": police academy 7. no laughs throughout the movie. do something worthwhile, anything really. just don't waste your time on this garbage.

his first movie after longtime friend john belushi's death, aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for belushi.instead, "doctor detroit" gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as mom. that's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a pimp's dinner (or something like that) to attend. no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. why should the viewer be alone?it was on this film that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon. at least some good came out of this chaotic mess.one and a half stars. you want good aykroyd, see "the blues brothers". you want bad, see "doctor detroit".

you know those films that have you trapped in the cinema? you're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "when the f*** is this film ever going to end???" (you know the feeling - think of a.i. and the village).well, visitor q delivers a weird variant of that feeling. i sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start! it is interminable! so "arty" it hurts. this is the first miike takashi film i have watched. apparently he makes films by the dozen and, if they are all pretentious w@nk like this, i suspect it will be the last.i'm not against pretentious w@nk. david lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but visitor q is cut-rate, cheap, and nasty pretentious w@nk. as you may have worked out by now - i hated it.

this movie was terrible. throughout the whole movie, i was puzzled and did not see any point to it. i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. this movie is not worth watching at all. not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid! please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies. if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles, than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know. this is a totally sick movie!!!!!!!! i did not enjoy it because it made no sense. my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under. it was total disappointment.

"visitor q" is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter, etc. the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following. however, with home video quality and a slapdash production, "visitor q" just doesn't hold up even as a curiosity. genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible, make-up is awful, and everything else is amateurish at best. a waste of time.

this movie stinks. i don't think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value. the plot was relatively interesting, but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland. this could have been an a good movie. i think it just relied on it's grotesque visuals. i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it. just one poorly executed film. there just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self milking, parental and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersement. i think i just sold the film to many of you, but i meant it when i said this stinks. he has succeeded in other films, but i think you'd be better off watching someone pooping.

there is nothing cool, hip, or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema. how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . serial killers! if they have to dismember total strangers in order to "be a family again," then we don't want them to "be a family." what part of that did you have trouble grasping? why applaud this filth?this silly filth is what you do if you can't do art! one's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as "interesting." this is a camera without a brain. what really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history (or, in this case, a knowledge of anything would be preferable!). instead, this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown, thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as "cool cause it's so far out, man!"). these same violent events actually happen, every day. they are not "just in the film." they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you. do you want those things done to you? a child could have thought this up, it required zero imagination, it is not surrealism. this lazy crap has no content, is saying nothing--it's just the worst of the evening news, & it is saying nothing new, nothing we don't already know. it's "the emperor's new clothes," the director hoping there are enough uneducated children, proud of their streak of inhumanity, for this sloppy filth to fly. i can see director miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .there is no plot to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence. there is no "hidden meaning" anywhere in this poorly made film. it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, but you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not there! to do that you need to view & review a real piece of cinema. there are plenty out there, directed by fellini, bergman, fassbinder, herzog, altman, bunuel, kurosawa, lynch, tarkovsky, peter greenaway, tarantino, guillermo del toro, richard linklater, eisenstein, aronofsky, gus van sant, soderbergh, shyamalan, ordet. why don't you view a real art film by the likes of these giants? this wannabe director, miike, will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn't have the talent! anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like "visitor q." teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon! there's no message, no meaning, no plot, nothing to it at all. there are long lists of art films to learn from--but this "visitor q" is not an art film in any respect. it has no content to it. it's just one banal horror piled onto another, and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen, every single day, somewhere in the world. they are not okay because they are "just in the film." they refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to you. do you want those things done to you? to others? why? because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this. there are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct, but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap. there is no deeper meaning. there is nothing to analyze; why keep trying? i've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made, and keeping up with all the new ones, but i've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this. it's not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world. to make this film, or even to favorably review it, has caused over 50 young airheads who don't know any better to think it's "cool." they may grow up thinking that, convincing others, some of whom may end up doing these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way, by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity. trust me on this,--i know cool, and cool this piece of crap ain't. visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film, and i'm still not sure it isn't, actually. your actions have consequences, son. the world is awful enough already. some violence like this could happen to you, or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this fake art film. believe me, you won't be thinking it's "cool" when someone is sawing your skull in half!

okay, so i get it. we're supposed to be horrified. the idea has been planted. a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this. but don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father'...i mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape, and molestation' porn...horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. it is what actually exists in film. this is where miike fails in visitor q. extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.

this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie, set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst. nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors.overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider. a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash... a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies.

i actually retired from asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish. however, i've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently, and so decided to give them another chance. my first port of call was highly rated director takashi miike's highly rated 'visitor q'. i'd already seen audition, and while i didn't like it much, i do rate it as one of the better modern asian horror films. so, i went into this with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, found only boredom. i suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them. any comparisons to the work of luis bunuel and david lynch is blasphemous as far as i'm concerned; all miike has done here is make a film; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. my headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. don't get me wrong, i'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and i didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it. takashi miike may have a lot of fans, but i'm certainly not one of them; and i certainly hope this is the last time i'll come into contact with one of his films.

anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined. we have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. now, she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water. we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up. we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom. you see, it's all circular. deep, huh? the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors. it's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be. if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are insane. we saw this lousy movie, then put on "zero woman, the accused." oh my god, it was a tossup as to which one was worse. what is going on in japan these days? sick, sick, sick.

(big spoilers) i've seen one other takashi miike film, and that was the very disturbing and brutal 'audition', which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity! in 'visitor q'- which i think means 'visitor question'- he examines, in a very disturbingly gross way, the family unit. miike's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and film-making, but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue. we, the audience, are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure (kenichi endo- who was actually quite good) paying for sex with his displaced daughter (fujiko). then, as the father returns home, he is struck on the head by "the visitor" (kazushi watanabe) wielding a fairly sizeable rock, and for some reason, they both end up back at the family home. the mother (shungiku uchida) is beaten and bullied by her son (jun muto) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers. when the visitor enters the home, he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit. eventually, the family begin to improve their relationship, with assistance from the visitor, through milking breasts, murder and retaining a sense of family pride.and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together. it's has uncomfortable humour, but is equally frustratingly silly, and over-the-top in its weirdness. there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting, but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses. partly because of the situation itself, and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this! the style of the film is poor to say the least, and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak. the characters themselves are all over the place, and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic, there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd! the camera-work is sloppy, and doesn't have that cinematic feel that lynch's work entails. it's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level, or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan. it just seems that miike was out to shock, and the film seems self-aware that it's "trying" to be shocking, and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously. all in all, i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy, but it looks and feels amateurish, and seems to unnecessarily want to shock. miike's previous film, audition, was finely balanced between disgusting horror, character development and technique- which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot. 'visitor q' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting, without really having much to say in the process! ** out of *****!

i like billy crystal, and i thought it would be fun to watch this film, since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together. i thought i had seen all billy's movies but couldn't remember this one, and now i know why. it's so full of clichés and phony emotion; you can smell each scene coming (and going!). billy doesn't even get to be funny very often. he's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down. alan king himself is fairly likable, as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies. but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place, etc. etc. or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la. and when the end comes, boy, does it come quickly! almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene. mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor.

billy crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (alan king), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. the script is sub-neil simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by henry winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. crystal and king try their best, but king is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. jobeth williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character. it's a comedy, i guess, but one that blinks back the tears...shamefully. ** from ****

as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, i was very disappointed with the movie. granted, the costumes and staging was quite authentic, but the hollywood portrayal of this "british little big horn" was truly boring.the amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history. eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin, i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler. obviously, the producers had invested heavily into "staging" and were determined to get their money's worth.despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was, again, boring and their characters were never developed. whenever peter o'toole or burt lancaster finished a scene, i would cringe with disappointment. their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectively.there are worse epics, but this one is not much better.

i really wish that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. this is a film that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. after watching it, you will say that it was alright. it was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. this movie wanted to be "tootsie", but instead it failed.i gave it a 1 out of 10.

i saw this movie in the middle of the night, when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. it's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain bad, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.

i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. even hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel.oth, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.

generally, i've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd, there's probably a good reason for it. i hadn't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones i wanted to see, anyway), i figured i'd give this one a shot.it's really not much different than other movies in the genre, such as the singles ward or the r.m. if you're into those type movies, you'll probably enjoy this.however, if you're not a mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you. there's no way to avoid the overtly religious (mormon) message contained within, and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy. ultimately, if you don't fall within the mormon demographic, you're probably better off watching something else.admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but i didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall.

'baptists at our barbecue' is the best film ever made. now, that i got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken, let me begin my short overview of this tacky, offensive, pretentious and boring hunk of junk i guess you could consider a movie. first of all, the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of christian vuissa, and the tacky, overly preachy, whiny and stilted screenplay by f. mathew smith. i really despise the fact that it sends a very pro-mormon, and sort of anti-every other religion message. yes, the story is about a small town half full with mormons and half full with baptists. it shows all the main and role-model characters being mormon, and being so nice and perfect, yet they are being picked on by the evil, conniving and very judgmental baptists. it shows how beautiful mormons are and how cold-hearted and ignorant baptists are, instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic. i'm a part of neither religion (i'm actually an atheist), but this offended me, along with another countless amount of baptists most likely. it shows the baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the mormons, and the mormons being very accepting, when again, in reality there is a mutual like/dislike between them. sorry, i didn't mean to go off on a rant.another aspect of 'baptists at our barbecue' i didn't much care for, was the acting. the performances are very amateurish and unnatural, especially from the female lead heather beers. miss beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role, and i wasn't too much impressed with dan merkley, who's the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture, but i have to say he's way more talented or shows more talent in this film then heather beers. whoever played the town sheriff was awful also. although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film, it is full of clichés. for example, the main character, tartan (merkley), finds solace with a native american who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life - how cliché is that? to make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché, tartan buys the poor, lonely heathen a puppy dog. ugghhh! if you want my advice, stay as far away from 'baptists at our barbecue' as you can. i saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion. all i got was a, well, piece of crap. grade: d-my ratings guide - a+ (absolutley flawless); a (a masterpiece, near-perfect); a- (excellent); b+ (great); b (very good); b- (good); c+ (a mixed bag); c (average); c- (disappointing); d+ (bad); d (very bad); d- (absolutley horrendous); f (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of hollywood feces).

first of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. secondly, the movie is slow and boring. the acting is not bad but not special. there is a lucky luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. there is a similar subject comedy '' the home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. my final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.

this movie was awful. i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through. i didn't get the point of the movie. what was the point of this movie? the soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting. there was no chemistry among any of the cast members. i don't know this for a fact, but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers. the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot. that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie. i want those two hours back! if you want to watch good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons, watch napoleon dynamite instead.

movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists. new family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other 'inside mormon joke' known to man. anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. you'll be much better off watching hess's other movies (napoleon dynamite, etc..) than trying to sit through this one. the acting is mediocre. jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like "saints and soldiers", and "napoleon dynamite". i would recommend both movies over this groaner.

the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality: go find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever after. though the film had some fine moments and turns, most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline.the baptist/mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about, probably intentionally. a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple.if you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration, which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values (besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-) ), you will be fine with this film. might be shown at a family-home-evening...

i expected this to be a lot better. i love tim burton's work, so i was really excited to see these online short films. well, they weren't at all what i had expected.i don't really know what exactly it is i don't like. i guess they're just sort of dull. the sound bothers me, and most of the characters, although i loved roy the toxic boy, and stainboy.the match girl episode probably bugged me the most, although it was pretty funny.i also don't like the way some of the characters die. like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire, or how the girl who stares died, in general. roy's death was amusing, surprisingly. death by a car freshener. very original ;-) that made me laugh so hard...there are some things that aren't appropriate for kids. just some language and gore. that's about all i have to say! 3/10

***spoilers*** with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean, john carradine, to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune, some 140 million dollars. the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion. there seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight sleepover, not a weeks vacation, at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise.the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia, rodolfo acosta. acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests. later that evening cute little chin greg and laura's,jeff morrow & marry anders,little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond.the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is. we then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest. the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot, 140 million dollars, but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him, or her, in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot.nonsensical who done it, and haunted house, movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother, much less the audience, would have trouble liking. there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s&m sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder. you just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do.even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself! we then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is. the final plot-twist, that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away, was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie.

ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man (john carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be divided up equally. one condition--they must spend one week in his estate to get the money. and if any of them die, the others get more. guess what happens next.... i saw a brand new print of this film on cable. the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. that's about all the good things i can say about it.let's list just some of the problems this film has: the killer is screamingly obvious; the servants are called igor and elga--come on!; some of the sound recording was so bad i couldn't make out the dialogue (no great loss i'm sure); the gore was sparse and very poorly done; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting--so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief. even pro jeff morrow was terrible! the only fairly good acting was from trouper faith domergue (who deserved better than this) and john carradine (who looks painfully old and frail here). i do have to admit though--the closing line in this movie is a gem!why this was renamed "legacy of blood" is beyond me--there's another 1978 horror film with that name!whatever its name is, it's a bad movie. to be avoided at all costs.

this hamlet made for one of the boringest mst3000 episodes ever. i am not a shakespear fan, but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab. it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed. like i said though this one is quite boring. it is in black and white, the pacing is slow, and there is minimal scenery. the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help. this is the one mst 3000 i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep.

you all know the story of "hamlet". i do.  well, the "to be or not to be" phrase (not the speech itself) has been beaten into the ground so many times that it's not very interesting (in fact, it wasn't that great to begin with). in fact, i find "hamlet" a good but vastly overrated play. it's not even shakespeare's best: "julius caesar" and "romeo & juliet" are ten times better, with "a midsummer night's dream" and "othello" not too far behind. "macbeth (knock your table, off his drawers, puck will make amends, ow!)" isn't that bad either. there are lots of others that are better than this by shakespeare. i won't really comment too much on the movie, rather i will dissect the utterly horrible mst3k episode. okay . . . mike and the bots win a card game, get to pick the movie . . . they ask for "hamlet", pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda . . . and prepare for the most boring sci-fi episode of mst3k ever (admittedly, i haven't seen any of the cc ones). while "blood waters of dr. z" makes the viewing of that episode horrible, since it is not really a movie, rather random, spliced-together scenes (i'm reminded of mike's line from "future war": "maybe this is an anthology of short, plotless movies"), the sol crew a lot got off a good many good cracks. can't say the same for here. the riffs fall flat, the host segments (par usual) are at best mediocre, and when the movie itself (which isn't that bad) is actually better (i mean, as a quality movie, not as camp, like "prince of space") than the mst3k version of it, you know the show must be bad. i laughed (the last time i saw it was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times throughout. i tried and tried and tried to be entertained - but i just couldn't. only the occasional line, like "hail queen dilbert's boss!" (and when that's the funniest line of the episode, well, ahem) - and by occasional, i mean every ten minutes or so - maybe me even chuckle. the second time i tried to watch it, i didn't even laugh at the few jokes i'd found funny before, and simply gave up forty minutes before. the movie isn't horrible; it's just a german version of hamlet. the actors are good enough, and though the dubbing isn't the greatest, that's not in itself a reason to hate this film.  four stars for "hamlet"; three, yes three for the mst3k version. ps: why why why, mst3k!

ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul!

i literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. granted, it's shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not, that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based story.the largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters. often during character's interacting, it's nearly difficult to distinguish who's lines are who's. granted, i believe this movie is dubbed in english. certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines.it would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1, although perhaps that's based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget. still, it's absolutely painful and boring. if you insist on hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10

poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible german-tv adaptaion of his classic play. it's obvious that very little money was spent on it. a stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. the movie was ineptly dubbed into english, with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway? mst3k gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.to be or not to be? i wish this movie never was in the first place.

i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k, so i waited anxiously to see this episode. i'll comment on the movie first, then the mst3k episode. the recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget. mix well, then drain of all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron. movie, i give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. okay, now the mst3k episode. i'll admit it, the first time i saw it, i fell asleep halfway through. i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. however, when i watched it a second time, i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around. the trick with this episode is: listen carefully! it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. give it a second chance, and you'll see what i mean. mst3k episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.

note to george litman, and others: the mystery science theater 3000 riff is "i don't think so, *breeder*".my favorite riff is "why were you looking at his 'like'?", simply for the complete absurdity. that, and "right well did not!" over all, i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie. you really can't make much fun of the dialog; bill s was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would disown it. a junior high school drama club could do better.i would recommend that you buy a book and read 'hamlet'.

alas, poor hamlet. i knew him, dear reader, and let me tell thee, this version sucks! i don't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam, but i hope that they're proud of themselves. they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. this version is quite literally so bad, that not even the presence of a great thespian like maximilian schell in the title role can save it. this movie's only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for "mst3k"; mike, servo and crow had a lot of fun with this one.but either way, i'm sure that shakespeare, had he been alive when they made this, would not have wanted his name associated with it. this "hamlet" is not even so bad that's it good; it's just plain bad. absolutely dreadful.

yay!... i think. it's hard to say. it's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. this movie is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. for a setting, it has a few stone pillars, some stone seats, a couple stone crosses and some stone actors. they have no emotion! the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet, and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature. the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though. the voices stuck true to the dull, gloomy, dreary, life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth. i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, i was on the brink of turning off the tv, despite it being mst 3k.not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.

take:1. a famous play2. a director with now ideas of his own who is using3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1.4. an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part he's playing and you'll get: "hamlet, prinz von dänemark"i listened to the radio play of "hamlet" with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed. i hoped that the filmed version would be better, that schell would at least have a body language to underline what he's saying - nothing. then the set... the minimalistic design is not everyone's taste, but usually i like it when there's just enough on the stage to make clear what's the setting and nothing more. alas, that's on a stage, in a theatre. it won't work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings. that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already... let's say if that was the only thing to complain about... i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time. if you've got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on "hamlet", don't watch this one, unless you're a masochist, or really hardcore, or like to poke fun on untalented actors.

i've seen all kinds of "hamlet"s. kenneth branagh's was most ambitious, mel gibson's was quick and to the point, laurence olivier's was the best - hands down. but now we come to maximilian schell's take on the bard.for one, this is a dubbed version of a german tv production of william shakespeare's venerable chestnut. but if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level. having seen it on mst3k helps, with mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white tv, shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of germans acting out an english play and making it look like an ingmar bergman reject.of course, the best parts are the mst riffs. best lines? "i'm gonna unleash the great dane", "i don't think so, 'breather'", "meet the beatles", "hey, dad, will you help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, during a party - "garrison keillor's leaving germany (yaaay!!)".but then there's schell, playing shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive. no doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as paul newman in "the silver chalice". ever see that one? you gotta watch these two on a double-bill!in the end, this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book. at least the book isn't dubbed by ricardo montalban.one star only for this "hamlet"; ten stars, naturally, for the mst3k version.good-night, not-so-sweet prince.

i read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it. i'm a big francophile and art film lover, but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something "arty" or "intellectual" into something it is not. i will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never, ever wanted to actually see. obviously, the piano teacher has some major psychological issues, but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. the film is, in essence, disgusting. i mean, when i saw requiem for a dream, i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly, but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film.

you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies? well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest, then this movie is for you. it truly was like a porn without the sex. or if that analogy is not to your liking, imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench. this is the movie that you would make. -horrible acting -bad camera work -music done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all, and more. for those who are masochists in the crowd, this is a premiere piece for your collection. all i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie, were people who 'starred' in it. their movie career is over before it started.

if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (i say might) have been a hit. have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults? well this is it. every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards. it would be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little of any value whatsoever. the whole thing, from the opening scenes defies logic. dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself. what is really mind boggling, is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash. wow.

jesus christ, i can't believe i've wasted my time watching this movie. i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd. but watching this film almost put me off her. this is absolutely awful! i could have been watching survivor series 93 over this.the lead guy in this was so bland and generic. i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove '91'd his ass through a glass window. i was enraging every time he was saying "lake" and "cabin". i'd kick his ass.jordan ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. a true angel. but she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film. sadly, she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug. it looked hilarious.i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. it reminded me of a time where...nevermind.anayways, do watch this film because of it's awfulness.

i couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all. with the worst actors you could find, the worst script written (mark frost & sollace mitchell) and by far the worst waste of time in viewing. i won't belabor the story as it's really not worth it. but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story. as to the story, it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did. that in reality the wife couldn't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing. that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all. that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up. and the final result of the film is an insult to justice, movie codes, and the male species. the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish, kill whom they want, defend the killer and get away with it, while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim. hard to believe that sollace mitchell, the director and a man, would even want to make this dribble.as to the acting: jordan ladd, the killer, is awful. a loony toons, who does needlepoint during her murder trial (is this allowed in court?) she bored me to the hilt. one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i'd throw up. she's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife. the husband, played on one level by vincent spano, just seems to look and act stupid most of the time. he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him. the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney. she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice. if she would cross examine me anytime, i'd have told her to go take a hike. everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so.i wish i could give this film a zero rating. however we are forced to start with 1. too bad. let's not have anymore painful watching films like this. lifetime can do better then this, i know it.this is a postscript: made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake. as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i'd seen it before and didn't like it or her. i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick. doesen't anyone see that her/his message is that sickness pays. being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director/writer. totally making the male species idiots. well, this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful. we're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie, which in this person's mind deserves to be trashed.and again this loser is shown. why???? can't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie? are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again? get her off tv, films and out of sight. she's just terrible in every sense of the word. phew!!!!

.... may seem far fetched.... but there really was a real life story.. of a man who had an affair with a woman, who found out where he and his new wife were staying,, and she killed the wife,, making it look like a murder rape.......in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him.. so she quit her job in wisconsin... and moved to minnesota..........last i heard she was in a mental institution, security prison....she was still wearing the "engagement ring." that she has purchased for herself... and had told everyone that he had bought it for her.the events took place in a small town in wisconsin,,,,,,, and the murder happened in minnesota......there even was a feature story in "people" magazine... spring of 1988, i want to say on page 39. i remember this as i was in college at the time,, and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital....

i can't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end. and it did. the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer - so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird. no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty. a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings. but no go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the whole trial - that was it. the blonde lunatic was given a truth-drug to prove her innocent but not brett. the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession. but again no go. during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head. even real weirdos do not look that silly fake "i am innocent" like she did. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail, guilty or not. evil, evil men.

i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday, intending to tune-in to something else. out of curiosity, i accessed the comments here, and found myself watching it to the end. i really didn't do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you're "fascinated," and watch it for "another couple of minutes," until you finally just watch to the end. and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano, and their earlier roles. but great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. we all know that perry mason (before raymond burr passed the 300-lb. mark), and ben matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. no real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. actually perry nearly always did this, but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it "reasonable doubt," and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.but that said, holland taylor's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her, in the courtroom portion of this story, made the actions of matlock/mason more-closely resemble the slow, often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real-life courtrooms.every character in this presentation was either insipid, unsympathetic, obnoxious, boring, improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.the ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this. ladd and spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if "3rd-") roles, even in this venue. taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. give this one 1 star for the story/performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor.

"the deadly look of love" is essentially "fatal attraction" with a couple of twists added onto the back half. the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week. it is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation, and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.brett (vincent spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund. even though he has it all, he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet (jordan ladd). janet, a doe-eyed blonde from cedar falls, falls hard for brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement. shortly after the wedding, mrs. brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious home she shared with her new husband. when the police question brett, he promptly points the finger at janet. following her arrest, janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before. her defense attorney (holland taylor) is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it.did she do it or didn't she? how will it end? you can find out the answers to these questions the next time "the deadly look of love" airs on your local station. and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs, and women are crazy.

this is not horror, as the first part was: this is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. but there's boobs, so i don't complain. and real boobs that is. if i understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u.s. of a. which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela "bruce's sister" springsteen.this cannot be thought without the first movie, so i compare this to it. again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological" ones. especially the personnel of the camp. it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. people are older: most of the actors must be at least 25, but i think they're supposed to be 16 or something. some "methods" used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant. actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way.

unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else i would've chosen it. this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance. carol burnett, albert finney, tim curry, bernadette peters, edward hermann, the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn, and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston (father of actress angelica huston)is what made this film so charming. even the 1999 remake with kathy bates, victor garber, alan cumming, and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel. before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains. she had a few bit parts in movies but i don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own. and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom, ridiculous! they couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks, miss hannigan, and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady? it doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie, even if it was only made for tv, it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie.

well where do i start? i think it's very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn. i love the film annie, and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film, but i was so disappointed! the acting is awful, the original annie came out a few years before i was born, i'm now 25 and annie is still one of my favourite films, so i was really excited to see annie 2. the acting was awful in the film, were any of the characters original? very badly written, directed and acted. this is not a film i wish to see again, and any annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed. the young girls singing isn't bad but still doesn't compare to the original

christ. a sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable "tomorrow") but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. this time, annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan collins's plot to blow up buckingham palace or some such shite. the movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: every time the little bugger squeals "leapin' lizards!" i could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line ("unhand me, you stupid genius!") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.

worst movie, (with the best reviews given it) i've ever seen. over the top dialog, acting, and direction. more slasher flick than thriller.with all the great reviews this movie got i'm appalled that it turned out so silly. shame on you martin scorsese

what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film? and not only did he remake it, completely ruin it? the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro (in his most overdone performance, and that's saying a lot) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous, and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood (and mr. scorcese especially)- attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. in any case, this movie is awful. 

this remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.deniro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.gregory peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as "weeds". joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.some good points? the start credits(!), the first view of cody's back when doing dips in the prison, the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats, sam bowden's decent into full-fledged panic, cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.the worst? the "cleaning woman - but not really!!!" part. clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (are there no speed bumps in the us?) the "he's dead - but not really!!!" parts and the aforementioned rambling ending.i may watch the original again, but i've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it.

worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess. scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! de niro's psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical 90's movie psycho killer. the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies. one of my most horrible movie experiences. rent the original it's 100 times better. 

while i can't deny that his movies are often entertaining, i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream "look at me, aren't i an imaginative director?". his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes, the superlative "raging bull".for this remake it appears it was business as usual, though. the dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. the melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic "psycho" score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. the score for "psycho" was brilliantly unnerving, this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying. even the cast, who can be decent at times, deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature'; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden family.the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro. sure, he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. now i'm no expert on american accents, me originally coming from near manchester in england an' all, but surely he could've come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that? being the gifted physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. it was disconcerting for me, as a de niro fan, to be wishing he was off screen, rather than rapt at his performance.(possible spoilers.)the over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment? i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer-not-dead-yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.all in all, a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller'. scorsese and de niro have done much better work together.

i'm surprised this movie is rated so highly, although if i were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c- or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic. not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to, and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know. there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill/beat kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd. so now i've just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be waisted and that way my 2 1/2 hours or so has meant something.

one of scorsese's worst. an average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is de niro playing the psycho. the finale is typically of this genre i.e. over-the-top, with yet another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. i didn't like the 60s original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. i have no idea why scorsese wasted his time on a remake. then again, considering how bad his recent movies have been (i'm referring to his dull buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress, the blond girl di caprio) this isn't even that bad by comparison. and considering spielberg wanted to do the remake... could have been far worse.

i really don't want to compare martin scorsese's cape fear to the classic 1962 cape fear film, but i can't help it. not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear, but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film (cady taking the keys out of the ignition, dog dying) and even using bernard herrmann's score throughout the entire film, he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can't help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene. when comparing scorsese's version of cape fear to the classic version, the remake comes out destroyed by the classic; but even when taking the film by itself, it's still bad.now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick didn't just remake the 1962 cape fear scene for scene, they tried to do things differently. unfortunately this is one of the film's problems. gone is the original crazy and animal-like max cady who is out for personal revenge, the max cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to "save" sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side (his words, not mine). also gone is the stand-up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film, the sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy, magoo, distrustful, and very unlikable. even mrs. bowden is a completely different character - she's crazier than max cady is! the overall story has also been changed around - sam didn't testify against cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version, sam is now cady's ex-lawyer who cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to "save" him.the overall story has been changed, and i don't hold too much against it, but the overall script is also weak all around. other sub-plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture, they are also just poorly written. the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously. these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have, but they have some help in this department as well.now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety. however, scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear, giving the film a cookie-cutter early 1990s look, no sense of danger, no suspenseful scenes, and little style (unless you count animating fire and the skyline style). yeah, there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original, but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe.if all that wasn't enough, the acting isn't great either. robert de niro (being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance) starts off alright as max cady, but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film. the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs. bowden, going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end. as sam bowden, nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film: beige. juliette lewis (who also reeled in an academy award nomination) is decent enough in her role as danielle bowden, but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her.this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes, and i can't figure out why. i wanted to like it; i really did - i mean, if there's going to be a remake of cape fear i'd rather like that one too - but i just couldn't. containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear, i found martin scorsese's cape fear to be a very bad film indeed. the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles - go figure.

i think we all begin a lot of reviews with, "this could've made a great movie." a demented ex-con freshly sprung, a tidy suburban family his target. revenge, retribution, manipulation. marty's usual laying on of the karo syrup. but unfortunately somewhere in universal's high-rise a memorandum came down: everyone ham it up.nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised, lange bitches her way through cigarettes, lewis "ohmagod's!" her way though her scenes, and bobby d...well, he's on a whole other magic carpet. affecting some sort of cajun/huckleberry hound accent hybrid, he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as "problem child". and i want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles, and you have de niro's schtick here. most distracting of all, though, is his most overdone use of the "de niro face" he's so lampooned for. eyes squinting, forehead crinkled, lips curled. crimany, bob, you looked like plastic man.the story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier, when nolte was unable to spare de niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. upon release, he feels nolte's misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin. and we're supposed to give de niro's character a slight pass because nolte withheld information that might've shortened his sentence. de niro being one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable acts, feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside. mmm-kay.he goes after notle's near-mistress (in a scene some may want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, ya know. which is one of the shortcomings of wesley strick's screenplay: utter predictability. as each of de niro's harassments becomes more gruesome, you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens. strick isn't to be totally discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments (de niro and lewis' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film's best scene), but mostly it's all over-cranked. scorsese's cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced, not to mention the horribly outdated re-worked bernard hermann score (i kept waiting for the wolf man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula).thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick. unintentionally comedic, that is. you know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening, but you can't help but snicker out of sight of others? you'll do it here. nolte and lange squawking about infidelity, de niro's thumb-flirting, he cross-dressing, and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed. and bob's infernal, incessant, constant, mind-damaging, no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the "philosophy" he disovered in prison. i wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.i always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it's necessary. this really *is* scorsese's version of freddy krueger. the manner in which de niro relishes, speaks, stalks, withstands pain, right down to his one-liners, is vintage freddy. upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water: "you trying' to offer sumpin' hot?" please. and that's just one example.unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing balsam, peck, and mitchum nearly 30 years later (or want a serious head-shaking film experience), avoid a trip to the cape.

"look, i know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever. whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come."  robert de nirothis was initially a film for steven spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes. and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro. like "jurassic park", "poltergeist" and "war of the worlds", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial. in typical spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. like oscar schindler, robin williams, sam niel, tom cruise and virtually every "daddy" figure in spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys.but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating.an artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. when the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core. this  the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is about.now "cape fear" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese's filmography ("you already sacrificed me!" de niro yells, but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter). what the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on. watch how scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. but more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular. there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment. the reason for this is that scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character. for the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character. resnais can take you around a french hotel, welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, cameron can give you a tour of the titanic, scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook "close up-mid shot-wide shot" combinations, but scorsese can't do this. there's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. he's all about the character. you break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from de niro, and everything collapses. he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-making.scorsese tried to rectify this problem with "gangs of new york", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis, the actor drawing scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.5/10  even as a generic b-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film. look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. still, we have robert de niro to pick up the slack. de niro, who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ, gives the film its only great scene. in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. a kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interest.but de niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by scorsese. you'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work. but scorsese? nope.worth one viewing.

the film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are, and who the characters are. and that is the moment i started to dislike the movie. with all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand, i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything. i actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept.i hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are, which date we are at, and especially what the characters feel and think. i believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience. but after the bad influencing intro, a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time. the lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way. i think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations. for example, a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first, but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well. i think the director is a very good observer about real life.but that is it. after a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story-telling. i really felt like i'm having a big headache because of the non-stop talking characters. it was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs. it is realistic really, but characters always asking "really, is that so" etc. to each other, or characters saying "no" or "are you listening to me," ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache.i also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be. i understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot, but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes.

the plot it's not so original. if someone saw "l'ultimo bacio" there's nothing new. a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that's is boring and false, with everyone asking to others what they think about them. really boring after an half of hour because it's simple to understand where the story is going to finish. this because it's simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie, so even the hardest parts seem normal. to summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said. the family saw from a 30 years old, i don't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations. really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining. perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it. morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie!

the actors did a really good job playing their roles--particularly the mom. however, as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people. and, at times, i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting displayed again and again. the daughter is a 17 year-old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette (complete with lots of "booty shaking"). the son is a guy with low self-esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends--so much that he throws a drug party late in the film. the husband and wife are both bored, but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners (though the wife picks poorly, as the man she "throws herself at" happens to be gay---oops!). i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks. i think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system. however, given that these characters are not typical of the average western family, it seems disingenuous.

beast wars is a show that is over-hyped, overpraised and overrated. let's meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this.cheetor- seriously, they need to have censor bars on this guy. how come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby taz? (at least razzoff from rayman 3: hoodlum havoc is voiced by slip & slide) action blast- if you want a line of show that suck, get g4 tranceformers cybertron- a show that should go down in a toilet. good job creators (sarcasm) show it self-retarded & boring (at least the super mario games are better) this show had a lot of followers sayin' bring it back, but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good.

growing up with the beast wars transformers, i wasn't very familiar with the original transformers, and now that i have seen the awesome movie, and now that i have seen the older cartoon on which it's based, i have to say i like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than beast wars.not that i don't like the bw characters, i just think that characters like optimus prime are better than optimus primal.i mean, "autobots transform and roll out!" sounds a lot better than "maximals maximize!" the voice of the original optimus prime still makes me a strong believer that he's a real commander, more so than optimus primal.besides, powermaster optimus prime is a lot more powerful than optimal optimus. just look on the web! megatron in the bw character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series.besides what's cooler, robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships? gimme the original transformers any day over beast wars!

-me and my sister have right now watch that movie. we have laugh to the deaf. can u imagine on covers there is nomination for oscar?? --first, musician have mix about 4-5 different style of music... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves...---main character silvester do not fit in there. he look like mexican tarzan.----russian soldiers are everything but not russian faces :-) -----ok, the main points: 1. airplane called charter painted in black...2. what is an idea when rambo go to jump from the airplane, but he stuck? rope mix 3. a girl? the best scene is when she dies. she means a lot to him. he knows her for ages? he cries for her, ... o my god samurai 4. how many arrows is he got? his arrow bag is always full of the arrows? i didn't notice a scene where he collect them - but i have seen the scene where arrow stay in the vietnam solder head - that is very important 5. how many rockets helicopter can hold???

usually, any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass. rambo: first blood part ii was no exception to this. the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood. this film is extreamly unrealistic, and boring. it has action, but not very good action. i didn't enjoy watching it, and i would never ever watch this again. no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture. i would give this a 3/10, the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action, but not good enough.

the summary pretty much sums it all up. this is nowhere near as good as the original. with a script co-written by both stallone and james cameron (at the same time he was also writing aliens). most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallone.sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon. he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate rambo.the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam. rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. he is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one. as the 3 flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick-up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on board.rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz. killing many of them, rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centre.a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man.

by rights, there should never have been a "first blood part ii". the original script for "first blood" had john rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment.the official title of this film was "rambo: first blood part ii", but it is more commonly known simply as "rambo". it starts with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in "first blood", although this is never made too explicit. he is removed from prison by his former commanding officer, colonel trautman, for a secret mission. rambo is to return to vietnam to investigate reports that american pows are still being held captive by the communist regime. he is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his is to be simply a fact-finding mission.what rambo does not realise is that he is being set up, not by trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named murdock. murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no american prisoners in vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between the american and vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. unfortunately for murdock, rambo discovers that not only are americans still being held prisoner, they are also being kept in hellish conditions. of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. the rest of the film is more or less one long battle between rambo and a few allies (including a beautiful vietnamese girl) and the evil commie soldiers and their russian allies. most of the evil commies, of course, end up dead, although i was surprised to learn from your "trivia" section that the total death toll was as low as 67. at times it seemed as though rambo was trying to wipe out the entire vietnamese army.the tone of this film is very different from the first. in "first blood" rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. in "rambo" he is a bona fide all-american hero. a few years earlier the director, george pan cosmatos, had made "the cassandra crossing", a biased piece of left-wing anti-american propaganda. cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile, and "rambo" proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right-wing pro-american propaganda. the one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad."first blood" had its faults, but it also had its virtues. its stance, that the anti-war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war, social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. "rambo", by contrast, has very few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing. it is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those americans who were still sore about the vietnam war. rambo re-fights the war single-handed, and this time the right side wins. take that, charlie cong! by this point, no doubt, the film's admirers (and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars) will have concluded that i am a liberal commie-loving pinko. far from it- in fact, i have always despised communism as a pernicious ideology. what i dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems, including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible. it makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of south-east asia or why not everyone in the region was pro-american. for all its anti-communism, the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the communists were very good at churning out themselves- except that they attributed all the world's problems to capitalism, or imperialism, or revisionism, or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to. compared to "rambo", "the green berets" was a masterly piece of political analysis. 3/10

i think it's time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him. this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was. this is not the worst of the films concerning vietnam, that honor goes to john waynes green berets. in any case john rambo carrying around a 50 cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good many russians is an insult to watch. what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the end...please!! oh yeah i heard they are making another one...

the ghost of the vietnam war has haunted the american psyche for thirty years now. if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost. many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original first blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. first blood part ii, on the other hand, is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore america can be, both in victory and defeat. stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular special forces commando, while richard crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. where it all comes undone is in the script, which didn't do any better when it was called missing in action and starred chuck norris. what little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big s on rambo's massive chest.the film picks up a little while after the end of first blood. the film, that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. in this mediocre follow-up, rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. as he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with colonel trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. rambo, never one to back down from a hard day's violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be cambodia or thailand (i forget which). from there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where american mias are supposedly being held, and photograph them. his mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. rambo being rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications.of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning rambo's work have more interest in making sure no american mias are found. it is the age-old conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an american family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official vietnam war had been raging for. of course, with the jingoism that was inherent in american society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of russians. together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. about the only thing missing is the moment when rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible.to be honest, first blood part ii is a well-photographed, and well-choreographed, action spectacle. the hand-to-hand combat with the larger russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. the rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for americans to pump their fist to. fortunately, this fad of america über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as platoon began doing the rounds. some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. the vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. the russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. only in a 1980s action film would one see a law being used from inside a helicopter. sure, there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before.i gave rambo: first blood part ii a one out of ten. it is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. one doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are. the only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved. keep the tongue firmly in the cheek, and it might be watchable.

while the original first blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts. in rambo: first blood, part ii the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action. plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission. just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e.g. invasion usa, commando, red scorpion), rambo: first blood, part ii cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for. if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about?imprisoned after the events of the first movie, john j rambo (sylvester stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the far east. the year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american pows still trapped in the jungles of vietnam. rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel trautman (richard crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by marshall murdock (charles napier). rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american pows  if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date. aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful co bao (julia nickson). sure enough, rambo discovers that there are pows in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any pows because of the political and military implications. rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the pows and get his revenge on the treacherous murdock.the few good points of the film come from jack cardiff's polished photography, jerry goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. the actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. at the time of its release america was under the presidency of ronald reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments. for this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero.

i don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. sylvester stallone is once again john rambo, author and survivor of "a season in hell", recruited from prison by his only friend, major richard crenna, to secretly return to vietnam, take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.fat chance. what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? who would come to see the movie? it's essentially a celebration of stallone's muscles. preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (they are oiled and bulging throughout.) there is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. the black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as stallone's muscles. the bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy's forehead. the knife is sharpened with slick snicks.stallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. no guts, you know? just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.the movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese. the bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (free our mias.) why would they keep them? it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states -- a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the world.as a captive, rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese. dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. then, not content with subhuman vietnamese, a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer -- "vee haff vays of making you remember." a high-tech type, the russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love it," bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. at least rambo's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.the action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless. it marches dully through it's phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. to speak is a sign of weakness.

i remember i loved this movie when it came out. i was 12 years old, had a commodore 64 and loved to play rambo on it. i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap. i put it in my vcr and started up: man this movie is really bad! sylvester stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie (except for that awful sentimental speech at the end), and has the same expression on his face all the way. and that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so amazingly predictable. i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.

as an army veteran, i was deeply offended by this film. in my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war. to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement. if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. but it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. silly as it sounds, wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film. unrealistic? hmm, let's see. a monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow's. in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. and he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm. i could go on, but i'm getting a headache. i gave this a 2/10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii.

years ago, when i was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. and, while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, i couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! that's how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again! now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. and, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! so why is the movie so bad? well, unlike the first rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. and what stupifyingly awful special effects. while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark! and, while the bad guys are using ak-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al. plus, hot shots, part deux also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene.all-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!

this movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies stallone ever made. this is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself. "first blood pt. 2" is very similar to schwarzenegger's "commando", but there you have arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys. this movie is a typical american anti-soviet propaganda. true, this was the peak of the cold war, but i'm sick of having communists or the nazis always being shown as the enemy. there are so many american movies that have this one thing in common. why can't there a movie that show americans as the enemy? who's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army? do you really think that something like this would have really happened? by the looks of it, an average, brain washed american viewer certainly would.

george p. cosmatos' "rambo: first blood part ii" is pure wish-fulfillment. the united states clearly didn't win the war in vietnam. they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. the character of rambo is perfect to notice this. he is extremely patriotic, bemoans that us-americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. like every film that defends the war (e.g. "we were soldiers") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia. and for that matter also the reason for every single us-american soldier that was there. instead, rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. "do we get to win this time?" yes, you do.

an offensively over-the-top action adventure,first blood part ii seemed to catch the mood of the us at the time of it's release in the mid-80's,with right-wing reaganism and virulent anti-red feelings still not finished yet,though the emergence of a certain mikhail gorbachev in the heart of the 'evil empire' in moscow would soon render these types of films redundant;even reagan himself eventually admitted this truism.in that sense,we can be most grateful to 'gorby',not for his disarmament treaties with the us,nor his policies of 'glasnost',or even his support of democracy being restored to the eastern european countries in the former soviet union's backyard.no,it's the final diminution of foolish,jingoistic,bloated cold-war adventures like this.the first rambo film was hardly perfect,though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline.in this sequel,any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly,senseless plotting and incident in which rambo single-handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped vietnamese and russian troops to rescue american pow's ten years after the conflict ended,with the americans on the losing side.perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box-office success was to let many americans wallow in fantasy;they may have lost the war,but there was still unfinished business at hand,and ludicrous comic-strip heroics with a robot-like hero killing virtually every red on sight,with as much hardware as possible,fulfilled such whimsically far-fetched ideals.this could have been entertaining on a superman/spiderman level,but sadly everything is played absolutely straight.but that is not to say that there is no humour in the film;sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind.the action scenes,though technically adequate,never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness,because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts;namely,our hero rambo is always unscathed (aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there) despite the tons of explosives,grenades,gunshots,etc.going around him.in between the mayhem,what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities.stallone,who co-wrote the script with james cameron (a long way from the exciting terminator made the previous year),deliberately seems to have given the rambo character as little to say in understandable english,and merely comes out with moronic grunts,almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself.maybe his colleague cameron was thinking of the terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character! in this sense rambo seems even less of a human than the terminator did! the rest of the cast do little better with good actors like charles napier and richard crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given,and steven berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his russian kgb/red army villain roles.berkoff's overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing.how come that sly managed to survive berkoff's electric shock torture to kill yet more of those red commie scumbags? well,credibility is never this film's strong point.it is a work of fantasy comparable with the wizard of oz.at least that was meant to be a fantasy,and an immortal classic it turned out to be.this is only a classic of the most dismal,and indeed offensive,kind.and as for sly's climactic speech...,rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people,eh? by the way,in the same year,he also made rocky iv..........rating:3 out of 10.

like 'first blood', this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets, but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire, burnings, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia, a ton of vietnamese soldiers, most of the russian army, various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at. the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from russian rat-a-tat to chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at. stallone has a brain in his head; this empty nonsense is beneath him.

well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces. what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the "keeping it real" black cab driver. plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel. then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. the parents are the best part of the flick.

in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience. fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. the plot is thin to say the least, the cantonese dialog is not funny. see this movie at your peril.david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate. the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just blends into the scenery. it was like watching paint dry. in short this movie was a total waste of time and space. i've seen better movies on youtube.

this movie is actually worse than most movies i've ever suffered through, and i've suffered through a lot. absolute nonsense. it's got terrible, forced dialogue; pointless plot developments; really drawn out 'spooky imagery' scenes, which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving said women (forget what you know about virgins! especially ones with lop- sided fake breasts); muttered, difficult to understand speech from some of the characters; and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny, but it isn't. veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film. absolutely give this one a miss.

with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget, (truly) independent horror film. make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective, the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor.the major problem with frightworld is it's length, at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie, plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant.in places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour. however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch.this could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal "serial killer back from the dead" movie with some judicious and ruthless editing, in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut.

(honestly, barbra, i know it's you who's klicking all those "no"s on my review. 22 times?? how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here? don't you have anything better to do, like look at yourself in the mirror all day?)steven spielberg told barbra that this was "the best movie i've seen since 'citizen kane'". that pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning!what are the ingredients for a sure-fire cinematic disaster, and one that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain? the ingredients: barbra streisand's face, a musical, feminism, barbra streisand's voice, barbra streisand directing, and an ultra-corny/idiotic premise.hollywood is full of egomaniacs, this much we know. in fact, nearly everyone  by definition  has to be an egomaniac in hollywood. why would anyone want to act? for the "art"?!? well, if you're dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews and streisand has the biggest ego of them all! this is quite an achievement. to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins, and yet to manage to top them all  remarkable.the movie, like all her "solo" endeavors, is an ego trip straight out of hell. every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined. stillborn. but as it that weren't enough, she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs  you know, the kind that enabled the mariah careys, the celine dions, and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious air-waves for decades now. just for that she deserves not one but 100 south park episodes mocking her.the premise, streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a zany zaz comedy. apart from it being a cliché, the obvious problem is that streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does she look like a man  in fact i'm not even sure she's human. the way she looks in this movie, well it cannot be described in words. e.t. looks like a high-school jock by comparison. she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year 2015. she looks horrible.the songs. they made me shiver. particularly "papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat?" and "tomorrow night i'll prepare the sequel, yentl 2: the return of the bitch".did you know that streisand considered having a nose-job early on in her career, but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change? can you believe that? she should have done it! killing two flies with one swipe, that's what it would have been.if you're interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.should barbra streisand finally go into retirement? click "yes" or "no".

i remember when this piece of trash came out, all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken barbra streisand years to get the film made. well it couldn't have taken that many years; the play only opened in 1975, eight years previously. it made a broadway star of the great actress tovah feldshuh, who probably should have been cast in the film, but nooooo...the great star barbra had to do it her way. and with music no less! this film is a total disaster from start to finish. for one thing, barbra was forty years old when she made it and she looked every minute of it. there was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study torah. and then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. i get the impression that streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. and as if that is not bad enough, she gets involved with both her schoolmate avigdor (mandy patinkin, whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end) and his fiancée (amy irving, who does her usual sleepwalker routine, a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; i won't even bother to mention the "wedding night" scene.then there is the music. nine totally forgettable songs, all sung by streisand via voice-over (presumably as a look inside her mind), and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard.i won't say that streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (patinkin's backside especially), and she has a good eye for balance. the problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way. i did not believe her for one second in the title role; she should never have added the songs, and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes. i was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty-five minutes.awful, awful, awful.

barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish story.to have a chance at obtaining an education, babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy, anyway. at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she's a guy.don't miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs' male friend thinks she's a man, but pins 'him' to the ground, sits on top of 'him', and looks affectionately into 'his' eyes.... *snicker*.mediocre film; splashy story about nothing particularly interesting.

my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room. the whole notion that streisand plays a boy/man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is. the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" . . . it is impossible to do that in this movie.

i know, i know, "plan 9 from outer space" is the worst movie, or maybe "manos, the hands of fate." but i can't get worked up over those sock-monkey movies. of *course* they're bad. how could they be any good? but if you're talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent, the t. rex of all turkeys has to be "yentl." all the treacly phoniness, all the self-absorbed asininity, that stains everything barbra streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culmination in this movie. from its lonely summit of awfulness, "yentl" looks back to "a star is born" and forward to "the mirror has two faces." there is nothing else quite like it. what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine, although i'll bet there's a nine in ten chance you aren't a member of it.nobel prize-winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it. it is a tribute to streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn't commit suicide, but went on to make more awful movies.

this might be the worst film ever made, and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone. streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study judaism. the soundtrack is torturous, featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film. and don't even get me started on the plot. you will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible. the rampant ego of streisand, thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to oscar heights, led to this disaster. i'm pretty sure the novelist, isaac bashevis singer, hated this film and never forgave streisand. i can't blame him. this movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'the sound of music' being played backwards on an old turntable. it's truly that bad. i'm amazed that anyone from streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended.

un-bleeping-believable! meg ryan doesn't even look her usual pert lovable self in this, which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick. hard to believe she was the producer on this dog. plus kevin kline: what kind of suicide trip has his career been on? whoosh... banzai!!! finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill? must be a replay of jonestown - hollywood style. wooofff!

the premise is ridiculous, the characters unbelievable, the dialogue trite, and the ending absurd. believe me, i'm a fan of kevin kline, but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds.for her part, meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth. she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being.this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well-paid for it. so i can't really blame them.

kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing, despite reviews. i have always found ms. ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and kevin kline is almost always worth watching.i say "nearly" and "almost" in large part because of this movie.first off, meg ryan does not play a likeable character, she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. that said, kevin kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable. so, even if you normally like these two actors, i recommend your give this movie a pass.

i give this five out of 10. all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind? there appears to be three cameras on hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider) interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun, complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight

were i not with friends, and so cheap, i would have walked out. it failed miserably as satire and didn't even have the redemption of camp.

i saw this movie originally in the theater, when i was 10. even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.in the past, whenever i would see ed begley jr. or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today, i was unsure why i felt that way. apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work.i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult. i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can *truly* put it behind me. some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.

this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it, surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff. just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time. and the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, or they were simply making it all up as they went along. (*1/2)

andy hardy meets debutante (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into. characters andy hardy (mickey rooney) and judge hardy (lewis stone) were going to be front and center. the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks. the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.lewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner. the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do. mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. andys' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way. even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy (1946) his reaction to any 'teapot tempest' was the same, juvenile.in this film it is clearly illustrated. andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved. this screen writing device was known as the 'idiot plot'. a means of stretching a poorly written scenario. maybe it was less mickey rooneys' fault then the director and the writers. most likely george b. seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control rooneys' excesses. to see our overview of the entire series go to you're only young once (1937).

i must say this movie is a mork and mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, i even wet myself a little. when that korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. any way back on track chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of christmas past. this movie is so bad i put my new born child in a box and left it in mr. norris mailbox. he can raise my kid i'm not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck norris is a karate expert ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.

the shame of it! there i was, comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment. what did i get? disappointed! how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this? the humour was dreadful, the songs were worse than country and western (and that's saying something) and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew. i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island. a short tale, such as christmas carol, is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it....here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun. where do the muppets go next? how about muppets wizard of oz?

the treasure island dvd should be required viewing in any film production course! it's a textbook example of how not to make a movie. watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. call me old-fashioned, but i think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. the director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "hollywood conventions". among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. the director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "hollywood cliché". however, he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason. they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. it's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. the film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of wwii. soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. someone with less disdain for the "hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. this film certainly isn't it! the puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. in particular, i'm becoming increasingly impressed by gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. in a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.

alicianne (laurel barnett) becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon (rosalione cole) who has recently lost her mother. but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house) late at night...where she also meets her "friends"...this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery...then falls apart. the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long. the acting is terrible across the board (with cole easily being the worst). badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture. scenes (and sound) are just cut off with no rhyme or reason. also the film has terrible (and obvious) post-production sound.as for blood and violence--forget it! there's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake. i've never seen such fake-looking blood--looks like ketchup! boring, pointless--a rightfully forgotten drive-in movie. you can skip this one.

if you're going to look after a child, make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard. especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her 'friends'. but, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter. even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths. but enough of that.. domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones. oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.in fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they'd signed up for and gone awol. yes, i know it's hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you'd want. if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting. featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress rosalie cole (the next dakota fanning she ain't) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on. but back up a minute.. earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it. so do they stay where they are safe? no of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown.finally, the film closes. it doesn't end, it just goes to a grinding halt. the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened. but, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened. you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you're ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back. just think.. years from now on your deathbed, what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family. sadly, it's already too late for me. don't you make the same mistake :( 2/10

and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing. the acting and sound is awful. this might qualify for a "so bad it's good" point of merit,,,for some. however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap, i think that's my major complaint. the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times "you startled me" is used. the "child" actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended here..her line "donuts! i hate donuts" is worth repeated viewing however.

this movie was seriously awful. the acting was the worst! it was worse than a student film. super cheesy, and i think the worst actor was the old lady. at first i thought to myself, well it's an old movie. then i remembered that that is no excuse! i've seen older movies with way better acting and such.the music was terrible to. it was really choppy. the editing was poor (most of the dialog was out of sync.)overall, this movie doesn't even deserve a 1. i only watched it because i was so bored, and the movie hardly entertained me. it was just laughable. my dead grandmother's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this.

there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! it's a shame the child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. we have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. the plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). this is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. there's really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don't recommend it.

a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery, and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her. she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and, imagine the suspense here, experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs. whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family. the earnestness exuded by the mrs. whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. well, the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school. none of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on, pause to remember lines, and have all the conviction of a paper bag. the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary. it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends, but by that time i didn't care. the murders are not convincing either, and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there. that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. cheap doesn't even begin to describe the budget here with. it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods. someone lent the director a couple old cars too. no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up. there are so many guffaws/ridiculous moments to list, but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved: 1)watch the gardener's body well after he has been "slain". len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life. 2)the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed. she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. 3)how about the guy playing roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's andy griffith. the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot. the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70's cheese if you will. this isn't a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing.

i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible, because i have seen worse, but it's not even halfway decent. the plot is very confusing. i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going. when the movie was over, i was left scratching my head. i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up, but once the credits were over, that was it. i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two. character development is very shallow. i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone. i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them. this film seems to be based around stereotypes (to it's credit, they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean. stereotypes are easy to depict, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters. this film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible.another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation. i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them, so i never really missed any of them.and last but not least was sadie's singing. it's awful. the music backing her up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords. i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon.as a whole, this movie is confusing. characters are ill-developed, georgia's acting is wooden and stiff, sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. the music was unbearable, and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.

jennifer jason leigh and mare winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic sadie flood, constantly leans on older sis georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the joni mitchell mold. perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. probably hoping for a tour-de-force, leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). if sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. as it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. director ulu grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes sadie's bar performance with georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from ****

mark pirro's "deathrow gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts, but occasionally very funny nevertheless. this movie could certainly have been a lot better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times, but the concept is funny, and it has some hilarious moments.in the near future (the year 1991), game shows have changed. chuck todean (john mc cafferty) hosts a game show called "live or die", in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives, and for money. candidates who fail, get executed on the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other, more bizarre devices of execution, followed by applause from the cheering studio audience. the show is, of course, more than controversial, and chuck has made lots of enemies..."deathrow gameshow" is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects, and the acting is terrible, but it is without doubt fun in many parts, especially if you're a fan of dark humor. you haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it, but it is definitely funny and a good time waster. 4/10

i rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard. lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, i swear! lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar. super homoerotic. lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. there is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. characters personalities change in matter of seconds. one guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good. the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick. i hated this film.

cage (1989) was another one of those low budget "buddy" action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs. and lethal weapon. this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar. reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in 'nam. but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft. although he's huge, lou has the brain of a child. one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them. but payback's a mother. they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing. that is until these two thugs come into the picture (one of them's a real nice guy) who have a plan in mind.the film's a waste of time. maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked. alas, it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag. oh well. it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b-movie. better luck next time, i guess.not recommended.xxx

if you want to laugh like crazy, rent cage. cage is about two war heroes, billy and scott who are best friends. when billy is shot in vietnam, he is unable to fend for himself, so scott takes him in.i have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. billy and scott love to "wrestle" and scott tells billy that he is "still sore from last night," among other things.wonderful catch phrases like "shut the sh!t up" and "ping pang pong, cut the sh!t" will keep you laughing for hours. the native american guys that are supposed to be playing mexican gang members are also top notch. as they say, it's "party time right now. ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba." i could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh your a$$ off. it was so funny i went out and bought the dvd for $5.99

i don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. this movie was complete trash.macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable, cute, sweet, loving, and extremely fun to watch. he had that innocence but at the same time, he was strong as well.this new kid, alex? annoying as all hell! just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably at that.the villains, complete crap. harry and marv, they were such an entertaining on screen team. they were comedic, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root for culkin even more, which is what a good villain is suppose to do. these guys joe pesci and daniel stern, absolutely perfect for those roles. on the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. more on the corny side actually.then we got the actual movies. part 1 and 2, classics. memorable. perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. it makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters. simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. part 3? masterpiece of crap. enough said.all and all, i don't know why people like this. i think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore. its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of.run, run away from this garbage. and lets not even start with part 4!

whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined... same plot, different kid, more villains (which leads to more endless stupidity in the traps). the other two films were bad enough, and this is where it hits rock bottom. people may as well watch the other films for plot, as it's all identical.

i hated this movie. it was absolutely horrible, poor,poor, pitiful acting, real real real stupid criminals that weren't even the least bit funny(unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good). all the boobie traps are weak, pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week. this movie is absolutely lousy, it's not worth even renting. in fact don't even watch it on t.v.! go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two! i barely give this 1 star(out of 10). just trust me when i say, if you liked the first two, and you are not a complete stupid person, you will not like this movie,do not watch this movie!!!

i loved the first two movies, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie. the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car, that can go into another house are ridiculous. joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny, but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny. believe me this movie is just a waste of time.

remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid "movie" is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon. perhaps "home alone 2: lost in new york" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization i have ever heard of. a boy fighting off spies/terrorists when he's home alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox? ridiculous! why did this film have to be made? i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time, but rather learning experiences. however, this is actually a waste of time. it should be avoided at all costs.

home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. it's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like battlefield earth and flinstones: viva rock vegas. in fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. this just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. no other movie has made me cringe in pain. now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.first off, the plot is ridiculous. it revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. dumb stuff.the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home alones, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. i didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, i cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. the bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying.the acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to atrocious. there is not a single good performance here. alex d.linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it.i can see some people saying: "man, it's for the kids. don't dis it, man." well man, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. see monsters inc. and toy story before even considering getting this out. hell, even scooby doo and garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! so in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. this was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well. no human, kid or otherwise, should find any reason to see home alone 3. ever. it's that bad.0/5 stars

i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me. if only i saw a trailer, i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. this movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to hollywood.the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. for example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. it's even covered with clothes. is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? hollywood obviously did not believe so. common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; i doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? please, there's more reality in the matrix. also, the leader puts down his real pistol and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. the traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. but, hollywood intends for us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. i did not laugh; i sighed and rolled my eyes.but, i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one. otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. home alone 3 also raises a question. we all know alex d. linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?

this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen! watch part 1 and two, but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two! i mean, really, you don't make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! i mean, it would have been ok if this wan't a "home alone" movie, but they did make it a home alone movie. culkin is too old now, so you're suppose to stop making sequels! goodness, this movie makes me sick! buy part 1 and 2.

i like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris columbous.this movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. i cant even believe these people are considered actors.painful to sit through and watch. the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself! the movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original. home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot!

in 1987, john hughes wrote and directed 'planes, trains and automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing he's ever done. ten years on he's reduced to again recycling the plot of 'home alone' in this second sequel, which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic. the four crooks  that's right, four! and one of them is a girl! congratulations, hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than culkin. you'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for 'home alone 4'.

alex d. linz replaces macaulay culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the home alone empire. four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car. because of baggage confusion, grouchy mrs. hess (marian seldes) gets the car. she gives it to her neighbor, alex (linz), just before the spies turn up. the spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. home alone with the chicken pox, alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police while alex is accused of making prank calls. the spies finally turn their attentions toward alex, unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house. home alone 3 wasn't horrible, but probably shouldn't have been made, you can't just replace macauley culkin, joe pesci, or daniel stern. home alone 3 had some funny parts, but i don't like when characters are changed in a movie series, view at own risk.

the first home alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. this one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. the new score is quite bad(though the new "setting traps" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. it (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it's just not the same. the plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it's still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the 'scary character turning out to be good'. the acting is mostly unimpressive. the characters are mostly caricatures. the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). the fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn't work. the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children's film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that isn't the first time in the series). it's also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. i could follow it, but i doubt a kid could. some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. the animal stuff is generally not amusing. there are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. all in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. i recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10

'home alone 3' is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains. however, the plot is very similar to the original 'home alone' film. instead of two comical villains, we get three or four of them. this film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-control car. the slapstick humour is consistent as well, but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film. (no pun intended.) this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not the warm, holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had. it's more of a pure comedy, but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me. i would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy, then watch the original 'home alone' movie.

beating the bad guys... again is the tag line for this movie, it exposes so much truth about it.home alone one and two, film classics. home alone three and four, a good film if you're three! like sharkboy and lavagirl, as hard as it tries to be funny, it's not. culkin is replaced by alex d'linz or something else. he's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions. the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks, and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real. a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day. and to make things worst, a totally different cast, go see if you don't believe me, but you'll regret it.

the first "home alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. the second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! now comes "home alone 3". i was curious how they could continue with the same story considering kevin would've been 17 by 1997. he could take care of himself, right? so, what does the director decide to do? he takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. the kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? what kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots? i don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie. but please, i'd recommend that you'd stay away from it. it's not worth your precious time. go fold a piece of paper, do chores, balance a pencil on your nose, or take a nap! it's better to do then to watch "home alone 3"!1/10

this is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash i've ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. if you think that ed wood's "plan 9" is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like "citizen kane" compared to that one. ¿special effects?...again, "plan 9" is "star wars". ¿acting?...thor johnson is al pacino... so it's beyond bad, really. but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it's for you! i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies, the price-corman-poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "star creatures" they descend right down to the z level. of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can.

some things need to be clarified. the picture of mark ferris is not the mark ferris who starred in this movie. i know that because he was my dad. please remove that picture. also, mark ferris was the writer, at least one of them. i have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. it has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy, that would be great. the movie wasn't all that bad, and trying to compare it to todays world of star wars and other high tech sci fi's it futile. if you watch it, just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses. lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films.

invasion of the star creatures would definitely be in the "so bad it's good" category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist. that it is such just makes it plain bad.it has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in queen of outer space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this instance, native americans) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b-westerns. in terms of being non-funny, the same walking-through-the-cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie. ray does do one good impression of jimmy cagney (but can't make it work for two impressions of cagney in a row, nor handle a peter lorre when he tries it). there really aren't any production values to speak of, as the "star creatures" make the ro-man from robot monster or tor johnson in plan 9 from outer space look like creations of industrial light and magic.this film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema...not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all-night drive-in.

- let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s. i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. the problem i have is that none of it works. a parody should be funny and this one just isn't. not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile. in general, i am easily entertained, but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures.- i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning. the two "stars" make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet. these two come off as bowery boys wannabes. why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me. after the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits. it's all just a complete waste of time.- i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls. that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures.

gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes.i love 50 sci fi, i even love cheesy 50s sci fi, but this film is really, really bad. and not in a mst3k kinda way.virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best "hip cat" impression of abott & costello.chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, such as in "cat women on the moon" but it can't in this case. this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature.that said, i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so.

this was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970's, usually on the "4am movie" or one time, on the 7:30 pm "channel 6 big movie" and still another on creature double feature.when local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time) it was of the time. a couple of low-rent abbott and costello wannabees(frankie ray and robert ball) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in army surplus remainders) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation, and wind up encountering extraterrestrials. they first go into bronson canyon to what would be later the famous batcave on batman, and encounter the remains of a dead "carrot monster". later, in the cave they're chased by a living carrot creature-basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head, with sparkly things on it and ping-pong ball eyes. two of them-complete geeks,ray and ball-are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being "examined" by space amazons-dr poona(nooo kidding!) and professor tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini "uniforms". we were too young at the time,to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this "examination" scene would more than suggest. turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster, are stranded on earth with a ship that's well hidden and are trying to return to their world.the film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when eric von zipper and his crew from frankie and annette's films, were the height of b-film, drive-in comedy.so it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.for some reason i only thought i'd imagined seeing this film to start with. no, i really saw it. and when it was released on "restored" dvd i was assured in my memory. the comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid, but whatever.the budget is non-existent, which, is a minor miracle when you think about it, that it even got made and we can talk about a "restored" version here and now-over 40 years later. the payoff is the girls who want to learn about "love" and "kissing" and, the upshot is the geeks-which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out. it's just goofy and silly and for the locations, has nostalgic significance.

i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film, but this is too much. in the end they look like a bunch of loonies. this film is one of those finding yourself 70's plots, i know the film is made in 1980. a lot more of clint and girl friend movie. this movie is a 3/10.

sondra locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her. but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. it's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good eastwood. there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. wow! could a film be any more boring? i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. a real stinker. don't bother with this one.

clint eastwood is bronco billy, the leader of a wild west troupe, one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling-to-break-even touring show. the seventh member of the bunch is a woman, billy's assistant, but such women never last long, and the position is chronically open. enter antoinette lilly (sandra locke  eastwood's girlfriend at the time). it seems miss lilly, as doc (scatman crothers) calls her, is a would-be heiress who will only receive her long-deceased father's estate if she's married by the time she turns 30, so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish geoffrey lewis.so, what's the plot of this film? it's hard to say. there's the romantic tension between billy and miss lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she's so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes 'one of the troupe' halfway through the film, it's not only unbelievable, but the audience is well past caring about her. there's the chronic lack of funds behind the wild west show, but this topic isn't touched upon enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film. there's miss lilly's predicament of being stranded in the rural west, cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury (she's mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press). but are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?no, the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin. this is a warm, fuzzy film  or at least tries to be. along the way, clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent film. one of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge; billy bribes the local sheriff. the show's tent burns down; an orphanage makes them a new one. but numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make.compounding the problem is the acting, or lack thereof. aside from scatman crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish. eastwood isn't on top of his game either, though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch.and for all this, the film plods on for 116 minutes. to what point? good question  4 out of 10

sondra locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her. but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. it's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good eastwood. there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. wow! could a film be any more boring? i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. a real stinker. don't bother with this one.

ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours. when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left. but, ever hopeful, i stayed. and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time. acting was ok, but the story line is so transparent and weak. the script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue.

this movie is hilarious, not in good way. the fights are awfully bad done, while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie. a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi's, pick up a gun, start shooting back and not get hurt. the story empty, guy waking up, lost his memory, starts fighting cos that's what he's good at. five years later memories come back, takes revenge blablabla. not worth your buck, not really worth your time unless you're drunk and bored.

this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it. what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? how on earth did they get funding for this abomination? the plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... what story? the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.i guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.*** spoler alert ***i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...i give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade imdb has to offer.do yourself a favour: see an uwe boll movie instead... twice... it's more worthy of your time.

i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan so when the sci-fi channel ran this movie,i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond.there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.it's just one long bad dream.i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway.i wouldn't waste your time on this.

apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is. at one point in this film, someone (i believe pacino's producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii. instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al (was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act - but apparently it's how al really behaves in person.enough rambling. here's a shotgun smattering of why i didn't even make it 3/4 of the way through this: 1) pretentious - al always knows when the camera is on him, whether he's acting as richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes, also, some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme. if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside, it's unbearable. "look at me, chewing all the scenery!" 2) winona ryder. when she appears as lady anne, this film comes to a screeching halt, which it never recovers from. she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes. her performance is dreadful, to boot. 3) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture. of course, you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films (or doing richard in the first place). i'd rather watch bobby deerfield than this.lastly, read the play and learn it for yourself. go out and see it performed. in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater, and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama (except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence! my god! was that necessary?!)it's all just a bunch of sound and fury, signifying nada.

it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and i say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. i'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. on the whole, a b-movie, hardly worth your money... vote: 4/10

this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. in summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or gummint if you prefer), the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots, and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. the only people that get done over are the good ones, like mr clooney ("bob"). oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . that really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.in syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: 1. the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again 2. people like clooney and hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script 3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see claude chabrol's "l'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted. empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.

considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.

we gave up at the point where george clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. we were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. to say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! how did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an oscar? clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. what was he thinking? oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? the film was hard enough to follow without that as well. i pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.

contrary to most other comments about "syriana" on the imdb web-site, i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space.in short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so "story-lines" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. no, sir, it does not. what does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.this kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.thank goodness, then, for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again.

i have seen and liked the original film, and expected more from a remake than this.good: effects and makeup are good. no complaints about the score and visuals, they are adequate, and the performances were okay (tim roth was excellent, the other principals were fine, and a handful of the "supporting supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). the action scenes were exciting and fun.bad: the escape from the ape city was terrible. the characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape. plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?the story was pared down to include as much action as possible. i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.finally, the ending was completely nonsensical as presented. without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it.

the acting was bad, the script was bad and the ending was just terrible...the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up...but apart from that...this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001...why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it...why!!!!

this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. he has done it with `batman', `sleepy hollow' and now this. this is not a remake. the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and charleton heston makes a cameo). burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.the original planet of the apes was a product of its time. during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization. it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. in that context, pota was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. the dialectic between colonel taylor (charleton heston), dr. cornelius (roddy mcdowall) and dr. zira (kim hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties. this is apes for dummies. it is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. the `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `i know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'from a technical perspective, as is always the case with burton's film, the film is excellent. the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding (though i continue to dislike his dark look). however, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.the story has been reduced to a monster movie. the humans band together behind captain davidson (mark wahlberg) to fight the monstrous apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably helena bonham carter as ari). the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.the acting is mixed. mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. this part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire. helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.then there is tim roth. his is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade. he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time. additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.this film is a great disappointment. it is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. i rated it a 3/10. from a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. however the story is an insult to the original franchise. it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.

if there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. this "re-imagining" of planet of the apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. nova, the girl in the original planet of the apes, was a better developed character than daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.there were problems in basic plot development. the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out heston's taylor as being different from the other humans. in the current film, mark wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. they are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg. her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth.the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson (wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. this was poor character development. (estella warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in the green mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. but the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.in the original film, the various "human" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ("i never knew an ape i didn't like." "human see, human do!"). here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet.nothing made me cringe more than the "v-ger from star trek" moment near the end of the film. first of all, the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form. secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. this moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. i'm thinking of 2001: a space odyssey, the 1967 planet of the apes, thx1138, soylent green, silent running and the 1972 solaris. the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. however, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. in a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's "science fiction" you don't have to!overall, burton's most disappointing film.

warning: spoilers galore!tim burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - i rest my case.movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. marky mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.the perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to saturn to conduct these experiments? the special effects team decrees it.marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the time warp. marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.before anyone can say `pointless remake' marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.surprise! it's apes doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty-three years ago.since marky mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. michael clarke duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. helena bonham-carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout. paul giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes `re-imagining': `the apes of roth'. while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke, tim roth, as chimpanzee thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. nice twist.the original pota (1968) featured a leading character, charlton heston's taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when taylor discovers the statue of liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed. is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky mark's leo? or roth's thade? no, but there's lots of running.the slogans cry: take back the planet .but it's the apes' planet. in this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes deserved to inherit the planet! along comes marky mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators, simply because they're there. `taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `a planet where men evolved from apes??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he was ben-hur, michelangelo, moses! to cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect? marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. burton tries to elevate marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. in the original film, the apes deem taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. that irony again.it was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, thaddeus roth. as roth's ape-dad, charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the humans this time, `damn them! damn them all to hell!'the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. while thaddeus is giving marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with marky's chimpnaut in it. apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).no matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating, `it's a madhouse! a madhouse!!...'

thank you hollywood. yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. the original "planet of the apes" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. this movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues. instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. the make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. however, this does not distract from the fact that "planet of the apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. please hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.oh yeah, the ending did not make any sense whatsoever.* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals

yes, chunky, this is the nick-name that donna reeds' romantic lead played by tom drake tags her with! so lets get this clear right away. from her first ingénue role in the get-away (1941) too her last, dallas (1984-1985) ms. reed could never be described as chunky. not this attractive and slim actress. whose roles at m.g.m. seldom lived up to her talents.ms. reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball' comedy. clearly m.g.m. was out of their depth making this type of film. a type better produced over at columbia, paramount, rko and even universal. neither the 'touch' of ernst lubitsch nor the wit of preston sturges could save this film. a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war (wwii) effort.if irving thalberg had still been alive the screen-play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. it did fit into louis b. mayer's 'safe-zone' of none challenging family entertainment. a form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the 'dehavilland decision', loss of their theater chains, television and would contribute to m.g.m.s decline. fortunetly for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity (1953) and her oscar win as best supporting actress.

i'm a jean harlow fan, because she had star quality. i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress, but she certainly was great in comedies. every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good. but this movie is perhaps more like a love story. jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new. it always impresses me much to think that harlow's beautiful body was that of an ill woman. well, in this movie she does look beautiful.

this film has a weak plot, weak characterization, and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it. it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film. the robots are sad and the main "hero" 'bot is turned on by a huge knife switch. if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is killed. it's sad when you root for the bad guy, because he's the best one to cheer for. when all is said and done, this movie was better left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.

there's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland, and robot wars does deliver. sure, the acting is lousy, the dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period. they are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures, so it has aged fairly well. its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime, and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable. i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction.

this movie doesn't have an awful lot to do with it's predecessor "robot jox". this must be also the reason why its most common name is "robot wars" and not the alternate name "robot jox 2: robot wars"."robot jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future. this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn't very original or cleverly written. a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really, for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch.just like "robot jox" this is a b-movie but with as a big difference that it's just not a very good one. perhaps this also has to with the fact that "robot jox" got made during the '80's, when b-movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it, even though the movie got released in 1990. this really can't be said about this movie. it's just lame, badly made, poor looking and not exciting enough. it also has an ending which leaves you thinking 'this is it? that's all?'.what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot-line really. perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story, some action, or likable main characters.seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie. all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he's god's gift to woman and mr. perfect who can compete with anyone. weren't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie?for such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having large battle droids in it, this movie surely is lacking with its action. had they put some more and bigger action into the movie, the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch. instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable.you can better watch a "mighty morphin' power rangers" episode, for some more action and likability.3/10

i first didn't want to watch this film, for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film...but as i recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising "mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité"" which was beautifully directed and written by laurent tirard (screenwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), i changed my mind and decided to try it, thinking that "prête-moi ta main", would be as good as "mensonges...". and it is absolutely not. the script is not bad, but it is not as well directed as "mensonges...", the actors not as generous (especially charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as edouard baer or clovis cornillac, and too be honest, i still don't understand how such crap can have such a success, even with such a casting... anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it is not as good as tirard's "mensonges..." though it's also written by him. easy, unsurprising, and lazy work. totally overestimated!

if there is a hell, it contains a screening room in which grand canyon is playing over and over again on an eternal loop. one would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - danny glover, alfre woodard, kevin kline, mary louise parker - would help make up for the presences of mary mcdonnell (whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity)... but, no. apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from mcdonnell. the entire affair is pretentious, overblown, insulting (if you are deaf or know anyone who is, be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous tdd scene). grand canyon is filled with obnoxious, self-involved people, but never gives us a reason to like/understand/sympathize with or even tolerate them. with rare exception, they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without. there's no plot to speak of, no character development (these people won't ever develop), no break-out performance and the most arch writing you'll ever encounter in a film. the best thing about grand canyon? its title. this is one large hole of a movie.

why me? why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! at least if i can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.i had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. otherwise, i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. the movie was slow, had painfully little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la-style token black man.if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. note, though, that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an "la lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it.

oh what a condescending movie! set in los angeles, the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst.stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. the plot is disjointed and desultory. numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.and through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological "insights" imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. one character tells another: "when you sit on the edge of that thing (the grand canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, i could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that grand canyon".and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: "there's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... grand canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ...".aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. acting is uninspired and perfunctory. the film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change.

this series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of dickens' bleak house on film and perhaps someone will read the book. contrary to what is probably received opinion, diana rigg was poor as lady dedlock. she was clunky and wooden. lady d. is a reserved character but not a martinet. denholm elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for mr. jarndyce. so i'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying: "i didn't read the book, so i don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book." true and not true. for ex, diana rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you've read the book. on the other hand, denholm elliot is a passable jarndyce (although too old). the series fails not because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters just don't coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. it is dull and flat. if you want to make apossibly good bleak house, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. but i suggest that producers etc. leave dickens alone (even a christmas carol). television deadens the genius of dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.

herculis puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not agatha's mistake. the cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. the scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! the 'victim' is not likable.

this movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father. very predictable. both male "stars" need a good slap in the face! would you like some cheese with that "whine?" two chuckles...and a headache. i can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years...i don't know how she lasted that long! the first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the $3.99 to watch it! the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long. i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster...it didn't. the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space. on a positive note...the scenery was pretty, fall being my favorite season. the car, the 40 ford was also quite nice. this movie gets an d- rating approaching an f

this is the single worst movie i have ever seen. let me say that again: this is the single worst movie i have ever seen.it had all of the ear-marks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies. the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you. this movie gets and f in this category. the second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to care. this movie gets an f in this regard as well. the first story, a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her. the next story, an ocd guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his. oh, and then there is the horrific, nail-biting story of a bad roommate. come on, could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anal-retentive, and having a roommate? turns out all of these stories where hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself. wow, stupid.let me explain something, i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. i couldn't do that with this one. it was utter pain to sit and watch. do not under any circumstance watch this movie. you will regret it.

this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it. this movie was not just bad as in low-budget, badly acted, etc. although it certainly was all of those things. the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer, and doing it with great success. what i want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? i mean, it's definately horrifying, but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be. i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing, but what the hell is the second segment? it's just annoying. the third segment is like watching an artsy student film, which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment. it's an atrocity that this movie isn't way low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people!! i know some people gave this good reviews, but, well, they're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you. trust me, it is impossible to like this movie. the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life-extending effect: it feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed.

long on action and stunt work, but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest. not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who's doing what to whom.

this was a new alltime low among westerns. the writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism. 'ride with the devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect.

this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours. someone please tell me what the point was?i mean, i understand the historical setting. it's supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) on the missouri-kansas frontier, taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the u.s. civil war. but aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie. perhaps it was a political statement? that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? if that was the point it was done quite well, but i don't think that was the point. i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here, but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot. it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life, with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels.this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched!

i am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . wm c quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period. frank james was never mentioned, cole younger , ditto , and bloody bill anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. the costumes were wonderful however, as was the location shooting in missouri. i hope ang lee will make another film from the period and try again, or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .

okay.. this wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed. i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another, that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting, etc, etc. (well, that's my presumption, anyway =^_^=)at any rate.. the movie kind of bored me. i've watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on.. basically because i just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters. i just kept thinking.. who cares??? i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained. i understand that this was the 1800s and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural. no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.the "romance" in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than "i'm a guy and you're a girl", which i don't consider much of a romance, and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love. oh well.. i guess it's the whole "all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to" type thing, or whatever. i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl) but that was just sort of dropped. maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle. i don't know.oh well.. daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked. and sue lee was all right. i didn't exactly dislike jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, i guess. jack bull i did not care for at all. and i'm pretty sure you're *supposed* to hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right. it was pretty graphic and had that whole "the horrors of war" thing down, but i've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, done better. (i enjoyed the patriot a lot, for instance, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative) but, as i've already stated, i'm a cynic. what can i say? :)

very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. although released by rko, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. the cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited jack lord, director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. the performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. however, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. the location shooting in new york city, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior "the naked city", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. otherwise, it's not much to write home about. it is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets..

"demons iii: the ogre" is not related pre-sequel are on "the demons" and "the demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic."demons iii: the ogre" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. i am very confuse about the writer is "demons iii: the ogre" (lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored william shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from spider's web or what huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). i am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. i bought the special dvd box called "demons" on the 3 different movies called "demons iii: the ogre", "the other hell", and "black demons" don't have closed captioned and subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from best buy store in the city of downey. why the lamberto bava and dardano sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like "halloween iii" don't have michael myer monster but the people wear halloween. i am very confused. i really love "the demons" and "the demons 2 are better the boring stupid "demons iii: the ogre" is not part for "the demons" and "the demons 2" are same demons.thank you juan antonio de la torre

(aka: demons iii)made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films. it was supposed to be simply titled, the ogre, which is how director lamberto bava had released it.an american family rents an italian villa for the summer. the woman (virginia bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. it drips what looks like green paint.of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.the films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. there's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's jeep cherokee. the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected. extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases. this is pretty standard stuff.3 out of 10

this was really a very bad movie. i am a huge fan of italian horror, argento, mario bava, fulci and yes, even our good friend here lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. i found the first two 'demons' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really, really bad. it is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and i hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the *** wife drove me mad, there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film. i turned it off about three quarters of the way through because i was very, very bored! don't bother.

the thing that really gets me about this movie (that is, the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill) is that someone actually paid to have it made. there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie. it is not frightening, it is not thought provoking, it is not entertaining, it is not good. it is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. the dvd case compares it to blair witch, evil dead, and a few other decent movies, making the filmmaker's desperation glaringly obvious. it is nothing like any other movie ever made; it is far, far worse. the claims of an "extremely shocking ending you will never forget" are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings. please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash, because it may make you sterile. the man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the writer's guild membership list, and never allowed to film anything again. because if he thought this was a movie worth making, he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future. zero stars. may grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this. i am going to go vomit now.

this movie was extremely boring. it should least not more than 15 minutes. the images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.usually i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments. i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.what more can i say? i fall asleep during this movie 3 times. it was about 4 hours after i had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period. i think it is the point itself.there is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.when you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again.

the plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods. soft for digging follows the old man's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination. however, there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found. soft for digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film, an old man living by himself in a house. during the film i found that i was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man. the rest of the film i have to admit did not engage me; i found the tempo of the film a little too slow. the limited dialogue was not a problem. however, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, took too long. i feel more could have been made of the relationship, ghostly encounters, with the child and the old man. alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations, children are always scary as ghosts, see dark water.

jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis.i didn't find this particular episode that funny: the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame (jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one, tormenting poor tom for no particular reason).there is the occasional flash of inspiration (such as tom's literal 'heart in mouth' experience, and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body), but, on the whole, this effort lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t&j's other cartoons.

tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on tv. however, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the "phantom." he's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. jerry, meanwhile, is watching tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.we then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which jerry tortures tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. if the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, i have a hard time rooting for the "little guy."these early t&m efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. sometimes that one minute makes a difference. it did here as this actually dragged for awhile. it could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. that's usual for tom and jerry's. usually, they are much faster-paced.

don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series. it is a six hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. there is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. it is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come. and it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency. take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile.

this is the worst piece of crap i have seen recently. there is nothing good about this movie. the plot is plain stupid, dialogs don't make any sense, humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor. actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. the script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with ed wood and uwe boll. there is only one good thing in this flick, the fights. they are well choreographed as one would expect of the hong kong guys, and are the only reason to watch prince of the sun. although i believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline. however, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end. avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady cynthia rothrock.

oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie's new wife and baby. the problem is, they don't exist--ollie apparently made them up! so, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.this isn't a particularly unique story idea, as i've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. the best of these was bobby vernon's don't kid me. it is much better than one too many--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. now i am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. sadly, at the end of one too many, that's exactly what they do. none of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. there's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself.

stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive (separate) film careers before they were eventually teamed. for many of ollie's pre-stan films, he was billed on screen as babe hardy ... and throughout his adult life, hardy was known to his friends as 'babe'. while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music-hall act for bernard delfont, hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname: early in his acting career, hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardy's plump cheeks (the ones on his face) and said 'nice baby!' hardy's workmates started crying him 'babe', and the nickname stuck.although much of hardy's pre-laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west -- his teamwork with billy ruge (who?) in a series of low-budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed. hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt: names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because ruge (although shorter than hardy) isn't especially a runt. seen here, hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.'one too many', an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'that's my wife', one of laurel and hardy's most hilarious films. plump (hardy) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady. runt (ruge) is the porter. plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john, whose dosh he expects to inherit. his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plump's wife and baby. there's only one problem: plump hasn't got a wife and baby. he's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. now, of course, plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. of course, the results are disastrous. it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they aren't. most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.spoilers coming. vim director will louis (who?) shows no instinct for camera framing: the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy, and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. this could be funny if done on purpose, but it's merely inept. at one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress. 'surely they wouldn't stoop that low for a laugh,' i thought. but they do. runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as plump's progeny.somehow, plump acquires an infant's cot, but he still hasn't got a baby. with uncle john coming up the stairs, plump conscripts runt for babyhood. this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as chester conklin, but billy ruge is only slightly below average height. ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. amazingly, he does!the most notable aspect of 'one too many' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by madelyn saloshin, oliver hardy's first wife. the marriage was not a happy one, although hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurel's. only one thing in this movie impressed me. there is a very brief flashback sequence, with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. in 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks: the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. too bad this movie has no other merits. 'one too many' is definitely one film too many on oliver hardy's cv, and i'll rate this movie just one point out of 10. laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.

its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies. they are so unbelievably formulaic. and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier, i'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams, i know what you did last summers, and urban legends.valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. as always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. lots of t&a on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.the thing i can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its?'. the thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered. usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway (eg. main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog). everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect', but they are more 'red herrings' than suspects. as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************spoiler!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** in valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way. the issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?this still didn't make valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still doesn't count for much. to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines, please don't. originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.

the good: i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me. the acting wasn't too bad, and the "cupid" killer was believable and disturbing.the bad: the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. there just wasn't much to it. the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.overall: a good scare, but a bad story.** out of *****

well, not yet, at least.it's not listed in the worst 100...so let's all team up, and put it in it's rightful place.this is truly a bad movie. (and i liked ishtar!) ;)

if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide, avoid it like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!a steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is! there is only one funny scene (the memory eraser scene) but even that rates only .001 on the laughometer (out of 1000). whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives.

i wished i'd taped men in white so i could watch it again" what ? you mean you really enjoyed it theo ? " no i mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded , stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it a lot of people have claimed it was made for children . may i suggest it was also made by children ? because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time the cast don't help but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them . honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this . to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time baywatch babe donna d'ericco disappeared from the narrative i waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie . got that ? a star from baywatch appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie . this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the goodies ( although the dismals would be a better adjective for this movie ) , though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour , but considering this is a kids movie ( this didn't stop itv broadcasting it at 11 pm ) then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway

this film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? the sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical. it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage. national lampoon once made animal house, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious. now they've been relegated to making tv movies like this lump of ****. name your expletive, and it could be accurately used to describe this film.

although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie. in part because i usually give every movie an even break, and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. i stand corrected. not even george kennedy, barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh. namely during the simon says scene. the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. and some of them you actually see coming a mile away. this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane! (i+ii), naked gun (i+ii+iii), or scary movie. they all had a. funny gags, b. good dialog and most important of all c. unforgettable quotes. men in white has got d. none of the above. to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. avoid this movie anyway you can! consider yourselves warned!

i won't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment. i just want to add it because all the comments were so positive i felt like i just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma. some scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but couldn't hold up the rest. i felt like i was stoned for the first time again, having semi-philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents.what a futile attempt to raise dutch cinema to new heights. i'd rather watch jesus is een palestijn, without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.gert de graff is not jean-luc godard or tarkovsky and appearantly never will be.

from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu "i'm so wooden i could be a plank me" reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist'). wish i'd spent the £3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm.... natural born killers: directors cut. if you do buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. if you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead. however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like dog soldiers, wolfen, romasanta:the werewolf hunt.

i don't think you can get much worse then this. put together bad actors, fake limbs, and three stupid stories and what do you get? this b-rate pointless excuse for a movie.the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic, especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit. plus, the man is ok, but the woman is rather ugly. "you look great!" not! the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three i'd say, but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume. the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie.the more stories you go through the worse it gets. there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous. the whole "i want to be a werewolf, too" "how could you do this to me?!" was silly to say. you asked for it now get over it! the werewolf will not even be spoken of...its a rat!the third one has no point...almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting. boring!music, yes, bad...who couldn't even hear some parts it was stupid. animals effects were either rat or pig-like which was stupid. they couldn't use lion sounds? guess not, good movies use that. well, i =f you enjoy b-rates this is good for you. i got this movie since i'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i'll buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once, but thats just me. if you prefer good ones, don't waste your money. i beg you!

the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story. kill kill, would have been nice. the movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs. the scenes are unnecessary and choppy. the movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured. just a waste of movie props and network money. i have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time, but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense. if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night, pick something else. if you have a soul don't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth.

for the knowledgeable beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now. the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.i didn't give this a "1" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors (the band rain) give it their all (the lennon character is credible and does a good job). also, the song "cry for a shadow" is heard at one point and that counts for something.so,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.

i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one. this is it!make no mistake this film is awful.here's a list of reasons:hopeless storyline (despite being based on a true story). dreadful acting (what was judge reinhold thinking) unbelieveably bad stunts. childish dialogue. non-existent continuity. lack of atmosphere.get the picture?

when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking, and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to vacant, metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary. but whatever my own film's failings i feel much better after seeing this...this...thing. for one thing, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content at that: every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four, five, six relentless minutes. the male lead is just incredible, a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub, and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him. admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values; but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper "please" in closeup until the magazine runs out. i take back what i said about autumn born, which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time. at least, i really really hope so.

this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies (which i do)that this is not even amusing. the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. some strangers appear and .... the problem is that most of the film, obviously shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shots of people walking, in real time and awfully slowly, from a to b. this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens. i am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end?

i used to review videos for joe bob briggs' legendary "we are the weird" newsletter. i saw a lot of stinkers, but this by far was the worst, and the years have not been kind - it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed. don't get me wrong - caged terror is nominally more technically competent than, say, monster-a-go-go or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk. what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension. is it a vietnam commentary? an ecological protest? an incitement to race riot? a study of man's inhumanity to man? a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to (nearly) feature length? in short: a hep young urban professional (possibly the most loathesome screen character ever) somehow seduces a nubile asian-american associate into camping in the woods with him. after brow-beating her with quasi-philosophical clap for the better part of an hour, they run across two wandering veterans, the unforgettable jarvis (a righteous brother) and the troubadour (guitar-toting manson family reject). hey, a plot twist! tension! action! suspense! well, no, just a climactic getting-locked-in-a-makeshift-wire-chicken-coop-and-lightly-belittled scene. the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters, "no... no... please... don't..." meanwhile, jarvis addresses the troubadour as "trouby" once every two minutes, bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquer's pod people. that's about all that happens in caged terror, and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable. but trust me, i've seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one has remained, for the past eight years since i first saw it, the absolute worst. (i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself, and reassure myself i certainly do.) i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this: very little happens, and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly, what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really, really want to shove some kind of message down your throat. but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual, what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort. this film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours. it's terrible, truly truly terrible. folks, trust me, i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse. go see it! you'll thank me. and curse me. just for the record, my favorite line: (in caged terror but perhaps ever) "yeah, well, you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christ's love for the church...!" (note: must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension.)

while it's early to say how the series will evolve, i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be. there is still potential for the series, however. of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential, too - but was sorely disappointed. my gut tells me enterprise won't be as bad as voyager, however.as for the impressions of the pilot...the pilot had some good ideas and good themes. i liked the introduction. the show's opening credits were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song. scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain.where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the "feel" of setting out on a grand adventure. the plot of the episode itself was more a "generic" trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step towards space" merely subplot and subtext. were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission, the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise, tos or tng. the central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series. the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the "action". instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a tv show that once again would make us think). make us feel the excitement of "the wind" and being on "the sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay. there was way too much gunplay.we had the feeling more that humans were the "freshmen" in an established school. new kids on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. sadly, the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them. that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological. just how do two such different societies interact? don't just hint about it, show it!i had to think of it more as `trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to `the first brave steps into the unknown'. i wanted to see something newer and fresher. the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven't seen this new, great concept.i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential. there are some interesting characters. bakula is wonderful. blalock has potential. the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11. if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we will have a show which will create new legends.you shoot an arrow into the air... good luck capt. archer.to the producers: take more risks and make us *think*! :-)

this movie really shows its age. the print i saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better prints out there. however, this was not the major problem with the movie. the problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur fashion. sometimes the characters' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces--all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) hide the fact that the film was dubbed. well, its true that this czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious. it just looked cheap.overall, the film looked low budget and silly. it's really a shame though, because there was a grain of a good story--a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women. but in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess. even with a few glimpses of the naked (and somewhat chunky) hedy lamarr, it isn't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted. even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly made dud. about the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image hollywood created when she came to america--she looks like 2 completely different people.it's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film, i don't see how it has gotten such rave reviews. for technical problems alone, the movie can't rate a 10 or anything near it.

it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. in a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. it's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.hedy lamarr is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood. her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (aribert mog), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.the swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. the love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.not so. it's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b. mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in hollywood. he must have seen something in her work that i didn't.it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. the jarring "workers" scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed. it fails to end the film on the proper note.

this movie was worth five punches on my "hurter card". i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid '70's. i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it. it sucked. it was the most ridiculous, total waste of celluloid i've ever seen.i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome. i offer you this: if it was so awesome what was it's box office take? end of discussion.

this is possibly the most boring movie in history. i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director roman polanski. i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again. it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage. my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well. i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, dull and has no real plot. you wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started. i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around. thank god disco and three's company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers. oh well just my thoughts.

okay first of all, i didn't sit down to watch the premier of a "star trek" series to see a cowboy flying around in space. this is how a normal enterprise episode works1 archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship.2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged...in all of the episodes i have seen, all of the problems are happening because of archer's stupid mistakes. oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off. come on!!!! this is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!also what was with the banana slug?? in one episode, hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. okay fine, little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever. okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet!!!!! a banana slug cannot leave in a desert!!!!!!!!!!!! how dumb are these writersany ways, just saying if enterprise is on don't watch it!!!!!

anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector, the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them, the ncc-1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name....need i go on? berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry's creation. after he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. i don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. poor bakula. he's a great actor, as are the entire cast. i like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. just check the ratings. i think more people watched deep space 9 (which was untimely canceled).

despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential. set as a prequel to the original "star trek" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, rick berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a "star trek" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint). the actual show-runner, brannon braga, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck). never have i seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors (jolene blaylock excepted)last so long. it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires. unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that "enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off. produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come.simply put, in a teevee universe where we are given shows like "battlestar: galactica" and "the shield" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a "star trek" that measures up and is dramatically competitive. it is just that straightforward and easy.

i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc. after 30 minutes, i said to him," you've got to be kidding. is this some sort of joke?" he thought it was good. i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. "what was it supposed to be?" i asked. "a propaganda movie made for children?" the plot is stupid. the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life, love or even afterlife, of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view...need some psychiatric help. please, if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player, consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer...it won't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. if they had made razzies in the '40s, this would have won in every category. (ps. it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "stairway to heaven.")

viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence (now that is funny) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me folks, this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see, and if you're not laughing at it five minutes in, i'd say you've lost your sense of humor.david niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he's plunging to his certain and fiery death. (isn't it romantic...) of course, he's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance, and washes up on the beach, just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle. (they immediately clinch).looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts, (so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts, from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies'), the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love. we get it--fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like 'em back, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb...as for the quality of the production, the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing, and the lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad. there are games played with technicolor, (whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that), and foreshadowing, (so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera).the best shots are the early ones on the beach, but, after that, it's all downhill. the (moving like an escalator is moving) staircase is hardly the odessa steps, to say the least, and i'd really caution anyone from feeling like they'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account. the movie overall is bad enough to be funny, and that's about the best thing i can say for it.

i thought hedy burress (who managed to escape from the watery grave of part one) was going to be in part 2 guess not. i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 (you know what i mean).this movie like scream 3, and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie.this was pure crap! the whole movie within a movie crap.bad stay away!

this movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with ed wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in "glen or glenda?"the subject: playing bridge. the park avenue set plays it; the bohemians play it. the russians -- who speak very questionable "russian" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak english -- play it at the restaurant where they work.if one isn't interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.loretta young and paul lukas are fine. (well --frank mchugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as lukas is an unlikely russian.) but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.

bottom of the barrel, unimaginative, and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior. this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far! bad acting, dialog, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences... the list goes on and on. italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. this is the worst by far, no contest. not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half. there was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. but everything else about this movie seriously reeks! for actual post-nuke fun, go track down a copy of endgame, after the fall of new york, or escape from the bronx instead. they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish.

i read tom robbins' even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager. i loved every word. it was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. but when i saw the movie, i could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. how did this happen? i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under "gay pride -- women -- lesbians." (that's the library of congress subject heading.) now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians, any more than star wars is about real space travel. the book was obviously -- and i do mean obviously --written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one.still, someone in hollywood said, "uh oh, better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble." so they handed it to gus van sant. nothing against the man, but -- however gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. gus van sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded lesbian power recruiting poster. it's like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy. not pretty.the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. his clout allowed him to hire the very best. his ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.let's meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues.pat morita as "the chink" okay, there are few name-recognition asian actors. and pat morita, in happy days, was fairly funny. but casting him as the chink was wrong, wrong, wrong. pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man. (gus didn't tell him.) pat also doesn't seem to know that the chink is . . . well, sexy!!! in the book he's not wise old mr. miyagi. he's more like hugh hefner! he's a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean. (you see, in the book, they aren't really lesbians. do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?) john hurt as "the countess." okay, he's a gay friendly man. but he is a serious, shakespearean actor!!!! you need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad. i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more, and sadly shake his head. "now, richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. for shame, my former student!" and yes, john hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as caligula. but that was black humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.rain phoenix as "bonanza jellybean." no talent, no training, no problem. except that in the book bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. in the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. as for her taste for women, robbins in the book puts it like this. "god knows i love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits." uh, gus? did you read this book? uma thurman as "sissy hankshaw." this is a tough role. in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. uma doesn't pull it off, probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. uma plays it more like she's in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia. this movie is sour and dull. and i accuse you, gus van sant!

whack!!! i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it. i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon. he kills his father and friends. about 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school. there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone. read war and peace instead. only ms. hartman did a great job. check out a very young bob saget in this one!!

man, was i disappointed.1) adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from 'friends' 2) a great cast is wasted (kenneth mars, alan arkin, ed mcmahon, pat morita, louis nye) with this amateurish script.3) the movie suffers from horrible pacing. it jumps around through in a jumbled, confusing manner.4) the story doesn't even make sense. why does he want to break the football streak? what about the stupid violin music? none of it is explained.5) it's not even funny. it's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv, saying "lookit me! lookit me i'm being funny!" this was a bad attempt at making another "love at first bite".i like larry cohen movies, but man he failed here. i couldn't wait for the credits to roll. horribly disappointed.

this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater. even though it has nothing whatever to do with king solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh-riot. really! it's worse than "destroy all monsters." be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the shriners have been here), the obviously polyester norfolk jacket on "allan quatermain," david macallum's badly done stutter (which does draw attention away from his even worse acting), the incredibly bad process work on all the "monsters," the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a jr.sr. prom ("voyage into the future with the class of '71"), the phoenician city - where they wear roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and worst of all, macallum and ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! the best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic frenchman ,and the african guy -snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes.

i got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it. it had a 7,8 in imdb (9 votes only) and some external comments were pleasant. but i have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. it starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that i didn't like it very much.you can make a few laughs. and you can see some little tits. but if you like the kind of giallos i like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.i give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. but it could be much better.

if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director, louis malle, i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes, as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979. this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies. considering i didn't know any of these people, it was even less interesting.because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary, i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey? perhaps it was that values aren't as conservative as you might think--this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes (such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine). or, perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town--as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies, anti-black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored.the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed, but when the film makers returned six years later, the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan. this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons. first, the 1979 portion was almost 90% of the film and the final 10% only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne. what about the rest of the folks of this town? did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative? with only a few updates, it seemed suspicious. second, while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years, so did the gross national product. and, while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period, it was far from that, as the period from 1974-1980 featured many shortages (gas, sugar, etc.), strikes, high inflation and general malaise. while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration, the country, in general, was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years. while many in the media demonized reagan (a popular sport in the 80s), the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven. had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn't seemed too negative to be believed (after all, everyone didn't have their lives get worse--this defies common sense), then i might have thought otherwise.overall, not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be--ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985.by the way, is it just me, or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by this film? both are set in similar communities, but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones.

### spoilers! ### what is this movie offering? out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. it is sad to see denzel washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.we are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, american ones. and we know the father is a shady character, he is a mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american. he killed all of them thinking she died. and did she? of course, she won't, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan. the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the "implausibly successful"(as some critic pointed out)'taken'. the nausea of such movies will take time to go. it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for my own private idaho. go figure! mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0

trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan. the frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a great film. the first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he's paid to protect. the trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped. so, i'm giving nothing away when i say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous. rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as creasy tracks down the perpetrators. these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. i'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow. well, he was right. the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap. the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.

don't get me wrong, i love action and revenge flicks, i've seen many of them since i was a kid, including dolph lundgren's latest "the mechanik" which is quite good. and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.but with "man on fire" (and even more then with "domino"), scott shows that rather than using his film-making "genius" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. "man of fire" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making pg-13 movies, i find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a b-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isn't even dead! go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence... thus said...

the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. i am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was way too much. it seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. for a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. that is another disappointing aspect of the movie. if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but i absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.

scary.. yes scary!! jam-packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people), maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in s.a.i first saw this film two years ago - it's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. this film was horrible! hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring down between a girls legs.girl: you're not going to find god in there! guy: nah, but i think i found heaven.steer clear of this one, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting, adultery and the process of superlguing one's genitals together. avoid!

dear me... peter sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been. but his choice of films, say, after 1964, was very unfortunate. he didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. he would have been better off working with more of the kubricks of the film world than the people he did. of his later films, only "the optimists of nine elms" and "being there" have impressed me of those i have seen.that said, the boultings and sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - i have yet to see "carlton browne" and "heavens above!" - at least in the sense of using sellers well to a degree. but, "there's a girl in my soup" really is a poor film and a dire choice on sellers' part in terms of character. in his films from 1955-64, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. here, you have peter sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. it's almost sellers playing a niven cad without the joviality. he certainly does not convince, try as he might, or create an interesting character. he should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as cary grant, and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.hawn and sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by william powell and myrna loy. it is very artificial seeming, all the way through - i know that it is part of danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies, but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. sellers has a very grating way of playing "charm" as well... this character really has no depth, and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty, iconoclastic performance in "lolita".there really is nothing to say about the plot, direction or characters, as frankly they leave little or no impression. this is truly one of the most anaemic, complacent, misguided and lightly dull films i have ever seen. a nonentity of a "vehicle" for sellers' undisputed talents.rating:- * 1/2/*****

peter sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawn's youth (just after her oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. as a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.a 3 out of 10. best performance = ? nicky henson plays a young study type.i hope hawn and sellers were paid well, because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - catch-22, m.a.s.h., husbands, joe, wusa, five easy pieces and many others). you can't win them all!

i love jamie foxx.and i enjoy 99% of all movies i see.and i walked out of this one.now, i admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ("oh no, jamie's knocking on a door! hee hee hee!"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. there could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich-like, but at this point, it's just old and tired. he brought nothing new or interesting. from all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too many "tough guy" lines... and i don't mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. in fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.i love jamie foxx, and i think he's really funny, and i thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. this movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more jamie foxx. i gave it a 2.

i read that "there's a girl in my soup" came out during peter sellers's low period. watching the movie, i'm not surprised. almost nothing happens in the movie. seemingly, the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie; it doesn't. the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything. maybe i haven't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies, but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.all in all, both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on this. pretty worthless.

with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. but what can i say? this was a horrible misfire. the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn. the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it. peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.that song about arabella cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from dr. strangelove and being there throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the magic christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. this one is senseless, and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie. not recommended for anyone.

this movie delivers. the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off.but this movie doesn't stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer. stereotypical grilling dads, several plot lines that go nowhere, and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home.

if you have plenty of time to waste ... it's ok. it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter. the acting is ok. mariana klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable.william r. moses played a pretty good part as the husband.gail o'grady, as the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed.the ending is sort of silly. like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.

i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. the "psycho mom" thing has been done too many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well. the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.one highlight: i am a long-time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular, jon lindstrom.anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable. if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.i'm sorry i spent my time watching it.

this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx, and i bet it will be my last. i failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying "i am going to take a shower".the plot is completely predictable. the bad guy comes after the good guy. the good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. in between, the officials screwing up. the final scenes are utterly unbelievable. you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?there's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done mtv style. don't waste your money on this one.

this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile. after seeing it, my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. this is a good example of a "concept only" film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. this doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. period.the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him--and that is tough considering i am a die-hard python fan. it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). cruella's low self-esteem servant, tim mcinnerny, was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. and it must have cost a few bucks to get gérard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, i am trying to block them out of my mind.overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel.

102 dalmatians [walt disney]: i wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly padded storyline, terrible over acting by glenn close, who hams up every scene as though she's playing for her own amusement, and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors. once more the dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and thats a stretch. another wasted effort here. grade: d

conventional wisdom is that a sequel is seldom as good as the original movie. there are occasional exceptions, but this is not one of them. disney should have quit while they were ahead. this was a real disappointment after a reasonably entertaining 101 dalmatians.

after a day at work, i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started. the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting. all in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.

...that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful, oscar-winning performance. one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx's performance in "ray" was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like "bait" and "booty call," i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar. if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar, i would laugh right in their faces. who knows? maybe he's better off sticking to drama, because if you watch "bait," it's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. i swear, jamie mugs so much in this movie that i'm surprised his face didn't fall off. and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious. if a joke is funny, it's funny. if it's not funny, then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. in real life, normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips. like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in "taxi driver," it's important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian. a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken, and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. if a regular person were being thrown in jail, would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? and wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was? there are many scenes like that throughout the film. another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain, and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent. not funny! not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. giving a comedic performance requires patience, whereas he goes straight to the punchline, whether it's the right time for it or not. i'm not even a big mike epps fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie's. as a matter of fact, this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more low-key approach. one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. however, fellow "green mile" star doug hutchison is disgustingly over-the-top as the villain. a big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in "the green mile," also playing a heavy. antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like "the replacement killers" and "training day." even in "bait," he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx, who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another. unless you're a die-hard fan of foxx, please don't take the bait.

the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i've put the spoiler warning up because i'm unsure if i'm giving anything away. the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. then we're up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house. we're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. some 105 year old woman lived there. there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. an old fashioned straight-razor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it. i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a co-worker and steals the money. his wife is suddenly pregnant. what the hell is going on?? who knows?? nothing is explained. was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? the baby sister? why were iron panels put on the wall? how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed? who is mr. hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? he's never seen again. why was the serial killer killing people? we only see the one old man murdered. was there a pattern or motive or something?? why does the wife suddenly become pregnant? is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen? and why, if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge, burly security guard, is he unable to overpower his wife? and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? and why does the wife stay in the house? is she now possessed by the serial killer? is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back! the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time, but even that couldn't redeem this muddled, incoherent mess.

you'd better choose paul verhoeven's even if you have watched it.

the episodic version of robert heinlein's starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace, following johnny rico leaving his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he lusts for, and joining the mobile infantry. the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film, instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths.throughout watching this version, i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing. the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits, and the aching, prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors, with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving *during* the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes. in terms of construction, it owes a debt to top gun, sharing much in terms of pacing and content (and all that implies).

although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful, the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story.one may believe that middle-class teen-age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30-year-old's they barely know, but i doubt it.one may believe that young high school teens are highly self-confident and self-assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has been, more often than not, teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world.one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin -- the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes -- and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake, but i think not.one may believe that 30-something-year-old troublemakers can enter into, and hang around inside, a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble, but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this.one final nit, throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome. there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene.this movie did not ring true for me.

warning:it contains spoilers. if a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). this one confirms the above lemma. the second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. the fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. and this made more frustrated. to compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. and oh yes, they have lots to show. andy (p.hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, he is cheating his wife, more?, he plans to rob his father, more?, his wife is cheating with his brother, more?, he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death, more?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here... i wonder how could he have a top job. and why his wife didn't leave him before. on the other hand i enjoy much the performances of the actor hoffman.even here psh saves what is left from my 7$ spent for this absurdity. why absurdity? because it doesn't have sense, why should i care for the despicable characters? another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic( at least pleasant) character. also it's a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime.

when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb's views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site i did not enjoy.sidney lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.i like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. mr. lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters.ethan hawke's hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, which he very much is. his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting. ethan hawke plays his character well, but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there.speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad. just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. seriously, that's just about all the character does. her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent.albert finney plays their father charles, and while mr. finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation. for someone who's been an actor as long as mr. finney, you think he'd be more apt at emoting. even though he doesn't show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled. and when he smothers andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to dr. frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery.marisa tomei isn't given much to do with her character. stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. when andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least.and finally we come to andy, played by the always good philip seymour hoffman, is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. his performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who's "perfect crime" of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain, but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother.ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh's great performance and it's family train wreck nature. just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren't.

i know john singleton's a smart guy 'coz he made boyz n the hood, so how did he write and direct this? it's like the pilot of a bad "going away to college for the first time" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition, i guess. who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood? the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo-nazis (and would be roomed-up with a black and a jew - just for laughs!) even laurence fishburne's creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot. except busta rhymes, of course. big ups.

based on the personal experiences of director john singleton's time at the university of southern california,comes higher learning. a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story: malik williams, an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male. kristin conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and remy, a unsophisticated unconnected white male. all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared (malik), by being naive (kristin), and by being unwanted (remy).one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large. the colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students. it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.but it didn't and that's where the films falls apart. singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at southern california. through this film he lets it all hang out. there is no need to beat around the bush here. singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student.who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her? the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence? the performances of omar epps (malik) and kristy swanson (kristin) are disappointing. they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie (tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable). o'shea jackson aka ice cube ,busta rhymes, and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles. and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor. only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film.john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film. and he did so quite badly. it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun. life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this. higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. seeing the film ,then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to. not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest.

i haven't read a single imdb comment for this movie that mentions how the jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a little baby as a gun is pointed in his face by a racist skinhead while the movie's lead black character looked in sternness down the barrel of a gun.i don't know how anyone could perceive this as a balanced account of university life. i agree universities are not bastions of tolerance like they are supposed to be and the title would be fitting if singleton didn't make his characters such broad caricatures.on the surface he tries to portray ice cube's character as a bad guy, provoking remy to become a racist skinhead. but who graduates at the end in the movie's redeeming epilogue? it seems singleton points at white as either unable to empathize (i didn't say sympathize!) with his fellow black student or only able to take the path of a racist skinhead. many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry.nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle. quite honestly what was the point?

despite, or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters, stereotypes are in, and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not-too-subtle cinematic screed.one gets the sense that john singleton was dabbling in post-structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day, and "higher learning" was the tendentious result. the low point of the movie is the "peace" rally, in which the symbols of the 1960s "free love" movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a "take back the night" rally with live, stridently identity-conscious musical acts in tow. perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new vietnam? ooh, how adrienne rich of himand remy's firing into the crowd is a nice touch, if you're into rich's sort of political posturing.i wish i could give this movie negative stars. i can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race, class, and gender to popular culture and declared man-hating "a viable and honorable political option". where's camille paglia when you need her?

first of all yes i'm white, so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race... anyway... white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok (because apparently we deserved it!!). where do i start? i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co. get in a fight with some really big, really strong, really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win!!! the neo-nazi where twice the size :), and the chase! the chase is priceless... this is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it doesn't deliver... this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes, the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead...cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it.save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written ,poorly acted, dull and clearly biased picture, if you are into the subject, go and rent american history x, now thats a movie

singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with. i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart; however, this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous. in addition, there are a bunch of "might-makes-right" messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up. i mean, who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks? however, he way singleton portrays the "fight" is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else. there is another "bad guy" (in reality a drunken frat boy) who rapes one of the movie's protagonists. in this instance, i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one. in any event, he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape. well, no means no, this is a rape, which probably occurs a lot in universities across the country.having established the rape, how does singleton deal with it? when the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone, at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a "black bitch." the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube, et al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged "apologies" to roommate for his racist remarks; however the (apparently in singleton's mind) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned. again, no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy; however, singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks.what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton, while no doubt a talented director, does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude.

minor spoilers!well i just sat up late and watched this film, mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of singleton's earlier work like "boyz n the hood". however, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clichéd, so-called "message" movies. the acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. by the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. as a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. it's message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. as for the films conclusion i found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. for a film called "higher learning" i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.if you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire "american history x"....unless you were just watching it for tyra banks then go hire a life.

i don't understand why people would praise this garbage. its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else. the film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in college. this is where it fails. it has no grasps on reality. from many questionable non-sense scenes in the movie such as for examplea black man chasing down a white man with a gun, the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them.the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards.as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymesanother critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters. from the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. its almost as its an insult to both black and white people. i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters. one a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film. they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education. which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out. in which after they go back to their boring lives and think "being white is bad". does this sound alot like your college years? didn't think so. i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess.overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie. if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x. if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys. just avoid this mess.

higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors. most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages. stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race. incompetent acting, direction, and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick. an appalling piece of trash. the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed. higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors. most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages. stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race. incompetent acting, direction, and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick. an appalling piece of trash. the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed.

yes, people are racist. people are even racist in college. that's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it's in college too.this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. the angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads "dead men don't rape." see what i mean?) i don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-nazis will act like violent neo-nazis. i'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens.another problem i have with this movie is that it's supposed to be "gritty" and "hard-hitting," but they make nazis the bad guys. i agree nazis are evil, but that's my point. everybody thinks nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's. the film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.higher learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid. avoid at all costs.

this is one of the most putrid movies of the 90's. i would not recommend it if you have something better to do. this picture presents african-americans as savage, uncultured, violent, inarticulate, reefer-smoking sociopaths. fudge(ice cube) and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm, not just the white people, but asians too, and are never disciplined for their actions. despite all that tolerance they keep on whining and crying about the evil white oppressors who run their lives and stand in their way. in fact it is fudge's influence that causes remmy to bond with the skin heads, to drop out of college, and eventually to kill malik's girlfriend.the skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. they never blast their music to annoy people nor do they taunt the police. they do commit serious crime such as battery and rape, yet they're not as repulsive nor as threatening as fudge and dreads(busta rhymes) are.there's a lot of material in this film which almost offended me or made me giggle. some of it is as follows below.fudge and dreads are stated as students at the columbus university yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition. one is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. though they are students at what looks like a private university, they cannot utter a single line of proper english. their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia.it appears that drunken kristen(kristy swanson) knew exactly why drunken billy was taking her to his house. she even asked him to get a rubber so that they could begin. the fact that he penetrated her without a condom became a rape whilst it would be great sex only if he had one handy. later kristen was assured by taryn(jennifer connely) that she holds no accountability in that matter, and despite willfully jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of by a sexual predator. then a week or so later she met, and slept with, an ultra-sensitive do-gooder who knew how to avoid raping and brought a condom. the director stressed contraception thoroughly.this movie is complete and utter garbage that makes black people look like pricks and women look stupid and frail. cole hauser's acting, and laurence fishburne's accent are the only reasons i can think of to watch it. the writer/director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. go ahead and limit your own by watching this crap if you want, but keep in mind that neurons don't grow back. just follow the advice at the end and unlearn.

this is the least scary film i have ever seen. how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film. the blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape it. the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten. if you havent seen this film i recommend you do, its far too funny to be taken seriously.

when a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight. the only part of this senseless drivel that i enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. this dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese. this thing actually made 20 million bucks? and mcqueen's salary was 3k? all were vastly overpaid. the 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen-age years. and those blasts from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor. the ending was pitifully trite; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel....and there were many. thumbs down.

the blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever, sung by an uncredited burt bacharach of all people! you really have to hear it to believe it, the blob may be worth watching just for this song alone & my user comment summary is just a little taste of the classy lyrics... after this unnerving opening credits sequence the blob introduces us, the viewer that is, to steve andrews (steve mcqueen as steven mcqueen) & his girlfriend jane martin (aneta corsaut) who are parked on their own somewhere & witness what looks like a meteorite falling to earth in nearby woods. an old man (olin howland as olin howlin) who lives in a cabin also sees it & goes to investigate, he finds a crater & a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick. laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick, if you know what i mean! it then slides up the stick & attachés itself to the old man's hand. meanwhile steve & jane are quietly driving along minding their own business when the old man runs out in front of steve's car, steve being a decent kinda guy decides to take the old man to dr. t. hallan (alden 'stephen' chase as steven chase) at the local surgery. dr. hallan says he doesn't know what the substance on the old man's hand is but it's getting bigger & asks steve to go back where he found him & see if he can find out what happened. steve agrees but doesn't come up with anything & upon returning to dr. hallan's surgery he witnesses the blob devouring him. the town's police, lieutenant dave (earl rowe) & the teenage hating sergeant jim bert (john benson) unsurprisingly don't believe a word of it & end up suspecting steve & his mates al (anthony franke), tony (robert fields) & someone called 'mooch' miller (james bonnet) of playing an elaborate practical joke on the police department. however as the blob continues to eat it's way through the town steve sets about finding proof of it's existence & convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world!directed irvin s. yeaworth jr. & an uncredited russell s. doughton jr. i was throughly disappointed by this, the original 1958 version of the blob. the script by kay linaker as kate phillips & theodore simonson is an absolute bore & extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects. the blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics & conflicts between the teenagers & police, in fact the majority of the blob is spent on steve trying to convince the police of the blob's existence. for most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential & somewhat forgotten. it only has two or three scenes for the fist hour & a bit until the less than exciting climax when the adults & teenagers have to work together to defeat the blob & have a new found appreciation of each other afterwards, yuck! why couldn't the blob just eat the lot of 'em? no explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space, how long did it take them to come up with that? the dialogue is clunky & silly as well, as are people's actions & decision making, i love the part when a nurse named kate (lee paton as lee payton, did anyone use their real name in this thing?) is confronted by the blob, she throws some acid over it & calmly proclaims "doctor, nothing will stop it!", how does she know 'nothing' will stop it exactly? there's no blood or violence so don't worry about that, the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time & moves very slowly, a bit like the film in general actually. the acting is terrible, mcqueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old & it shows, he looks old enough to be his own dad! same thing goes for most of the other 'teenage' cast members & everyone generally speaking are wooden & unconvincing in their roles. technically the blob is very basic, dark static photography, dull direction & forgettable production values. the blob is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper & is well known as being a 'classic' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen. this is one case when the remake the blob (1988) is definitely better than the original. the original blob is slow & boring & the remake isn't, the original blob contains no blood or gore & the remake does, the original blob has incredibly poor acting & casting decisions & the remake doesn't & the original blob itself gets very little screen time eating only three or four people throughout the entire film & the remake features the blob all the way through & it virtually eats an entire town. the choice is an easy one, the remake every time as it's a better film in every respect. i'll give the film two stars & give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own. definitely not the classic many seem to make out.

i'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites. while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. it's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. i have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.there are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue. it was fun to see steve m. and anita c. together, but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?

for the big thinkers among us, "the intruder" is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives so-called "art films" a bad name. the story is something about a bitter old coot, louis trebor (michel subor), who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing. with no coherent storyline to boast of, the movie loses us early on, though i'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film. this muddled, snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits.

claire denis's movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. "l'intrus" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not so awful as "trouble every day" or "j'ai pas sommeil."now, ever since i saw "chocolat," i've made it a point to see every new movie denis makes. and i have always been disappointed. "l'intrus" was no exception. she has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. you get a lot of the denis regulars: an older but still magnificent béatrice dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips, the gap between her teeth, her ample cleavage, and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from "trouble every day" and "j'ai pas sommeil," grégoire colin, and that lithuanian or russian girl. michel subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera lingered on him at such length that i got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in korea, i think, he finally got it cut. there was certainly some action--gruesome murders, a man's search for a son--and there may even have been a plot, but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out, and two viewings are, i fear, out of the question. for one thing, the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in "beau travail"). for another, the seasons changed too abruptly, leaving you even more confused about what was going on. oh, there were a few pretty shots, and if you liked "friday evening" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "l'intrus." otherwise, steer clear. i saw this movie in french and it's possible i missed something crucial. but the dialogue in a denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with ample margins. in "chocolat" the silence is sublime; in "l'intrus," it's just dull.

i would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand i was fully able to understand it for what it is.. a very incoherent attempt at a plot line.i don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well. the director firstly presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" way and worse, extremely incoherently. it is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged order, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to care by the end of it.i respect surrealist cinema for what it is. (creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) but there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern times, and a modern day earth setting, that is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermore, simply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together. the most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book, but being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.let's compare stylistic cinema. compare gaspar noe's "seul contre tous" to this. he gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. this movie offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.yes indeed it is possible to make sense of things.... to a point. but as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say "who cares." it plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order. even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish, and in every way this film tries to make the viewer look foolish.if you have too much time on your hands, then please watch this film, taking into account what i have said of it. it is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.

chesty gringo telly savalas (as frank cooper) is a us-mexico "border cop". he serves as a father figure to young immigrant danny de la paz (as benny romero), who wants mr. savalas to be best man at his impending wedding. savalas is tough, but boss eddie albert (as commander moffat) may be tougher. tough is what you need to stop smuggler michael v. gazzo (as chico suarez). alliances may be in flux.if you find the possibility of hearing "kojak" and "oliver douglas" uttering expletives to be repulsive, you ought to steer clear of "the border". if not, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" cow slaughtering scene. although it doesn't end up being worth much, mr. de la paz and cecilia camacho (as leina) steal the show. ** the border (1979) tony richardson ~ telly savalas, danny de la paz, eddie albert

considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is. even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon, lanchester, kovacs and gingold? - the entire event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, witless.kim novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid. james stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey. i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does. except maybe the cat.

this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. what she does do however, is shine when she's on screen. the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day. jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star. ruth roman handles the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb. better if this was in color. the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well. what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes. if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one.

it's nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman's ordered us forces into the korean war. starlift, you see, is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea. but you'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name 'korea' mentioned. we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america's men in uniform. released in december 1951 by warner brothers, starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio's star-studded world war two home-front morale booster "hollywood canteen." this 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie. but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract, from joan crawford, john garfield, and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre, bette davis, sydney greenstreet and more. starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne (a mask-like janice rule) and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. but in place of crawford, garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day, ruth roman, gordon macrae, virginia mayo, gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney, randolph scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper. this threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. how bad is it? you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! to describe starlift as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy, lazy and third rate. it's just terrible. avoid it.

actress ruth roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump-started this all-star warner bros. salute to patriotism and song. many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal (ron hagerthy, who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle). seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew, flying to and from honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way, but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies). doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant. roman is also here, looking glamorous, while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone. jane wyman sings, too, in a hospital bedside reprise following doris day's lead, causing one to wonder, "did they run out of sets?" for undemanding viewers, an interesting flashback to another time and place. still, the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render "starlift" strictly a second-biller. *1/2 from ****

whoa boy.ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him? well they exist, in many forms. but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone's praises about how much of an artistic "genius" he is? well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene (i know they're everywhere and i don't even follow the local scene), or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe.the premise is good and, honestly, it's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary. we are made to follow two bands, the brian jamestown massacre, lead by anton, and the dandy warhols, lead by courtney. i've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie... not so the brian jamestown massacre. why? well from this documentary's perspective, because the brian jamestown massacre's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry. however, instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed, the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity.because, see, anton is a "genius." because he plays rock music. he really "understands the evolution of music"... because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments. his music is considered "post-modern retro but the future"... because it's rock music. he wants to bring out a "revolution"... through rock music. okay so let's face it... twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i'd care to watch a documentary about.the documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to showcasing any of anton's talent, because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that. so instead we watch anton, "the genius", the socio-maniacal loser, be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music. whether he did or not i won't know, because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it. what i do know is that then we're left with a story about some self-centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up. why even bother watching that? people like anton don't deserve the attention they seek, the hope and admiration of all those different people, and especially a post-failure paean to lost potential. this movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut vh1 special for a reason: he goes on and on about the music, but it's all about the image and the attention. look at the guy, look at how he dresses, look at how he acts, look at how he tries to create controversy because he can't afford marketing.honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel, and that's because of anyone in this documentary, joel is the only person who seems to have any fun. maybe it's because he's the tambourine man. the rest of them are all "rock stars"! they deserve our attention, and admiration, and interest, and engagements! they are out there to "save rock and roll." do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to "save rock and roll"? yeah, that was because of anton, and it's "selfish of them not to mention me (anton) as an inspiration." what a load. people like anton are best left forgotten. this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull--because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless. thanks a lot, anton. your antics ruined music for everyone you touched, whatever the opinion to the contrary is. and if people "in the know" about anton disagree and he really was a genius, it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way.--polarisdib

truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen....ever.they tried to make up for it by giving it the, 'we know we are doing this' routine. that would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'the simpsons' had already done it. and it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's (mainly j.d's) fantasies. the flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred, just compilations of say, j.d falling over or, i don't know.... elliott falling over. if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to, and it disappoints me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. i was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit-com.and just as a passing thought, why the hell was dr.cox bald?

when 'my deja vu, my deja vu' aired last season, i was pleased. scrubs, i thought, is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept. instead of replaying footage, they're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner, and i really enjoyed it.i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong. one season later, they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show...and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid. dr cox's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together, as it doesn't appear again until 'my long goodbye' some 4 episodes later. i can't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom. who knows why it was slotted there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of episodes that have aired within the past year.three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television.

i debated as to whether or not i should tick the spoiler box. since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of scrubs it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler.clip shows. grrr. we all knew friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows...and five and a half years into scrubs they've gone and fallen down that hole.i have to wonder if the writers just couldn't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves "let's show the other funny stuff." it didn't work.for starters, showing all the times that people have fallen down isn't funny when taken out of context. it's not funny to see todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know why he was dangling by his banana hammock.second, for what was supposed to be a compilation of jd's fantasies, one was turk's dream, another also wasn't his fantasy, although i forget which.and that's the problem. this episode is totally forgettable. we've seen all these things before. and the collection of clips of people dancing? why? that's not funny.finally, i must admit two of my favourite scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation...dr. cox realising that ben died...and jd telling him how proud of him he is.but even seeing those moments again didn't save the episode. the summary says it all.worst episode ever. bill lawrence, please don't let your show go the same way as friends, keep it fresh, keep it funny...or wrap it up.

but, lets face it... it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me.the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups. i get a new season, and just power through them like i have 2-days to live. i like the idea of wrapping it up, but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following:dr.cox isn't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes, only explanation i can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning.and that my friends, is why the hell cox is bald.anyways, the show is awesome...bring on the 7th season.

i thought it was not the best re-cap episode i've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the brendan fraser moment...*sigh*). it was nice to see cox outside of the incessantly brittle "coxism state" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of jd) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. i can also see how zach might be well on the way to a very chevy chase/or is that matthew perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on conan). a little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was "diner" by martin sexton.

the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr. cox was bald. although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, dr. cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. the latest episode when our favorite grumpy, jesus-loving nurse roberts dies dr. cox shaves his head. the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. for shame, scrubs. they've made mistakes like this before. i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. i try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it up.

there are no spoilers in this review. there's nothing to spoil.no plot, nothing; most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch, but this didn't even do that. clips, three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips... ok, so perhaps they were short on production time, but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely. what a waste of time.i'm not sure how this got made, in fact. scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes, but somehow this got through....thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode.

trash/bad movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable. this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it - its below "bad". there is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie. needless to say, the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film. one tagliner compares this one to killbill which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this dvd.if you are considering renting this one, put it down! if you are thinking of buying, dont think! if you unlucky to have this dvd, dont play it, throw it in trash bin immediately.

i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget. bad acting, horrible cinematography, and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. the wwf style cinemtography will make you cry...where's the tripod?! the filmakers aimed high, but sorely missed their mark.

i still don't know why i forced myself to sit through the whole thing. this "film" wasn't worth the memorex dvd-r it was burned on; i thought i was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder. this is by far the worst movie ever made. i truly, from the bottom of my heart, want to sue aaron yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life.so apparently, it's supposed to be bad on purpose; however, if you should end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo, you'll see that yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. the actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to crimson tide but come closer to the marine.the crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. the camera angles are awful. the story is c-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered b-movie caliber. the dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty, but is crap like everything else. rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. plus, the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno, but because it's non-stop. that's right, the music plays in the background the whole time, acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. i don't care what the disclaimer claims, i don't buy it. bots was not made this bad on purpose, because it takes itself way too serious for what it was: a joke.this "film" was very low-budget. but that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. great films are born of substance, not budget. bots had neither.allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if i were having a three-way with jessica alba and jessica biel in front of a tv and blood of the samurai came on, i'd be out of there quicker than steven seagal in executive decision.undoubtedly, some people will try to defend the movie. two, maybe three. they'll say, "it's grindhouse chop-socky!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" those people are idiots. a movie is either good, or it's bad. there's no such thing as a good bad movie. but there are such things as idiots that like crappy movies. don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. slither is one. bots is not.this suckfest runs about an hour and a half, and in my humble opinion, it's 90 minutes too long. the best thing about this "film" is the dvd cover, so next time you're near the wal-mart dvd bargain bin, take a look at it-- don't touch it, just look-- and quietly walk away.

spoiler!! i love branagh, love helena bonham-carter, loved them together in "mary shelley's frankenstein" - but this -i can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. well, they did, but really - the script droned on, bonham-carter's clothes were tres chic, and the occasional speeded-up "madcap" sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie, or the old rowan and martin laugh-in.i never got the point - other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer. i never felt that. he was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. certainly not amusing.bonham-carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in "full monty."the poetic ending, with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated. was there a choir of angels, or merely a soundtrack?go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it. donate this to pbs.

i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing. my first reaction was, 'oh god not again!'. it's so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable. for some reason, though, i stayed and watched it 'til the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping they'd give me something to cheer about.and surely, ken and helena can act. also, the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point.helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character. jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity. then again she has a soft side that's just looking for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character...this was a triumph of acting, the movie itself is nothing unique.see if you are an acting student...if you're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. it's sean penn serious! oh my, that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokes...not for escapists though.

i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching. i watched it with a room full of kids, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor. the director, bob dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with. this is not a good film for kids! besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. what a waste of a perfectly good story. if you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry. buy your kids the book instead.

i was bored, around 10pm, so i watched this movie. and i could not stop laughing. everything was so ridiculous. the way the kids were acting like they were older than 11 just cracked me up. one of the kids had a ring, that supposedly killed people after 3 or so years. it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster.it's pretty hard to take little kids seriously, especially when it has to do with eating worms. they act like everything is such a big deal, like if billy (the main character) doesn't eat the worms then the world will end.this is a good movie for little kids (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says 'penis'), but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time.

squeamish 11-year-old luke benward (as billy "worm boy" forrester) moves to a new town. at his new school, young benward is picked on by the other boys. they put worms in his thermos. getting his gag reflex under control, benward tosses a worm on freckle-faced bully adam hicks (as joe guire). benward bets he can eat 10 worms in one day - without regurgitation! tall, teased hallie kate eisenberg (as erika "erk" tansy) uses her archery skills to help benward. director and former sctv writer bob dolman promises, "no worms were harmed in the making of this movie." in a related note, sctv star andrea martin has one funny scene. "how to eat fried worms" is loosely based on thomas rockwell's popular novel. pre-teen kids into gross-outs should enjoy the film.**** how to eat fried worms (8/25/06) bob dolman ~ luke benward, adam hicks, hallie kate eisenberg, alexander gould

i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as i didn't think it was going to be well done. the kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so i caved. i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. the movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the "silly" or "stupid" choices.

i knew it would be, but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun. anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that i'm pretty easy to please. i really didn't think i'd end up feeling this negatively towards it.the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can become one with a good dragon or something i don't know. it was so stupid, i didn't bother to put much effort into retaining it.it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts. so many of the events just felt totally random and sudden.i assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's trying to be so grand and epic, yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly. i feel like i've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball. the film is like a punch in the face. it doesn't take much time at all to establish characters or drama. imagine the "lord of the rings" trilogy in 90 minutes you could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no buildup and you'd hardly care about the outcome of those battles. that was the case with dragon wars 90 minutes of me not giving a crap, waiting for it to be over.fantastic cgi with some okay directing, but horrible acting, speedy pacing, and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds. i probably would have loved it when i was 6.

if i had realized john wayne was in this movie, i would not have watched it. it's demeaning to the japanese, unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person. but then, most john wayne movies are like that. hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was (and still is) somewhat different. the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan. maybe it's hollywood that should be isolated.to put it as succinctly as possible, this film is appalling jingoistic claptrap.(sort of a madama butterfly with bad music.)

there are often badly-matched couples (in the general sense of the term) -in huston's movies :"african queen" "heaven knows mister allison" "roots of heaven" "misfits" ..."the barbarian and the geisha" (check the title) is another good example,so to speak.it seems that japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as "sayonara" " the world of suzie wong" and "the teahouse of the august moon" bear witness. huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of "susie " maybe).john wayne perfectly fits in ford's world ,in huston's he's like a bull in a china shop.his japanese partner is totally bland.even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.only those utterly enamoured of huston's every work need to choose this ,among all his other great movies around.

this is is a thoroughly unpleasant, if slickly made, movie. i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. the movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. what we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can. burt reynolds does a cameo. the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop, but i somehow missed them (good move on their part). the whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, i suspect, to the style of 'pulp fiction', 'fargo' and 'natural born killers'. if you liked those, you'll probably like this.

vic (richard dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. how can a director have a cast with richard dreyfuss, ellen barkin, jeff goldblum, diane lane (very gorgeous), gabriel byrne, gregory hines, kyle maclachlan, burt reynolds, billy idol and a make such a waste of time? this movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. my vote is four.title (brazil):' prazer em matar-te!' ('pleasure in killing you!')

dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's "fixed." lane is his girl who's been messing around with his number one (goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with lane's sister (barkin).with what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (burt reynolds, gabriel byrne, kyle maclachlan and even an appearance by richard pryor) can't help this plot, as dreyfuss proves he's not "fixed" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight.you know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. the first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell goldblum what was in store for him when dreyfuss gets out, but i'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie.the actual reason i picked this movie is because i've been on a diane lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. the real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film. the parts where the suspense was supposed to mount found me laughing at what was actually going on.3 out of 10 stars.

"mad dog time"..."trigger happy" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like gangster comedies ( as i thought oscar , johney dangerously and mafia also sucked ) it's probably more "witty sharp wordplay" than all out comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )make it out to be. the rick , mick , vic thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. there wasn't enough changes of location or feel for the period they were supposed to be in. the majority of the film was either set in "dreyfus's club" or a variety of offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that sit down gun stand off thing goldblum kept winning ?) the supporting cast was... on paper excellent ( great to see silva & drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and richard pryors cameo was a joke ! the romance and love element of the film also bogged it down.4/10 i don't think i'll return to it anytime soon.

so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert's book "i hated, hated, hated this movie" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review "mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor". so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert's review of rob reiner's "north" where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don't think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. but above all the other things that were awful about this "movie" i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss's girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill. haha. not funny. then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra's "my way" sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss. of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die. are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny. not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss (who i admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that "independence day" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. did goldblum feel that "independence day" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if "independence day" were a bomb? what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? the opening sequence of "mad dog time" says that the movie is set on another planet. i only wish now that i have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that i will never get back. ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid. every copy of "mad dog time" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.

wowwwwww, about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie!!! i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. or at least have some redeeming qualities, like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie, or like really intelligent, or very well filmed or something...needless to say, that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life. im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilers"...imdb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that. i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie... im still a big imdb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.

seriously what the hell was this movie about,,simply stupid,,i'd give it 0 but,,,1"awful" is the lowest you can go,,seriously this movie is not worth watching,,waste of time, i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10,,i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people,,'n i promise i'll make a movie better than this,,this movie was so bad,,that i'll never watch a movie starring steve carrel again,bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it,,i'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second

i have a 5 minute rule (sometimes i'll leave leway for 10). if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. dan in real life is definitely no exception. i was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and i don't like any of the characters at all.the story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. i suppose the tagline would be "advice columnist who could use advice"? i don't know. dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. i guess that's the irony? i don't know. he goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. the central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her. anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her, but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network dialogue "murderer of love" to get to the inevitable happy ending.this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen.

the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.i have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night - dan in real life. steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.the dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter walton's family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film.

spoiler: bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion. the script has them saying and doing things people would never do, at least anyone with a shred of decency. the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion, unaware she will show up as his brother's girlfriend at the reunion. he tries to defer to his brother's claim, but she, knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her, teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper, rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch. at one point, she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him. he tries to cover his eyes. his heart is breaking. she thinks it's funny, until she suddenly decides she doesn't want the brother and leaves the reunion.the movie really drags. the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul. the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable. we almost walked out, but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up, but nooooo. all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills, out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this. comparing it to little miss sunshine??? jeez. shame on them, the writers, the actors, the producers, and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen!

oh dear. this movie could have been sub-titled "when writers go on strike!" what a stinker. i had really high hopes for this, mostly after reading imdb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system, but that's a separate matter. i loved steve carrell in anchorman, bruce almighty, the office, etc so i was expecting great things. to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year. there are so many things wrong with this movie, but i'll confine myself to (a) the implausibility of any family behaving like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? what planet is that real life on?), the clunky script (a murderer of love? please), and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? this movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous set-scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents, who don't get out much and don't like to waste money. unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining. if you like movies, avoid this like the plague.

if, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a life advice column, is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself, then there is probably something wrong with you. the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) there's almost no chemistry between the leads, and steve carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. it's hard to believe binoche's character would have any interest in him. then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. isn't that great america!

expectations were somewhat high for me when i went to see this movie, after all i thought steve carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like anchorman, the 40 year-old virgin, and little miss sunshine. boy, was i wrong.i'll start with what is right with this movie: at certain points steve carell is allowed to be steve carell. there are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing. he's an undoubtedly talented individual, and it's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train-wreck.with that out of the way, i'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong.the film begins with dan burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column. he prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other.the family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie. no family behaves like this. it's almost as if they've been transported from pleasantville or leave it to beaver. they are a caricature of what we think a family is when we're 7. it reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating. touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling, and talent shows are not how actual people behave. it's almost sickening.another big flaw is the woman carell is supposed to be falling for. observing her in her first scene with steve carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. what i imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded.it makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet. i left the theater wondering what i just saw. after thinking further, i don't think it was much.

-might contain spoilers... but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish.i walked into this movie with high expectations. it was my own fault. i had put too much stock in steve carell's record to date. 40 year old virgin... little miss sunshine... the office. and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. it's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately. the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching "blue steel" in 1990.this flick fumbled from start to finish. the script was flunky material. awful writing all around. "murderer of love"? "love is an ability"? whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty's writer(s)... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard. the entire flick was peppered with three's company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene. or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene. or the awful laundry room scene. right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments. and it happens over and over and over again.and what's with carell's character? the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? let's face it. their conversation sucked. they both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes. pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie.... carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (i think the exact line was "this one time when i was a kid"... that's it. seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses. the actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing.back to the imdb thing... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. i know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio. check out the family stone's rating... if that's a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2... and that's pushing it.

what of domino did i hate over everything, and i mean everything, else? perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. maybe it's the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like kiera knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. it is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. the principal question is: 'was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy?' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' but really, she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school, attempting to impress her peers. there are things you genuinely don't know how to react to, whether they're supposed to be funny or not. if it is supposed to be a comedy, that begs the next question: 'is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs?' i don't think so.the film opens with the title card 'based on a true story........sort of.' if that's supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose, then you're simply on another planet. truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer. following this, we learn of domino's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the 'sort of' cop out as in real life she was just four. but if the film had gone by reality's dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of........her goldfish.we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey (rourke); domino (knightley) herself and would-be love interest choco (ramírez). during the scene, an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared. what a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers, fire off weapons at innocents we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of 'no, why are you doing this? why is this happening?' bad seeds are planted and, wouldn't you know it, they stick. the film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210. here is another daft post-modernist slant, people playing themselves and that 'sort of' joker card being played again. christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr's natural born killers character.so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco's gang, purely for her good looks i might add, it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver's registration i.ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another. the problem is, as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? if there is any 'feeling' between choco and domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included.so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise. we find out the reason for the fake i.ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble. the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded? he must've swam really quickly  double the speed of the film's fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second. yeah, sure. the film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. plus, there's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film's comedy runs so dry, that it has to resort to the "jerry, jerry!" chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show. when did we last laugh at "jerry! jerry!"? when we were, say, seven years old? i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence.

this was another obscure christmas-related title, a low-budget mexican production from exploitation film-maker cardona (night of the bloody apes [1969], tintorera! [1977]), which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the u.s. by k. gordon murray. judging by those two efforts already mentioned, cardona was no visionary  and, this one having already received its share of flak over here, is certainly no better! the film, in fact, is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era, but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color (which, in view of the prominence of reds  apart from st. nick himself, the devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout, was essential). anyway, in a nutshell, the plot involves satan's efforts to stall santa claus' christmas eve rendezvous with the earth's children; there is, however, plenty more wackiness along the way: to begin with, our portly, white-bearded and chronically merry man-in-red lives in a celestial palace who, apart from accompanying toy-maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing (laboriously for the whole first reel!) in their native tongue, visits merlin  the famed magician at king arthur's court, here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child-like hopping and mumbling gibberish!  once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible (by the way, the wizard's anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr. frankenstein in son of dracula [1974]!!); incidentally, by this time, he always seems to have gained some excess weightso santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney! the devil's antics (enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up) to hold up st. nick's delivery program, then, is perfectly puerile: indeed, their tit-for-tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel & hardy routine more than anything! to pad out the running-time, we focus on three sets of children: one, the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company (projected as a wish-fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra-large packages!), a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own (the horned one first tempts her to steal one, then invades the little one's dreams  to no avail) and a trio of brats who, egged on once again by satan, think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves. there is definitely imagination at work here, but it is applied with little rhyme or reason, while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment (unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure) well at bay!

this santa movie starts off strange and i think santa might be a pedo. instead of the usual elf toy makers, this santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from "it's a small world"! i guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives (it's apparently not the north pole and not on earth)!! none of these kids seem very happy and i kept wanting to see commandos break in and rescue the tykes, though i guess for some of the third world kids, these working conditions were perhaps an improvement over local sweatshops. i sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys.then, the scene abruptly changes to hell where lots and lots of demons dance about like they are in a busby berkeley musical. this fun in put to a stop by satan who orders one of them, pitch, to go to earth to ruin christmas!! personally, i thought this movie already did that! the devil and his imps are actually kind of cute--like hot stuff from the harvey comics but with cool evil goatees! or, if you are puerto rican, like a vejigante mask with a goatee! somehow a poverty-stricken mexican kid named lupita, a group of jerky kids who want to mug santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the devil and santa!! so, if the prince of darkness (not donald trump, it's the other prince of darkness) can somehow make her steal and be bad, he'll 'win'--what, we don't really know! in fact, as they root her on, you get the impression that the film makers intend santa to be jesus--as he has all these great powers and fights the devil over kids' souls! later, santa meets with his friend, merlin. he asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams. considering how much santa laughs in the film (like a demented chipmunk), i assume he must use this drug a lot! he immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens all doors. considering he keeps kids as his personal 'assistants', this magic key thing worries me immensely! during santa's christmas eve ride, you see lupita behave like a little angel--one problem down. santa then takes time out now to take care of the rich kid whose parents are selfish jerks. he gives them some sort of crazy cocktail which magically solves their problems--two problems solved. this is a rare case where alcohol/drugs help kids and solves problems! and as for the little muggers, he gives them coal! frustrated with his losses to santa, pitch then tries to steal the sleigh (which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer). when this fails, he destroys santa's stash of 'magic powder'! as a result, santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets treed. uh, oh...how can santa take a detour to the betty ford clinic if he's stuck up a tree?! will st. nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win? if you care, tune in and see. however, be warned that the film is bat-crap crazy! technically speaking, the film is yecchy. while it is in color, it's really gaudy. the music is mostly done on an organ--which, along with bad singing from the kids, produces perhaps the worst soundtrack i've heard in recent memory. and the story is just incomprehensible and very, very, very creepy. devils and a santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep-tastic. it's a film you should never show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish!

wow. who ever said that edward d. wood jr. never influenced anybody? this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point; it makes "the violent years" look like "casablanca"! "santa claus" also makes keith richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission. i've had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being. however, i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well. also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa-satan dichotomy on vhs tape, look no further. don't check out this movie, as i've been notified the mst3k version is now available. move over satan, here's "santa claus".

the nsa, cia, fbi, fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people. (as mst3k commentary states it..."sanata has the dirt on every! santa's tentacles reach far and wide! there is no hiding from the klaus organization")from telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything. its amazing that the cia doesn't have santa on the payroll. satan's dance routine is hilarious. pitch...he is so useless.the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous. very low budget but so fun to watch. i recommend watching the mystery science theatre 3000 version for even more laughs.you even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids.i give this a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.

its hard to make heads or tails of this film. unless you're well oiled and in the mood to mock, don't view santa claus. it mixes santa, satan, merlin, and moralizing in a most unappetizing way. it certainly is not for fretful children.

before i'd seen this, i had seen some pretty bad christmas films. but once i saw this, "jingle all the way" looked better than "the godfather". "santa claus" is a jolly film about santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it. santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that i'm sure has turned many kids off of christmas. the plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits along with all of the performances and dialog. santa lives high above earth in the north pole where he, and kids from all around the world get ready for christmas. but santa has an enemy named pitch, or satan. pitch tries to ruin santa's christmas by making three boys naughty, and by creating diversions, like moving the chimney and making the doorknob hot. when pitch causes santa to be attacked by a dog, it's up to santa's helper pedro and merlin the wizard to get santa out of this pickle. everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than santa. santa talks about delivering presents to all the boys and girls, yet he seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in mexico. the reindeer are wind up toys, and when the reindeer laughs, i'm amazed it doesn't bring tears to kid's eyes...it's frightening. everything is terrible. the first 10 minutes are simply santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. probably one of the strangest scenes is santa shooting pitch in the butt with a mini-cannon and uproariously laughing about it while pitch dances around in pain. i think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from, than showing them this. the only positive is it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate bad cinema.my rating: bomb/****. 85 mins.

while "santa claus conquers the martians" is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made, this mexican-made film from 1959 is so bad it makes "sccm" look like "it's a wonderful life." you have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking; perhaps they meant it as a third-world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. nah . . . they just weren't very good. the same production company made an even more disturbing version of "little red riding hood" in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (perhaps this was the inspiration for "freeway.") back to "santa claus": instead of the north pole, jolly old saint nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit (shades of "mst3k"); instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice. the result is like an orwellian outer space sweat shop. it's enough to turn you off christmas forever. this and other low-rent mexican children's' films were dubbed in english and widely distributed in the u.s. in the early 1960s; no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in american history. the baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" films as children would be all too eager to turn revolutionary.

when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had children's matinees every saturday and sunday afternoon (anybody remember those?). they showed this thing one year around christmas time. me and some friends went to see it. i expected a cool santa claus movie. what i got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and truly creepy movie.something about santa claus and merlin the magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) fighting satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). the images had me cringing in my seat. i always found santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help. the guy in the satan suit didn't help. but what really horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled santa's sled. when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements--i remember having nightmares about those things! all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw. my friends were sort of frightened by it too. i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back. this is a creepy, disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it. avoid this one--unless you really want to punish your kids. this gets a 1.

all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains. although the children were much more sadistic in scctm, i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie. as a spanish assignment in spanish 5 we all had to watch it. i'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr. pitch was going to do next. would merlin help santa claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that. :d

this has to be creepiest, most twisted holiday film that i've ever clapped eyes on, and that's saying something. i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion, mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian theology. but their day of the dead isn't half as scary as their take on santa claus.so..santa isn't some jolly, fat red-suited alcoholic(take a look at those rosy cheeks sometime!). rather, he's a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in heaven(or the heavens, whichever), with a bunch of kids who work harder than the one's in kathy lee gifford's sweat shops. they sing oh-so-cute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasn't a little african-american boy in black face singing 'mammy'. this santa is a peeping tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his 'eye in the sky'. this is so he can tell who's been naughty or nice(with an emphasis on those who are naughty, i'd bet).there's no mrs. claus, no elves(what does he need elves for when he's got child labor?) and the reindeer are mechanical wind-up toys! this floating freak show hovers on a cloud, presumably held up by its silver lining.santa's nemesis is...the devil?! what is this, santa our lord and savior? weird. anyhoo, satan sends one of his minions, a mincing, prancing devil named pitch, to try to screw up christmas. let me get this straight-the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday? seems kind of redundant, doesn't it?pitch is totally ineffectual. he tries to talk some children into being bad, but doesn't have much luck. i was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl lupe, who's family is very poor. all that she wants is a doll for christmas, but he parents can't afford to buy her one(they spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of). so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. in reality, that's the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll, because being saintly and praying to god and holy santa doesn't really work. but lupe resists temptation and tells pitch to get thee behind her, and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it's chucky's sister.along the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a tree(uh-huh) from whence he's rescued by merlin! merlin? you have got to be kidding me! since when do mythical druidic figures appear in christmas tales, or have anything to do with a christian religion? and doesn't god disapprove of magic? they'd have been burning merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the rescue of one of god's aspects(or that's what i assume santa must be, to be going up against satan). this movie is one long huh? from start to finish, and it'll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasn't spiked or something. probably it was, since this movie is like one long giant dt.

this film is awful. give me the dentist anytime! can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film! i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this. the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting, better plot, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. don't even watch it if you're drunk!

some might say something like "baby geniuses" with its giant robot infants or "dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. you might say that too, but you'd be wrong. lo and behold, for i bring to you: santa claus, the most helplessly messed up family film since ... well, ever. from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from barcelona), this is childhood trauma at its finest. and no matter how hard i try, no matter how many different therapists i visit, i just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head! avoid this mind-bending piece of trash like you'd avoid a sex-starved whale during mating season. still, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you, i guess you should give it a try. but really, this movie isn't worth your time and mental health.

pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning. as an example, bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. why? they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive.this film has absolutely no substance. the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero. why? he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking. no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone. even worse, when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist, no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends.jason priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero.the ending is absolutely unbelievable.

the original "vanishing point" was a great flick. subtle motives, characters that seemed real and spontaneous.the remake was terrible. preachy, overtly obvious; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic. the black charger was cool, but even that couldn't rescue this flick. why stick with a white challenger? i didn't think that was the best choice back in '71. some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "dream quest". his indian pal was standing next to him. vigo was only wearing his white briefs. i'm sorry - it just looked silly - him surveying the vista in his fruit of the looms. another scene was at the end - after the explosive crash into the bulldosers - the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph. then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren't found because he vaporized, but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! first of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. secondly, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to steer it. it would promptly roll over about 30 times. thirdly, if you hit the pavement at 180 mph, you would wind up in various squishy pieces. no matter, we see him at the end standing with his daughter. all in all, a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence.

this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'vanishing point' the original, is so ironic. i'm sure it wasn't intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. the real 'vanishing point' was the end of an era, which pretty much ended in the early 1970s. in this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. "sanitized for your protection" inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. i'm glad i watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. the original is a cult classic and golden. this remake is dreadful.

this is a terrible remake of a marginal, but well liked, movie from the early 70's. i have seen the original at least 6 times. the 1997 version is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' into 2 hours or whatever the runtime is. cheesy storyline, which by the way, is completely different than the original. the major government involvement was far-fetched. there is no flow from one scene to the next. in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up. it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car. it takes many times longer than that in real life. car guys notice this stuff. also, the fool or fools that chose to trash a 1968 charger and abuse a 1970 challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet. the fact they aren't 'car people' is painfully obvious, and their passing will not be grieved. the actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. one step above a monotone. a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic.last but surely not least, the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). that is total garbage. can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof?? hahahaha!! this movie is a joke. don't waste your time watching this one.

this is just plain bad. sometimes remakes, even if they stray from the original, are good on their own. they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be. this wasn't any good even standing on it's own. viggo mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired. the original "vanishing point" was such a thrilling, psychological adventure; this is not an adventure at all, and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever. this was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making, stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today's film-going audience. basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. it's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film, and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily. the manipulative plot devices, the "make-it-obvious-so-they-don't-miss-the-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateurish direction...this is plain bad....

movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive, boring, and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. i am glad that aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this p.o.s. go back and watch the 1971 version, count the things that would never be included in a modern version, and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas, and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.

yuck! and again i say...yuck! the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. and, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.this version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.there was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...

oh, dear lord.... they've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest.the original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero kowalski. he was a man trying to drive from denver to san fransisco to win a bet. why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? we're not really sure.we had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. that point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself vanishes. he lives only to be free, and means no ill on anyone. we saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.when he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity. he died like he lived, running wide open.in the remake kowalski has a whole history (including a first name, even.) he's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy. he is a devoted husband, and excited expectant father. he comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery, but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers. they even gave the part of "super soul," the blind dj (brilliantly portrayed by clevon little in the original) to jason priestly?!?!?!?!?!? give me a break.

i found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. i never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. i got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time, or my friend's. i think this story is not worth telling. it's like saying that old people have a past before they got old (no kidding). the lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes. however, i think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. i've always been a big fan of ellen burstyn. i'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try.

margret laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film, let alone the stone angel. hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (gainsay who dare, anyone?), and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process. the symbols in the book (the stone angel, silver thread, etc, etc.) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new, and the carnage (so to speak) along the way.while the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it isn't really a plot kind-of storytelling, is it?), i think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film. hagar's defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there. bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed, and hagar's father could have been played more "traditionally", so to speak. if the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would drive the point straight to home.along the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points (e.g., the muslim girlfriend and the native people). hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the film version. modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically-correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like throwing punches below the intellect.there is also the audience. it seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable. why should be laugh every time hagar is at her tantrums? i doubt magaret laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, hagar. these people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them. i don't think it did hagar and other folks in her situation any justice.

the back of the dvd box says ellen page co-stars in this movie. she does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role. i don't consider it a supporting role either, but rather a "bit" part. also the plot has many unexplained elements. some examples are: why does the main character reject her oldest son? why does her youngest son drive head on into the train? he says its for a "sucker" bet which doesn't explain anything. obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet. this film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen.

even for the cocaine laced 1980's this is a pathetic. i don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid, time, effort, money, and audience brain cells to make such drivel. if your going to make a comedy, make it funny. if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself. if you're going to release it as a joke like this: don't!!! i mean, it was a joke right? someone please tell me this was a joke. please.

yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies, but i have definately seen worse. think gremlins rated r. well anyway, i met rick sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! it was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in).he seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the mst3k version!all in all, rick sloane knew what he was doing. and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks. so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow msties. sorry guys.

this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself. i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage. the main characters are the whiny non-hero kevin, amy, his bratty, ungodly conservative girlfriend, kyle, a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex, daphne, a scrawny, horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" and has no sense of how to dress, and her oversexed boyfriend nick, an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything. no, i'm not a pervert, that's really how the movie goes. the movie itself is an over-sexed rip-off of 1986's gremlins, only you'll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere. no, these hobgoblins, unleashed by wimpy man (i'm sorry, kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. yes, you guessed it-eventually, they wind up in a strip club, where the nerdy amy's greatest dream is revealed-she wants to be a stripper! look, i watched this flick via mst3k, and even with mike nelson, tom servo, and crow t. robot making a laughing-stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes. not really, but i wish i had. i'm not giving you anymore plot, because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain. besides, it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning. they should put a surgeon's general warning on this film.

ah, the infamous "guinea pig" series...i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ("he never dies","mermaid in a manhole", and "flower of flesh and blood" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but "devil's experiment" just plain blows. there is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake "snuff" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, but "devil's experiment" just doesn't hold up. worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...

this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest, in my opinion. a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. and at this point, i will say that these films are not real! they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible.the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases. for example, when they kick the girl in the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl! and how stupid this looks! the sound effects are also unrealistic and don't make sense. other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the ripping off of fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that. very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant. this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, although it is not as bloody as the next part, flowers of flesh and blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible.guinea pig: devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is. this is still (of course) faked s(n/t)uff, the only difference to genuine "snuff film" is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film. i cannot recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s****y and repulsive. they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it. i watched this as a curiosity (as the other parts in the series) and now i know how insignificant trash these are. they work only in shock level and that's not too valuable cinematic achievement. devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i've seen and mermaid in a manhole (guinea pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film i've seen. so these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.

this movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse's acting. i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.her delivery is robotic. when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. so, her voice has very little inflection. i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. she has to know somebody in the biz.now i hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be "this" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.however, i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it. the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. but the end was disappointing as well. maybe if her acting had been better, i would have liked it.

here's a review for people like me. this movie sucks from beginning to end. i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000. the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. the lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? and she's rich???? and she's a famous psychologist????? come on, people. she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. rain man would have been insulted. i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters, war-starters, and fur-wearers. my hatred is so complete that it defies logic. but i'll give it a shot. that it's not supposed to sound real is fine. i don't care. it's that everyone talks the same. mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. no wonder his actors are so wooden. they're confused about everyone being the same character. (however, his later films do improve.)

by far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other. but this film never pulls this off. every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. perhaps mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. if so, he failed. the lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time... but it wasn't. as for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it. i really liked the street scenes though. looked just like an edward hopper painting.

the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent. the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie. it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines, rather than responding to one another. while the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color) the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre.given that the presentation had no appeal to me, i was at least expecting an engaging story. usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists, but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes. by the time of the, "gee, i forgot the $80,000," moment, i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous. for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief. if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart.this wooden production left me cold.

david mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best-selling author. margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named mike (played by joe mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film). she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book). she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.i don't feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of $80,000.first of all, the big twist towards the end was very predictable. any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned? besides, margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind, she knows full well that mike is a con artist.secondly, we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do. first, she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. if she hadn't done this, the entire con would have failed. i just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt. not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. what are the odds of this happening? and yet the whole con is based on this premise.another problem i had is with the ending. margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on mike. at first, mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area. somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. not only that, but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. and if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.

the plot of 'house of games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters, but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge. that's about the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets. it has to be the director mamet: lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career, so she can't perform this badly all the time. she's supposed to go from uptight, cool, controlled professional to calculating, wicked fast lady having fun, as shown by the change from beige trouser suit (which she seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to floppy floral sundress. but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped, precise way; i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed. the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create. at times 'house of games' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk, and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot. the clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic, two-dimensional performances. and they smoke too much!!!

i was seriously looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed truly promising from the coming attractions: jim carrey with godlike powers was an idea that most definitely worked for me. as a huge fan, i was sure he'd be supremely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because i saw the movie. the first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against god) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by god via telephone and receives powers almighty) is great - carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny. but the third act is wretched beyond belief.the rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between bruce and his girlfriend grace (jennifer aniston, who comes off exceedingly well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her name reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?she doesn't think so. she wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still loves him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end i was praying, too. . .for it to be over. i didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, bruce prances into the room singing "what if god were one of us, just a slob like one of us", blah blah blah), and i was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, morgan freeman - a/k/a god - tells bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). those choices were forgivable - this is a jim carrey comedy, directed by tom shadyac - it aint the remains of the day. or rather it was supposed to be a comedy. when the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) message movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that grace is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued. all this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. the film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points. unfortunately, the writers and shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. they even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste. it didn't work for me.

why did i go to see this film? honestly, because jim carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star jennifer aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.however, as my "one line summary" suggests, i was disappointed. for various reasons;reason 1: it wasn't funny. in a 2hour movie, i laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time i sat thinking "i really should have got some ice-cream". i admit that maybe it is wrong to judge jim carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes gem's such as 'the truman show' , 'liar liar' , 'me, myself and irene' , 'dumb and dumber' , 'the mask', and the 'ace ventura' films then produces, in bruce nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?reason 2: jennifer aniston's role was criminally underwritten. i mean hello! she's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. wrong.reason 3: one word - clichéreason 4: a casual deployment of specifically american references - jimmy hoffa, walter cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. "a teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - that's a miracle! want to see a miracle soon? be the miracle!" god tells bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the us, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. additionally, i still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?in this film there are enough funny carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent bruce almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.

jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. he has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala ace ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. or, in the case of 'liar liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. he was excellent in both 'man on the moon' and 'the truman show.' the guy is remarkable.then comes 'bruce almighty,' an ideal vehicle for carrey, and a premise that should have worked; carrey, after complaining about god and how his life stinks, is enabled with god's powers. however, the script is pure recycled garbage. now, no matter how bad a script is, carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. he seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.i have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on 'friends' and she was superb in last year's 'the good girl.' she too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. she comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.'bruce almighty' should have been a comedy that works. but it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. a few minor giggles (his internet is yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. the movie fails on nearly every level. that's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. but hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it.

when i read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, i though that was clever and original concept. casting was promising too, carrey, freeman, aniston... how can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? it can. idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. bruce nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely deserves (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and oh horror!!!! dog who is not house trained!!! yes, as soon as bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a "god, why do you hate me!" manner, average viewer must think: "why, what's wrong with your life, bruce?". bruce is not, and definitely not the man with real problems in life. most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but god still addresses to him. why? though morgan freeman looks nice as a god, i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers? god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. no, wait, a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce. what does bruce do? pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! no more, bruce, please! what bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is "nice, family, little movie" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! nothing. just carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. aniston here is understated. she plays pale, undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. these two are not meant to be together. i would give three stars, but i doubt movie deserves a one. bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. but ok, there were few funny moments, and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.

i caught this movie on fx last night, and as i was sitting there watching it, it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever. bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally unbelievable fight sequences, stupid characters. all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen. it was so bad, i was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi-competent that i had to keep watching... and they made a sequel!

play mystery theater 3000 at home with your friends! rent this movie for the laughs! the acting is poor, the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable. i thought the movie was a joke until i looked it up on imbd. i can't wait to rent the sequel, china o'brien ii.

a pale shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that the director, richard attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, needlessly "opens" it up, and muddies the thrust of the play. the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a b'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work. attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working "gypsies" living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers. the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene, showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count cassie, who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie). anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film.

i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city.. i was younger then.. but it was an excellent play.. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it.. and why michael douglas ??? he didnt suit the role.. this movie really sucked big time !!!my advise is not to rent this movie.. save your money for something better like "cats" ....

this film is regarded by some as a classic - i've no idea why. it is terrible to the point of being laughable. the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.there are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but so what! there is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and michael douglas is as depressing as ever. my brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! he was right.normally with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case i think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective.

hi, everyone, if you saw "singing in the rain," you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain. you also remember the dance number of donald o'connor, "make 'em laugh." if you saw "royal wedding," you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling. if you saw "jailhouse rock," you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself.that is what is missing here. there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. the closest was chuck mcgowan's "i can do that." the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film. richard attenborough was to blame for this failure. he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing.yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment. michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy. he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at. it does not work here.the cast was good except for michael, of course. a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it.next time they do one of these i hope they call me first.tom willett

for anyone who has seen and fallen in love with the stage musical a chorus line, the movie is a shoddy substitute. not only are songs cut, but unnecessary plot twists added, new dance sequences choreographed, and, let's face it, richard attenborough just doesn't know how to film dancers.onstage, michael bennett's a chorus line was just that: michael bennett. his idea, his choreography, his direction, his gift to broadway and the rest of the world. it was two hours of hard-hitting, in-your-face realism that really made you feel for these "boys" and "girls." the movie, however, lacks empathy and depth: the actors look like they are auditioning for a chorus line rather than actually auditioning. every move, every line of dialogue seems so weighted and planned; michael douglas, especially, as zach is too in control for us to believe that he is this extraordinarily bitchy choreographer. even when he throws his temper tantrums, you never quite believe him because every gesture, every accented word, every nuance is so obviously rehearsed. and as for him not dancing: kevin kline auditioned for the role of zach on broadway. michael bennett loved his reading, but kline couldn't dance and ultimately lost the part. how i wish they had done the same for douglas! a chorus line is supposed to be a show about nobodies, and aside from a few recognizable faces (vicki frederick, who played cassie on broadway, as sheila and khandi alexander, of tv's newsradio, as one of the many auditioning dancers) you're not supposed to know any of these people. because you do know these people. having a star in any of the roles is a terrible decision: when you focus on michael douglas and his ranting instead of on the girls and boys on the line and their stories, you lose something.it is truly unfortunate that the best sequence in the show (montage: hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love) is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song entitled "surprise, surprise" that surprisingly received a nomination at the oscars. cassie's "mirror dance" has a new song and tragically boring choreography -- one wonders why they bothered to shoot a movie version at all if they were going to mess with a working formula this much.for fans of musical theatre and those who enjoyed the stage version, this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved. for those who never got to see the original production, either on broadway or on tour, this movie is the only reference they will have to go by. and they'll have to wonder just how it got to be the longest-running musical in broadway history -- until a little show called cats overtook it in the late 1990's. but that is a different story, and don't even get me started there.

the broadway musical, "a chorus line" is arguably the best musical in theatre. it's about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. the film version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance, whatsoever. the biggest mistake was made in giving the director's job to sir richard attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for "gandhi." why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?which brings us to the next problem. "a chorus line" takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes. it's the least flashy of broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. however, that doesn't translate well to film, and no one really thought that it would. for that reason, the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers, and should have left the theatre and audition process. the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. heck, they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations. yet, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film, as attenborough's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director (michael douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. douglas' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. the very beautiful "hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love"--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful, "surprise," a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar. adding insult to injury, "surprise" simply retold the same story as "hello, love" but without the wit or pathos.there is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film. if you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is bob fosse's brilliant "all that jazz." while fosse's daughter is in "a chorus line," he is the fosse who should have been involved, as director. he would have known what to do with this material, which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort.

by the time this film was released i had seen chorus line on stage 4 times, and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story. my wife and i were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released. it was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. first, the story was "moved outside," so to speak, by including scenes not in the confines of the theater. those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story. second & third together (assign your own order): one of the original songs, with very dynamic dance number, was removed; a song which was not in the stage production was added. say what ?? i'm confused! the only reason i gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. i've now seen chorus line on stage 6 times, and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before i die. it is superbly written, with wonderful music, and heart- wrenchingly true stories. if you want to see a musical which includes a great "cattle call" audition, i recommend all that jazz. if you want to see the story of a chorus line, see it on stage.

i recently bought the dvd, forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of "a chorus line." every change the director attenborough made to the story failed.by making the director-cassie relationship so prominent, the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window.some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed. the show's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie's character.the overall staging is very self-conscious.the only reason i give it a 2, is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.

michael bennett and nicholas dante's broadway show ran for years, but evidence of its power and charisma is lost in this movie adaptation, which most likely stems from the choice of director (richard attenborough, as far from b-way as you could get) and lead actor (michael douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). the slim story, about a grueling audition for a broadway show which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singers, is pushed right up on us, with loud, brassy talents playing to the rafters. nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a laughable subplot about a ex-dancer returning to the theater and butting heads with old-flame douglas. the over-eager hopefuls are filled with promise and heartache, but their personal stories of angst are a little embarrassing; this, matched with attenborough's sluggish pacing, spells disaster, and even the now-famous songs fail to break through the artificial wrapping. *1/2 from ****

this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever. even the music has been destroyed. attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false. i will say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny.the hairstyles are remarkably dated. i can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where "a chorus line" is playing. are we to think that these people are auditioning for "a chorus line," which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? oh no, the show is collapsing on itself.i saw the original production, and have listened to the album hundreds of times. why, oh, why, did they do this?

this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful. this movie misses the mark in almost every way. even the casting is baffling. take audrey landers as val. "dance 10 looks 3" is val's song. val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she's a great dancer. what do the brilliant filmmakers do? they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great. way to miss the boat.then there's the choreography. i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave. why didn't they use his choreography? it really can't be improved upon.

i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage. the interesting thing is that you never got to see zach's face. he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production. whe i heard they were making a movie from it, i waited with bated breath, but when i watched the movie version i was so bummed-out disappointed that i felt i was cheated. the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character. personally, i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived, i would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.

if you were to judge based on the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical "a chorus line" a pulitzer prize, and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years, were all on heavy narcotics, because one singular sensation this film certainly is not.what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me, but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay.not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. thus we are assaulted with the oscar-nominated(!) "surprise, surprise." well surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and so does the movie.grade: d

i'm not a stage purist. a movie could have been made of this play, and it would almost necessarily require changes... comme ci, comme ca. but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full-on "shallow blockbuster" mode. it would be hard to imagine a worse director. perhaps only josh logan & jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did.onstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method. dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage-career experiences (very 70s!). then bennett and hamlisch took some time, handed them a song and cast them as themselves. ...astonishing! unbelievably modern. the 'story'of acl is (in turn) about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of, because the play doesn't matter. it was meta before the idea was invented, 25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea. acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive, & which is a hallmark of modern creativity: that technique itself is compelling... that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters. what a gracious idea. the stage play had one performance area (an empty stage) and three different ways to alter the backdrop, to alleviate visual tedium, not to keep viewers distracted. the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted. it worked just fine. that was the point. all these ideas are trampled or bastardized. set-wise, there wasn't one, and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows, in which the exhilarating "one" is finally, powerfully, performed in full (gold) top hats and tails, with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions. the pent-up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts. after grampa manhandles this, it's like a mushed, strangled bird. he clearly has the earlier, respected all that jazz (and fosse's stage piece dancin') in mind as he makes his choices. hamlisch's score was edgy & interesting for it's time, but time has not been kind to it. it's as schmaltzy as "jazz hands." and that's before attenborough ever touches it. he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left, and mangling it. a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this, "could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these?" a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater (pivotal by it's absence in theater) would be addressed in the film format. there's never been a more "frontal" play. the answer they came up with was, "i'm sorry.. what was the question?" the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives, to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience, and blending their grating selves together. i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope, clowning at the (absent) audience. the play made you understand theater people. this movie just makes you want to choke them.perhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience (les miz, miss saigon) instead of relating to other characters started here. but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie. a chorus line is pure schlock.

yes, i was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of michael bennett's hit musical. it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. it is awful. almost everything fails. first off, attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie. the camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the casting!!! they are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. but this cast just gets by dancing, does a "nice" job singing but none of them spark one bit. in fact, look up the cast on imdb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (ok, ok, janet jones married gretzky - sheesh). so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. a total strike-out! (but even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was).

on broadway, a chorus line was pure magic. from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale, a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show, we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories, some funny, some clever, some stirring, of this chorus line. the movie is another matter entirely. the focus is now on the director - and what an ogre he is! every time the film switches to michael douglas, there he is with a bitter, sour expression, barking out questions and orders, screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. yikes!! that changes the dynamics of the story. on broadway, the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence, but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong/fragile/intriguing/hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize! and actually in one of the only moments the director appears, he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart-breaking story. he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection/ concern for cassie. but in the movie, from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders, the chorus line members' stories become secondary. it's like they are in a lousy profession, where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show, is jaded, exhausted, furious at having to audition these chorus members. on stage, there was always the excitement of the show. here in the movie practically from the word go, you feel sorry for everyone involved. during the course of the musical, we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well, and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! but of course that couldn't happen. but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage, sometimes reflecting us in the audience, in our hearts, and we know, also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected, they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much, bringing magic to the theatre. in the movie, after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis, that magic becomes totally diluted. all we feel (even with the exact same curtain call), is that some of the members got a job with a mean-spirited director. so they all come on the screen and are dancing again. big deal.

i admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. i never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because i adored the original show. imagine my dismay.this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made. they changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. i was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror, at the ballet, and hello twelve, hello thirteen. not! not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the storyline, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello cassie and michael douglas) not present in the original, and injecting "drama" where it wasn't necessary. the original had enough pathos on its own. if you were a fan of the original broadway show, don't bother. i'm sorry i wasted my time, and diluted my memories, watching this tripe.

i saw the original "chorus line" on broadway god knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. michael bennett knew he would have to re-imagine "chorus" for the screen but could never figure out how to do it. if the man who came up with the show is stumped - that should answer your question. there are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. however, richard attenborough fresh of the musical work of "ghandi" and dancing with animals in "doctor doolittle" ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show. horrible songs were added (surprise! surprise!), great songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). michael douglas was mis-cast. people that couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy "landers" woman who couldn't sing, act, or dance - i guess she had just finished being ghandi's wife. the dances by jeffrey hornaday look like nothing more than schlock from "flashdance" rejects and nothing works. i sat there stunned at how something so riveting and emotional could be drained to nothing. if you truly love this show and it is coming back to broadway in 2006 - see it but don't think that the long running musical event that was "a chorus line" has any thing at all to do with this film.

for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film, this film is ok as movie musicals, nothing special, just ok. i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production, the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin. first of all, for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production, let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play, the director, producer, and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. a real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes. if you're auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out. michael bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. the play is about these dancers. first of all, director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie/zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach. in the play, you never see zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon. cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry (a character who is not even in the play)was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. major musical numbers were cut or rethought. the opening number in the play "i hope i get it" shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance (can you say "audrey landers"). "goodbye 12, goodbye 13, hello love", a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as "surprise, surprise" mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie. the show's most famous song, "what i did for love" which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance, becomes just another standard love song in the film, performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie. jeffrey hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers, the choreography has to be special. there are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie, michelle johnston as bebe, and janet jones as judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet audrey landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show's best numbers, "dance 10, looks 3." i will admit that the finale, "one" is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that. i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage, this film might be worth a look, but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.

i wonder who, how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years? he's an academy award winning director. yes, he won for ghandi you moron! jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa? he has experience with musicals. really? "oh what a lovely war" have you forgotten? to answer your question, yes! the film is a disappointment, clear and simple. not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings. every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical. i felt nothing. but when i saw it on stage i felt everything. the film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. great actors who could dance beautifully. well michael douglas was in it. true i forgot i'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical.

what's with indonesian musical movies? never have i seen indonesian musical movies like the ones made in bollywood. they miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.this story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. it's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. the main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying. as for the casting, i don't feel the necessity to put a balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.the strange thing is, why would i want to watch this movie? maybe because of the mangoes...

if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let it be boy. but prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio.after having watched such a good movie as arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they come up with again in indonesia. it seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems seriously to work on the image of indonesia in the world of entertainment. that it is a 'global' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in indonesia. and since the indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as 'made in indonesia' with a flavor of the west, they get away with it.ok, the story is nice to begin with. and it could have developed into a nice flick. but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good playback, and secondly good choreography? in this movie, the playback is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema. every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing playback, and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie.the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical... they only forgot to change the choreography. it is hardly dancing you see, they jump here and there, throw their legs up in the air, and that is about it.well, at least there's a happy ending.... but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, do so!

this film features ben chaplin as a bored bank employee in england who orders a mail order bride from russia, recieves nicole kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprise, she isn't what she appears to be. the story is fairly predictible and chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying. kidman is actualy rather good in this role, making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting. grade: c

nothing in this film interested me. i thought the actors were asleep while they were performing. that's not laid-back stanislofsky method, that's just walking-through and saying lines, i'm afraid. kidman's performance is sad. the story is, however, mildly entertaining if you want to put up with the bad acting.

this movie is the worst ive seen.. nicole kidman really dissapointed me.. this movie has nothing. i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth. great actors but bad script.

this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd. however, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? the story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. what starts out as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word i use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. nicole kidman should know better, and ben chaplin is wasted! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel, whom i can only presume did this for the money.this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. it's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. a film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films!

it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of russians, or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in england; and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. in addition, nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains, but far to be the russian one. so nicole, if you really want to talk russian, kindly go to moscow or st. petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation.

birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy,, is it a drama...it just doesn't know. what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land. the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out. this is a real shame if you look at the cast - it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine. very disappointing.

yes, this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes. then they introduce jinx, a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now. kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space. this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things. give it a rest, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts just yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp. however, you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role. so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me. probably for a few others as well, who else would like to see kate capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature.

mix exotic tropical locations, babes in skimpy attire, explosions, good-looking dudley do-right clones, a movie star with his best years behind him (martin sheen), a little martial arts and a sexy villainess (tracy lor.....er, sorry...tracy elizabeth lords) and you'd think you'd be in for some escapist fun. not so! this is a dreary tv movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a "charlie's angels" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent c.a. movies. this abomination is best described as a third rate andy sidaris film. nowhere near as much fun as andy's "hard ticket to hawaii", although some of the fight scenes are decent enough. the girls spend too much time posing and trying too look prissy and it gets annoying after a while. there's better genre stuff that this out there. oh yeah, and the "babes" aren't as hot as they like to think they are. terrible soundtrack...when it's there.

first, ifc runs town and country, and now this. the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip-off is that town and country was watchable. this isn't.i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime. belushi is especially irritating. his scene with candy (doing a z-grade dom deluise) was torture. speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless shepherd, and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts!the real "crime" (besides this being green-lighted) is shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half-million bucks! if you buy that, i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in!

someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high noon. now that is a real stretch! i'm a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don knotts. first off, as someone pointed out, sinatra just doesn't have the build for a western bad-guy wannabe. he's just too 'slight' at this point in his life. maybe he was about the same height as say audie murphy, but murphy had a pretty solid build. sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously.the story is uninspired and really not credible. i don't want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story doesn't make any sense. another thing, these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy'. this is just a little town, so i don't get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way.there is a 'love interest' in the story and if i followed it right, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy wouldn't kill him. now there's true love for you. 'stand up for yourself! tell him your name so he will kill you!' lol. stop, you're killing me.unfortunately the basic premise of the movie isn't good enough and no matter how they tried this story didn't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket. want to know why it's not on video and never shown on tv? the critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible.you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy? try tension at table rock, or at gunpoint - two really, really good westerns with that theme. johnny concho is johnny stinko. frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you didn't belong in a movie like this.

frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. he was a great actor, from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. but he tried to do his job well in johnny concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. i blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it? i think that this film should not have been withdrawn, because any film with sinatra is worth seeing, and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable

i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival's prestigious competition section. i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality.the film, some reviewers, have noted does not have too much of gunfire--but the inherent violence is repulsive. imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla's "godfather" that seem to resurface here in this chinese/hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.this film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here. at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values.

it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the source.here's a review without pretensions:just when you think nothing is going to happen, it doesn't.dress it up any way you like, this is a dull film, full of unengaging characters doing very little of interest.one to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like, so deep, man.not something to watch for your own pleasure though.unless.you're.pretentious.

cut tries to be like most post-scream slashers tried to be, a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies. now, i am not bagging 'scream,' as i think 'scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy. cut fails on most levels. it has its moments but overall it just does not work out, not even as a "so bad it's good" movie, just a below average one.the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well, apart from the fact that kylie minogue can't really act, and ironically she gets her tongue out, go figure. go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off, which is apparently cursed. and, as you have probably predicted, one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman.unoriginal plot, poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow. there is plenty of referencing in the film, everything from 'scream' to 'the texas chain saw massacre.' this isn't smart either, it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream. for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it. really, i should be supporting this movie because i'm australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror (we do have our gems, though) but cut is definitely not one of them.however, it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so, so that is something good at least. i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans, who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away.2/5

geez! this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't. i mean, you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind.to be honest and brief; this is one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. i can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers.the death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied "popcorn" from 1991.to make things even worse, this isn't a movie so bad that it's good. it's just plain bad.molly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough.

everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she'll one day turn out to be, etc. i think they're just being nice. even kimble rendall, who directed this film, shows more talent than she does. "the next jane campion", they call her; and, even apart from the fact that they're both over-rated, the two have so much in common. they both direct movies. they're both women. they're both australian. (well, give or take.)yep: it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. but i'll say this for carruthers: she's cute. -and fascinating. no, really. here are some thoughts on her lack of talent:(1) part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people. why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her? so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed, i expect.(2) why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen? after all, it must have been filmed on a real movie set. how could they get it wrong? if rendall's set was half as much of an under-staffed shambles it's a wonder he completed his film at all.(3) carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick. fat chance. i doubt it can be done these days. i suspect that rendall - the actual, and more talented, director - set himself the same task, realised it couldn't be done, and settled for (sigh) knowing parody instead. of course, it's not enough of a parody to work as a parody. as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well, less badly.(4) and yet, and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of 80s horror, starring (this is too good to be true) molly ringwald. this pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (it's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie-within-the-movie, rather than the movie.) yet it, too, was filmed in the late 1990s. perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror. you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it.(5) i'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents, but now i know. and strangely, i'm glad i know. a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled.

this film was made and cast from my home town. i remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact molly ringwald was in town...storyline...essentially 20 years after a film was "laid to rest" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. it would seem someone does not want the film completed.the storyline is flimsy. one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph. the characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant. it is weird hearing kylie's accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role. but that doesn't redeem the film at all. goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly ringwald. perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an aussie actor would have done just fine.as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. that is never a good look. also, the shots had a rough feel about them. over lit perhaps? just not as smooth as one is used to.the killer. lord. could it be less frightening? there are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes. i did like the film, but it was not great. it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. they had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed. maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better.now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny. or so unbelieveable they were funny. but i am not convinced.lm.

normally i'm not motivated to write reviews. but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must. i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the "most tense" moment of the movie. molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. even the "twist" at the end wasn't. i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously; but i could find little evidence of that in the movie.cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else!

"cut" is a film about some film students making a film. it's very much in the "scream" mold, an ironic, self-referential horror flick which, for me at least, falls down because for all its irony, it's still just a bad horror film, same as the films its referring to.but it was not without its charms. well, one charm anyway. molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt, bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew. she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act, although everyone involved with "cut" says she was lovely to work with. :-)seriously, every scene of her pouting, sulking or snapping was great. everyone else, however, wavered between being ok and being terribly wooden.anyway, "cut" has some laughs, a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome), and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film.

oh man, does this movie ever bite! if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre, done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher films) cut is it. every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting. oh, the acting redefines the word horror. i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off.

slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. i happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. the script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. just an all round stinker, that i wasted time of my life on. this had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. who greenlit this mess?i only liked two things in this movie. the first was the killer's mask - which was nice. the second was the austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.save yourself, and avoid this hideous mess.

slash flicks come few and far between now a days, so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it. those good things i heard were all wrong..very wrong! this flick is bad and i mean bad. it's just plain stupid. everything about it. especially the killer's origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end. there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick. just another slasher wannabe with those "hip," "self aware." "movie savvy" characters. i'm so sick of that crap. someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood, literally.

this was my first, and probably the last angelopoulos movie. i was eager to get into it, as it featured mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo, of whom i've heard a lot. the opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian-greek border. ok! but that was all. nothing left. the movie had big holes and i don't know which to mention first. the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. it's like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. all that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. in a moment, the equippe of tv was heading to the bar. they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. a lot of problems with the story-telling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. poor mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. on the other hand, as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about "humanity" as a red in another review. a lot more to say, but no time to lose on a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.

having enjoyed jean arthur in "the devil and miss jones", my interest was peaked, so i tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey--but i didn't make it to the end. arthur, photographed in a gauzy, movie-magazine fashion, either wants alimony from ex-husband william powell or another shot at marriage, but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks (she's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness, but once inside a morgue--like all women in these '30's comedies--she faints). william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur, but you'd never know it from the end result; they look awkward standing next to each other, hesitant over their banter. the actor playing powell's valet is excruciating, and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease.

apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called "movie." they described "blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence." i saw no "intrigue." i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. i saw no "violence." at least, i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with "impervious" skin--but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the "plot." furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable. whatever you may choose to do, i will always remain correct, jonathan tanner  p.s. i was not blinded by the choreography.

i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. i buy them for fight scenes. a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes, but not the other way around.the story was decent, but moved too slowly for my tastes. there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout, lasting only a couple of minutes apiece. the last fight was a bit longer, but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it.

philip. k. dickian movie. and a decent one for that matter. better than the paycheck (woo) and that abomination called minority report (spielberg). but lets face it, the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me. half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending, and i was regrettably right. but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. no, not at all. first half (as already many here have commented) is awesome. there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future (we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can) or is it simply over combining. but the paranoia is there and feeling "out of joint" also. good one.

basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. but there were a couple things that struck me. first was the use of mouthed epithets. in two cases the scott character mouths one, once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off ("dammit") and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot ("s*%t"). i could be wrong about the second instance but i replayed it several times and that's what it looks like to me. the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the o'brien character goodbye and good luck ("give 'em hell") over the roar of the engines. she must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says "heck". i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing, specifically bombing civilians. the avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used. given what we know about the lemay's later strategy of firebombing japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony. i remember mcnamara's quoting of lemay in "the fog of war", something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal. the ending is way overwrought, in keeping with the movie. it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat (i'm not comparing the films, just the ending!). maybe it's just 'cause he gets blowed up. blowed up real good!!!

there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: major chick davis (pat o'brien). o'brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. but he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. in fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. he's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. his character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. o'brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. two things help this movie: o'brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.

i don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, i was irritated. of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? and there are more cases of illogical behavior. i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, i just can give this movie 1 point...

i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity. (for one, if stallone is out free-climbing by himself, there's no need to carry any gear, but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta "mountain climby," so let's throw them in). for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy (where the movie was filmed), well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.

there are some stallone movies i like, but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. i found this movie hard to believe. for example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. also, in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. also, the treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. also, bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.i liked john lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed. eventually i just couldn't believe the character anymore.not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.

let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. unlike harlin's "elm street 4", and "die hard 2" which i really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. that, my friends, is a script. the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. there are so many awful lines in this movie, i don't even want to have to remember any of them. not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. it's almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. wrong again.the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around lithgow, turner, and the worst of the bunch rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. lithgow played one of the best villains in "ricochet", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. how is that possible? i've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. michael rooker can act. i know this because i have witnessed it in "days of thunder", but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards. has it come to this? when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, i just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.which brings me back to harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. it's his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. the script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. i don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but i really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. if the bad guy's would have won early, maybe i wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!

i am still shuddering at the thought of ever seeing this movie again.i have seen action films, i have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.not only does it have the worst male actor ever (sly stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with iq less than his shoenumber to believe it. furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. it is a set of cliches (of action genre), with sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in rambo iii if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). now there is an actor who can't act a) surprised b) sad c) anything else than his basic face. i would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. explosions are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of july. landscapes are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the alps and himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.

if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here), and retarded dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. i had high hopes based on the trailer. i thought that stalone was going to be forced in his "has-been" days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail. i crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. my limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. judge dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie. the character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves. cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say "yo, adrian!"

oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! cowritten by and starring sylvester stallonethat should have been enoughand featuring too many rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. there are two plots, both lame. one involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. the usually reliable john lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product, is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care "bostid!" in a vague approximation of an english accent. janine turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure, is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot. stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. no deathless lines in this one. no living lines, either.

this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while. it is so awful, that i am not sure where to begin, or even if it is worth it. the plot is the real problem, and i feel sorry for 'sly' as he puts in a decent performance for his part. but that plot ... oh dear oh dear. i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top, whilst the helicopter is on the way. a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes! i could go on: but it isn't worth it. apart from the grim opening (which even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is drivel. sorry folks, but this is about as bad as film making gets.

once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form. this is not it. this is an action movie that lacks convincing action. it stinks. rent something else.

(spoiler included, some would say)this film is not possible to take seriously. at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can't help laughing at it all. try me for the sequence where stallone's character jumps some 20 meters with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite. yeah, what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats? i dunno, but he sure gives reality a run for the money.

had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea. rather than chilling/physcological horror, it relied on effects out in the open- fire and ott body horror- , which didn't scare at all if your over 12. the logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount. waste of good characters- which were the best thing about this film.obviously low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the film really goes nowhere, and- icant believe im going to say this- it needs a hollywood remake. you simply loose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining, malefique isn't watchable to the end to be honest. and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film. really really disappointing- impossible to recommend.

there are so many comments on this film, yet i found them to be misleading. this a corner-cutting, over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. boy meets girl. girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. boy is intrigued. you know the drill: the antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath... toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love. sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character. and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie.

i heard this film was much more stylistic than the films director guy ritchie (lock, stock and two smoking barrels, snatch) had directed before, the problem is, it is possibly too stylistic. basically jake green (jason statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary,and within two years he gambles loads of his money. he is ready to seek revenge against the violence-prone casino owner who got jake sent to prison, dorothy 'mr. d' macha (ray liotta). in the process, doctors tell jake that he has three days left to live as he is dying from a rare blood disease, oh, and macha puts hit men on him. loan sharks zach (vincent pastore) and avi (andré benjamin) are demanding jake pays their cash back, and do some odd jobs for them. the film is filled with jake narrating through some flashbacks, and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about zach and avi, and macha, well, i assume that's what it was. also starring terence maynard as french paul, andrew howard as billy, mark strong as sorter, francesca annis as lily walker, anjela lauren smith as doreen and elana binysh as rachel. the are sequences involving a little bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for moments, and all of these are irritating to the point of confusion and boredom, making it a silly crime drama. pretty poor!

when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has ritchie been found out? is he really that talented? does he really have any genuine original ideas? or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher, tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? what happened to his great sense of humour? where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. however, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club, usual suspects and pulp fiction. it aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. however, it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve.

this movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared...as in, "was it as stupid as revolver?" i too was in the toronto international film festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense. jason stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose. within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by andre 3000 and big pussy (of soprano's fame) which makes no sense at all! then there's some shooting and then there's ray liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's some animation, ray liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house wanna be pretensions and more of liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing...which i'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for...not 5 times anyway. everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and guy ritchie thinks he's yogi bear incarnate. the story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight! the only way this movie could have been worse is if madonna herself was in it.

its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave "i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of" film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have revolver.yes, i did think about it for a little bit after watching, and yes it did kind of make sense, however that doesn't stop it being garbage.waste of money. waste of time.up there as the worst movie i have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.

let this film serve as the death knell to the "big twist" films borne out of the 1990s. known in some circles as the kyser soze syndrome, this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by m. night shayamalan and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind. however, in revolver, director guy ritchie (known in some circles as "mr. madonna"), utilizes the soze motif in a far more obsequious manner. jason statham (with a highly questionable head of hair) stars as jack green (known to all as "mr. green.") he may or may not also be criminal mastermind mr. gold. or, perhaps mr. gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld. i'm not quite certain, but i certainly don't care. revolver is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess i've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time. witness the fractured time structure, the painful jump cuts, the ceaseless inner-monologues, and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. this "everything and the kitchen sink" directing style makes quentin tarantino's oeuvre look sedate. the cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as i was watching it.the film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to mr. green. i wanted to like green as i always enjoy stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. here, though, he struggles along like a remedial reader in a university english literature class. his lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis, macha (ray liotta). feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord, liotta spits, cries, and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos. there are no redeeming qualities to revolver. it's yet another filmic faux pas from ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet.

i would rather of had my eyes gouged out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion. there is no plot. there is no acting ability . ray liota has shamed himself and should be blacklisted from any more work. i am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium. rumor has it that maddona threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a stretcher. actullly, she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna-be-actor-director. i hope she stays in london and never returns to the usa. please do not waste your money on this so called film. i beg of you.

what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. guy ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.his use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. when jason statham's character no longer fears ray liotta, it apparently drives liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. why? basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of statham's character.before anyone starts to say i'm missing the point... i'm not. i get it ok? opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. this seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, although hardly original. the problem is that ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. at the moment when even guy ritchie realises this, he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: the scene when statham gets knocked over by a car - why? the shooting of some scenes as marvel comic animations... again, why?there are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out, or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. myself? i was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that i simply didn't care. frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that i didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.a waste of two hours of my life.

having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time. it seems this movie is like marmite and has split the audience. i have to say that while i agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see mulholland drive) they still have to engage you with the characters. now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's opus, i have to say i couldn't give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it i would have to disagree - i didn't enjoy because i was bored. i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. call it clever if you will - i think it's repetitious.however, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw. just music over black. did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of gr's pretentiousness? or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???

been lurking for a couple of years or so. i have never been moved to post on here before, so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that, but i doubt it. i just watched it on dvd, having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now. i had not read extensively about it, certainly not even thought about the movie in some months. it was just what the buddy picked up in the store, so it got watched.bad mistake.the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster. right from the off, jason statham has hair. like in no other gr movie. or any js movie that i've seen. at least not in the quantities on display here. and ray liotta in underpants should be advance warned. it's scary and funny but not in a ha-ha-humour way. its more in an almost-theoffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-sort-of-humour way. they each say the same thing: "this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be."now, based on previous, extensive, movie-watching experience, i expected this movie to be a few things. like:() coherent,() interesting or engaging,() not a complete and utter farrago of navel-gazing,() something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly-realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a "cool, modern, self-aware art-form",() hopefully better than "the idiots".as you may have guessed by my tone, it thoroughly failed to check any box above. instead it was:(x) badly edited {pace all over the shop, 70s-amateur high-8 style jump cuts, incomprehensible "plot" "twists!!!" delivered through hackneyed flash-back montages, i could go on...},(x) shot as if by a depressed 14yr-old goth who'd just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drapes drawn(x) so up its own behind with the whole "i'm really smart, me" motif/ message, that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure the dumb people (ie: everyone who doesn't like it) in the audience make sure they get the point,(x) a genuine waste of my time.as for the undoubted ability of some people to "get" something from this, fine. i'm glad you enjoyed it. one poster said something that caught my attention: under-25s probably understood it better because of the editing. maybe, but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible, not less. as for the "genius is only recognised by the enlightened" brigade out there, go suck an onion and grow up. there is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say the reason another person doesn't know great art is because they don't understand the 'craft /materials /moon cycle /filaments of supreme rational thought' which the 'auteur /poet/ artist/ palm reader/ idiot savant' is using to explain his or her 'vision /grand scheme /oneness with gaea /great big bucket of dog-sick'.for me and many, many more people, its garbage. movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving. in some direction be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you're having yourself.the only way this moved me was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable demise. "the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all"and now, please, by all means, toast my buns for me.

vulpine massacre should have been this movies actual title. and the tag-line should have read "guaranteed to make your kids cry!" this is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region. starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them. the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den, giving insight into the animals loves and lives... lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals. sounds good huh? well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core...*** spoilers below - or they it may be a warning!***almost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind. but seems to get along well enough and there's a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him... and then he dies... next we have one of the siblings adventures. and then he dies... one of the sisters gets her screen-time... and then she dies...and so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature, in traps, just up and vanish, and even by a bunch of snowmobiles! by the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred. though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen. (least not in the version we saw.) unlike say "tarka the otter" the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out. one or two losses would have been acceptable. it is a nature film after all. but not nearly the whole family.do not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids. watch it with some foreknowledge that things are *not* going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are. you may enjoy it. or you may not...

the film "52 pick up" simply does not work. see it if you are at all interested in elmore leonard or john frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially john glover who's admittedly brilliant. but the book--a slow-burning, noir thriller with lots of pulp--should have translated into an oscar-contending film instead of this dud that couldn't figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard-boiled, gritty crime story of the book, or opt for a 1980s schwarzenegger shoot-em-up spree. shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, detroit (an area where leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to los angeles makes for a substantial problem that leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately can't. it was, for example, a clever device making mitchell's wife a city councilwoman (she had no job in the book), if you think about it: that's the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex-crazed city like 1980s los angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. even then, it's more plausible in a more conservative eastern state like michigan to believe that a) its tiny porno "industry" is a sleazy, money-grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow going through a mid-life crisis, and b) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and old-fashioned wives couldn't handle the shock. as consultant ron jeremy will tell you, 1980s los angeles was a colorful, stylish porno mecca, more like the movie "boogie nights" than leonard's dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. then again, los angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. unfortunately, roy scheider's harry mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. in the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. he also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. elmore leonard's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen. here, harry mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, alan raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. glover's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky "good guy," in charge of the situation as if he were more a rambo with an m-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him. "52 pick up" ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. trapping raimy inside mitchell's jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the "sweet revenge" conclusion of a chuck norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of leonard's book, where mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way. i left the theater shaking my head and depressed. what a waste of talent.

spoilers ahead -- proceed at your own caution.my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers -- with relative ease -- he continues to cave into their demands. and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped, he decides to wire his classic car up to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic.okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign. this i can see, but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit, or even kill them once he'd determined there was no actual blackmail evidence (e.g, cini's body?) this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. after that, it sort of falls apart.

david chase's "the sopranos" is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory. not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion, it's devoid of a soul. as anyone reading likely knows already, james gandolfini *is* tony soprano, a big, fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife, and two bratty, sh*t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of america (that's new jersey, by the way). not only is tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of "saturday night live" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates. it's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me (and apparently only me). allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something american tv hardly allows. but chase - and his entourage of money-gorged, emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of (even obviously fictionalized) organized crime (a la "the godfather"). instead, chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should i say month after month. or is it year after year? it seems like the show's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse). much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to "network" structure, with plot lines that go nowhere, and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin. but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure, why does it always feel like i'm watching a soap-opera? tired mob clichés, bored housewives, self-serving, irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere. more than ever, i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are p*ssed at this show. it's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book (danté's "inferno" springs to mind).people on imdb love to claim that there's nothing good on television, and therefore "the sopranos" is a breath of fresh air. are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch "the shield"? (it's included in basic, ya know). how about the (still good) "the west wing"? or the brilliantly acted (if erratically written) "boston legal"? what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades, "arrested development"? and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds - nobody *has* to watch *anything* new. i'd much rather shell out $40 for an over-priced boxed set of, well, pretty much *anything*, than give hbo $10 a month (or $80 a dvd set!) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be.you want good television? watch "homicide: life on the street." or "murder one". or "picket fences". or even chase's prior show, "northern exposure." if you're already among "the sopranos"'s legion of brain-washed fans and critics, it's too late for you. but if not, leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes. ("sleeping" would be way too kind)

for those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! from the bleak new york city atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. why it won the academy award was because it was so shocking at that time that hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. so, hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. it also hoped, i'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. well, it succeeded on that level. audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.forty years ago, as a very young man, i found this film fascinating, too. however, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth i never watched to view it again. the acting was good, but so what? acting is good in many films. nobody ever said dustin hoffman and jon voight couldn't act. hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. he was kind of like the johnny depp of his era, playing guys like "ratso rizzo" in this film and then going to be the "rain man" later on. yes, "ratso" is a character you'll never forget, and "joe buck" (voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.this movie isn't "art," and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. it's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (andy warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.i did like the catchy song, "everybody's talking'" that helped make harry nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because fred neil wrote the song and sang it better, before nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of neil (which is their loss). and - as mentioned - the name "ratso rizzo" kind of stays with you!the film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, i fear: this marked it as "official" that hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.

do you like stand up? then stay away from this...during the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, but unless they got some cute qualities, they got a snowballs chance. any controversial material and you are out! ...and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when i see who the crooked judges are letting in.1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with.it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.if the producers changed the name of the contest to "last clown standing", all my criticism would loose validity. maybe an idea?

i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for, "last comic standing." if they don't have a good agent, then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! if they do make it to an audition, i was told that it's "pre-determined" if they get a second chance. so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us.if the comics do make it to the show, then most of them don't get imdb credits. i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of, "last comic standing" and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job. it's really a disgrace. a month ago, i asked, "last comic standing 7" on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page!!! i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this. i just want people to know the truth. i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians. comedians get exploited on hbo, bet, tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen.please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmb4-hyet_y

this movie is just plain terrible!!!! slow acting, slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been on there. the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it. the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it!! the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost. avoid it!!!

i've finally seen the incubus after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. the incubus is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. the film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc...the film is totally predictable from beginning to end. even the stupid "big" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. and i figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment i saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ending arrived, i wasn't shocked or surprised. in fact, it was so funny that i kept on chuckling days after i saw the movie. it's so silly!anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. it's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. the best thing i could say about this film is the cinematography, which i actually liked. but aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus, except that it's unintentionally hilarious.

"the incubus" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous overtones, a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes - was that character really meant to be so "wacko"?). not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be, but not particularly successful, either. (*1/2)

i rented this back in the 80's and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen. this isn't one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". this isn't one of those "it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movies. it wasn't even one of those "what the heck was that?" movies. i can't recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. when it was over, i was angry that i had wasted the time.i've seen plenty of movies i didn't understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. the incubus has none.i actually contemplated not making a comment on this "piece" for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity, but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.

years ago a movie going friend and i went to see a horror film that we thought would be good because it starred john cassavetes. for the uninitiated, john cassavettes was an actor, screen writer and director (married to actress gena rowlands), nominated for oscars three times, who wrote and directed a variety of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to keep himself afloat. up until seeing the incubus, we did not understand that john cassavetes income was made from any movie that was offered to him. had we known what the film was about before seeing it we may have avoided altogether. but we did not walk out. at the time, my friend and i jokingly indicated it was the worst movie ever made. now frankly, this is not true. i have seen many poorly made films on friday nights on cinemax (did i just say that out loud?) that are far worse than the incubus. almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus. certainly santa claus conquers the martians is a worse movie than the incubus. however, i have since consistently used the incubus as a threshold below which i do not want to fall. when talking to this friend about a movie i may have seen i will always remark that it was better (or worse) than the incubus.http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/

you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, and "the incubus" is a dreadful, worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills. actually, observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction, one can hardly blame him. the movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in. somehow, the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene, and cassavetes seems visibly p.o.'ed at times. the incubus itself, which doesn't show up until the last scene, is a well-done creation, but it's not worth waiting for.1/10

seriously, i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women. he, john cassavetes of "rosemary's baby", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. that being said, "incubus" is an ultimately strange horror effort. it isn't necessarily awful  although it isn't very good, neither  but just plain weird. the muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters. none of these characters, especially not the main ones, come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets. the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he's a suspect himself, the town's sheriff (john ireland) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district, the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens (an old witch and her grandson) are just plain spooky. all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns' women reproducing organs. the sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling. basically these are very positive factors in a horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for "incubus" to be a really good film. also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through (like footage of a bruce dickinson concert!) and the usually very reliable john hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable. the final shot is effectively nightmarish, though. for me personally, "incubus" was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded genre fanatics.

based on ray russell's dark bestseller, this john (watcher in the woods) hough-directed bust has little going for it.though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and "characters".the "incubus" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.john cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage.the script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid big-schlong-on-the-loose exercise.

a young couple mandy pullman (mitch martin) and roy seeley (matt birman) are relaxing on a beach in the small town of galen. they decide to start playing practical jokes on each other. mandy hides in an old run down cabin, she is attacked and raped by an unknown assailant. roy tries to help her after hearing her screams but is killed. dr. sam cordell (john cassavetes) and his daughter jenny (erin flannery) are both new to galen after the death of sam's wife. sam is called into action by police chief hank walden (john ireland) when mandy and roy are found. he performs the autopsy on roy and treats mandy for her horrific injuries. soon after a curator at the local museum named carolyn davis (denise furgusson) is also attacked and raped. a local journalist named laura kincaid (kerrie keane) reports the events and suggests to sam that a similar string of rapes and murders occurred in the town 30 years earlier. more rapes and murders occur. meanwhile jenny's boyfriend tim galen (duncan macintosh) has been having strange dreams and nightmares and is convinced that he has something to do with the horrific acts. tim's story and digging into the towns past makes sam become convinced of the existence of a creature known as an incubus - a shape-shifting demonic entity that exists only to reproduce! directed by john hough this is one seriously dull horror film. the script by george franklin based on the novel by ray russell is slow to say the least. nothing interesting or exciting happens and it finishes with one of the most boring none event of a twist ending i've ever seen and frustratingly it just finishes suddenly. as the story plods along at a snails pace there are a few rapes, but none are shown on screen. there is only one gore scene in the entire film too. the monster itself is only shown at the very end and has all of three short scenes. everything about this film production-wise is very static and flat, the film has no energy or pace. the acting is dull and you don't feel or care for anyone. check out the scene in the autopsy room where you can clearly see the boom mike at the top of the screen on several occasions. the type of rubbish horror film making that you'll forget within a day. a real waste of time, don't bother.

for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings... the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies/funny situations again and again and again. it is to predictable. it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.i like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience....

stephen king adaptation (scripted by king himself) in which a young family, newcomers to rural maine, find out about the pet cemetery close to their home. the father (dale midkiff) then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right.below average "horror" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being midkiff's worthless performance. it gets a little better toward the end, with genuinely disturbing finale. in point of fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, which is why i can't completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable. decent supporting performances by fred gwynne, as the wise old aged neighbor, and brad greenquist, as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film.king has his usual cameo as the minister.followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert (is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since?).4/10

"indian burial ground": if those three words appear anywhere in a real-estate listing, look for a different neighborhood. a young couple with a young daughter and a toddler-age son move into a maine house adjacent to a pet cemetery--and, after a l-o-o-o-ng hike, an ancient indian burial ground. seems the indian ground can bring fido or fluffy back from the dead--if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet. it can do the same for dead people--if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house.throw in a busy two-lane blacktop, speeding big rigs, a well-meaning (if somewhat dim) old neighbor, and one kid who really doesn't get enough supervision, and i think you can figure out what happens from there--an over-the-top, illogical mess, which, in all fairness, does offer up a few scares.well, there are worse stephen king adaptations (such as "maximum overdrive," which king also directed). but there are far better ones, too (such as "salem's lot," "the dead zone," and both versions of "the shining").

fot the most part, this movie feels like a "made-for-tv" effort. the direction is ham-fisted, the acting (with the exception of fred gwynne) is overwrought and soapy. denise crosby, particularly, delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card. only one thing makes this film worth watching, and that is once gage comes back from the "semetary." there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone, and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason. it is absolutely bone-chilling. this film only does one thing right, but it knocks that one thing right out of the park. worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so.

pet sematary , though a nice 80's horror movie, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati. it's clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie zeder was made before king wrote the book)the cat, the ground, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiary , but, being stephen kind a famous american writer , it's totally normal that he can get away with this , it's obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no -budget (and in part, it's crap itself ... ) but the original idea, i repeat it, it's italian director avatilet the world know

stephen king is generally known for the morbid, and that's fine, but this story is too morbid. some movies, by the end you feel sad for the characters or the situations they were put through...here you just feel depressed. the movie has a nice feel to it (at first), with the family moving to the country, and creepy old fred gwyne greeting and warning them of the pet cemetery, but this plot leads nowhere. it starts with so much potential, but by the end, it loses the potential to be a good horror movie, and becomes corny, extremely stupid, and ultimately depressing.louis (dale midkoff), his wife rachel (denise crosby), their kids ellie and gage, and their cat move to a new home in maine. they are warned by the loony farmer neighbor jud (fred gwyne) about the local pet cemetery and how it is cursed. louis thinks nothing of this and everything's fine until the family cat is killed. he bury's it in the cursed cemetery and it comes back to life, constantly hissing at the family and wanting to be left alone. one day, infant gage runs out in the road and is run over and killed by a truck, and louis knows he must bury him in the cemetery. when gage comes back to life, he is changed and wants to murder.with many of stephen king's works that don't translate well into films, i blame the directors and screenwriters. in this case, mr. king was the screenwriter, but i'm going to blame him for his awful story. by the end it's so pointless, and though unfunny, the premise is laughable. a little boy comes back from the dead and manages to kill people with what looks like a tiny scalpel, and not only that, but he manages to lift their bodies and in one case, carry a body from the ground to the attic!(?) i know this isn't set in reality but seriously, how stupid can this get? the scene where louis injects his deceased, now living again cat to kill it is strangely sad, because the cat did not deserve this. all it did was go around minding it's own business and he killed it. the scene where he injects his own infant son is almost unbearable. not unbearably sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think of. after being injected gage staggers drunkenly around before falling down dead....why did they need to make a movie ending with the death of an infant? but...even worse, the actual ending of them film involving louis burying someone else (not going to give away who) in the cemetery after gage kills them....what did he expect? why did mr. king write this horrible story and why was it made into a movie? it's depressing and pointless!my rating: * out of ****. 90 mins. r for violence.

now, i haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so i'm not going to go down that path here.but i have some time ago learnt that stephen king movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. this was not one of them. it started well enough, and for once i'm not going to complain about the acting, although fred gwynne was as usual wonderful.. also i will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...but there was one consistent point that i couldn't help but get annoyed with. and that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. the moments i refer to are thus: there is a tiny zombie running around the house. you suspect it is under the bed. do you (a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or (b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.i know, let's go with (a). i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. blehfun enough film though... just not very scary.

a family with dad louis (dale midkiff), mom rachel (denise crosby), 10 year old eileen (blaze berdalh and about 3 year old gage (miko hughes) move to this beautiful house in maine--seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! the neighbor across the way (the wonderful fred gwynne) makes them feel at home...and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets. but a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life...but the dead come back in a nasty mood.""definite spoilers** the novel by stephen king was good--it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened. this movie jettisons all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence. animals are killed on camera (i know it's faked but it's still repulsive); a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral (in a totally sick scene); he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom (i do wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghostly jogger (don't ask) tries to help the family for no reason...the movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face. it just goes out of its way to shock you. **end spoilers**acting is no help. midkiff is just dreadful as the father--he's handsome and buff but totally blank. crosby isn't much better. the two kids are just annoying. only gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting. this picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things (especially midkiff at the end). this movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. i saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what i saw. a sick repulsive horror film. a 1 all the way.when you think it's all over and can't get worse the ramones sing a title song!!!!!! ("i don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery"). truly beyond belief.

jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines.but then in the third episode he says that when the europeans in south africa got too far north they ran into zulu people and other tribes that *herded cattle and planted crops*. so what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to north america by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. well, if 150 europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military south africans can defeat 10,000 zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then i think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. with or without germs, we were going to succeed.he says malaria stopped europeans from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of europeans while not affecting africans. (i'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say.) then at the end he says today malaria is killing thousands of africans and that is why they can't catch up with us. so which is it, jared? did malaria help the africans by halting eurpeans or hurt them? and how come europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? he also seems far too eager to say that the reasons europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. at times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe europeans were successful because they worked for it. it's sad watch this obvious neo-marxist contort reality to try to prove his point.

this film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of "guns, germs and steel", explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe.the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. there are completely useless scenes of: professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars, professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly, professor jared diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly. was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of "professor jared diamond?". this part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital. none of this helps me understand his theory of "guns, germs and steel." btw, "guns, germs and steel" is said about 100 times. "can the europeans guns, germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? stay tuned and find out!" when he finally gets down to business, his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. do i really need a professor to convince me of this? the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin.in the end, i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-europeans are as capable as europeans. if i'm not a racist, i already know this. if i'm a racist, jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.i don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. kids may enjoy this more than i, though. i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary.

first of all; it's very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns, germs and steel. the same tried to do marxists from economical positions.the reason of western success can't be just dumb luck, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. we see, that all around the world any advantages and bonuses are complete useless if they aren't wisely managed. in the japan there isn't huge natural resources, but japan is one of the top world economies, the same situation in singapore, but in nigeria, country with rich oil resources, there are only middle-low success. both of this nations had and still have access to western technology and inventions, but why such gap? in the end of movie daimond declared, that it's very important to understand factors of guns, germs and steel, to understand. maybe the main factor of world's difference is not geography, but people ability to understand and use things? the mental ability to understand. and in this case geography is only subordinated.

i've seen (far too) many flicks from this company - this one is about middle of the pack. one the good side, its a bit more stylized and under control than some of their fare - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to story (for what its worth). many of their titles, like sexy sixth sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility. on the other side, i found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks (like vampire vixens, gladiator eroticus, spiderbabe or mistress frankenstein).misty mundae is always a 10 on the peter meter, as is darian caine. i found barbara joyce hot in a school-marm kinda way, and ruby larocca a sexy little hottie.watch this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porn. don't waste your time wanting to check the story - you've got better things to do w/ your life. it is not a movie, it's pure t&a, but not bad by that standard.

i really looked forward to seeing nana after seeing renoir amazing debut work, whirlpool of fate. i had read that nana was generally considered his best silent film so i had high hopes. sadly this felt like a huge step backwards.catherine hessling is the main problem with this film. her acting is over the top, even for a silent film. her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens, not the late 20s. she usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains. it was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. there was nothing charming about her at all.the film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was uninteresting (aside from a shot of a horse race) and the editing was dull. the story reminded me of pabst's pandora's box. it is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films. pandora's box simply scores on every level where nana fails.this film is only for renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs.

how many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror's reflection? it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy, poorly done film. there were only two freaky moments to appreciate....when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz. cup i was drawing it from. the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons. there was the friendly, aged sheriff. there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl. lots'o'characters with no development. the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning. but rather than explore the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other. when they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together....with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there. oh...and the eerie sounds were also overdone. you know what i mean....creaking doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. ooooohhhh. haven't seen that before. again, you'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again. note to director: a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film. think these things out before calling out "it's a wrap!"

for all of the hype about this film, i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think. and, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few "old time" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. where dark remains fails, however, is in its climax. the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body. the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma? - was not elucidated upon! the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, i felt very cheated. what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending.

i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake. even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average. "dark remains" is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you. the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter-webbed which even later are not tied together. a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed. they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what... the house is haunted, kind of. from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed (the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good). ok, then... woman sees ghost of daughter, other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear, man tries to solve secret of houses past, woman gets depressed, strange neighbors appear. its pretty much all been there, but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the twist. there is no twist, you are just confused by a haunted house history story, the strange neighbor, a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo-idea reminding me a lot of "the shutter". the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick, of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music. to make it short... dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere.too many stories mushed together which just don't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie. and beside... please never use abandoned prisons again. its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all. "hey, there is this creepy prison uphill, lets shoot there". i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this.

granted, i'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is, but a well put together, clever flick is worth the time. my quibbles, in brief:- dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character.- unconvincing acting.- storyline never really caught fire.the writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films, tossed into a kettle, simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess, al'dente.long and short, while not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix rentals.

dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards.the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands. first, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted.as the movie goes on, the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. however, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once.just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here.i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor.the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them.the direction is uninspired. the inspiration from j-horror movies such as ringu, the grudge and one missed call is evident. unfortunately, the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j-horror. j-horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. there is no humour or tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the "jump scares" used in hollywood movies.the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi. the homage to j-horror could have been well intended. unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed "scares" on the screen. the make-up effects of the "ghosts" weren't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie.i couldn't give away the ending even if i wanted to. i simply couldn't understand it. all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax.what remains? the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. the movie is a chore to sit through. thankfully, the pain ends after an hour and a half. however, most would probably switch off long before the end.there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the "f-word" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. this is what the 2 stars are for.those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house, the changeling or the j-horror sub-genre.if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget "r-rated" horror movie about ghosts, watch death of a ghost hunter. it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store.i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague.

if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet-bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. trust me: you will be bored! people of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). but that's not enough: they also click constantly "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones.the movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. believe me now! if not, you will believe me later!brian avenet-bradley might be quite a good business man. otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (okay, they are cheap, but nevertheless.) but as a creative person, he is a complete failure.

i'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie. whilst it's not the worst i've seen, it certainly isn't good.a weak script, weak actors, and weak directing. even if they can't afford big name cast, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance. the story was a cliché and poorly scripted. the special effects were minimal. the "suspense" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.to be fair, dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors' episodes. but not quite on par with quality movies yet. dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a poorly made one. as for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.

okay. look- i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films. you know, the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it? well, i got got again. and i'm getting' pretty tired of it. but i digress. it's pretty simple. it sucked(i know, rather juvenile) but it did. andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing, why oh why did the lead actress have to be so unnattractive?distractingly so if i may add. and the scowl she used convey unresolved pain/grief over the death of her daughter did little help. i mean, jesus.. oh, but the crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee was pretty neat...

give me my money back! give me my life back! give me a bit of credit. this movie was vomit worthy. useless and time consuming. what a waste of energy and totally pointless. okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but, give us a break! next time just give me the money and let me spend it. lost child, mothers remorse, blamed husband! cliché yes~! get a life! sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. i would rather watch eggs cook! no real explanation to why this happened. prison? why? loss? obvious but why? acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a wage? how much did this movie make? well this silly fool hired a copy. enough said

grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter, discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place, restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide. julie pyke(cheri christian)blames husband allen(greg thompson)for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it. julie remains in a zombie state, eliciting next to no emotion, remote and numb, only photographing a nearby abandoned prison, finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell. though allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary, julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right. a local handyman, jim payne(scott hodges), a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the pykes. meanwhile the neighbors who sold the pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well, alcoholic mr booth's abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him. allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin, attempting to unravel the mystery about the place.plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable. cheri christian remains so vacuous and lost, it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight. the acting, as is often mentioned, remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to. i guess it's supposed to be this way, under their circumstances, but the trouble i had was never being able to properly embrace the pykes due to their constant state of aloofness. cheri comes off as cold and detached, as i figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way, but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which i just never could. i think the right performers, even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil, can grab the hearts of their viewers, if a humanity reaches out to us..in this movie's case, the leads are unable to do so, for whatever reason. it could've been me, i don't know. i wanted to care for them, but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings. anyway, as the film continues, allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again. jim, the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the pykes, becomes a vital threat. the ghosts remain a central part of the movie, their presence, particularly jim's mother, established throughout, off in the distance. the finale reveals all of them as allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart jim's mission. i had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters.

acting was weak, but in a horror flick, i can live with that if the story is good. it wasn't. the initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's adoration of kids. ok, fine. fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. i like the revelation of the ghosts. ok, cool--this will be a supernatural kinda horror story, with rotting things partly in our world partly in...where ever. then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds--is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? is there an evil force trying to attack them indirectly--make people do awful things they wouldn't really do? oh, wait, no, maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder? ok, hold on--maybe it's really just one little mentally tangled "delbert"-style redneck boy who misses his mommy and is on some kind of spree like a k-tel norman bates knock off? oh, yeah--extra points off: the only black character seems to be the grandson of an "our gang" pullman porter. the actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue, but the fact is, his purpose is "y'all done betta get outa heah, boss!" at least they wrote him smart enough to gtf outta there. the bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy, as was the chick in the shower. those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. the problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a bite of steak, a bite of chocolate and a bite of a gummi bear. each is great on it's own, but mixed up? bleah! such potential. wasted.

this film is too skeletal. it's a fairly low-budget film (i hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. they needed filler...) i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do. 4/10.

dakota (1988) was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle. this film is similar to the later released film harley. there are a few differences but they're both the same. i don't know which one came first. i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life. but they both are troubled "kids" who are trying to turn there lives around. instead of bikes this one involves horses. they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. if you're a serious l.d.p. fan then i recommend that you watch them both. you get some extreme mugging and posturing from l.d.p. if you're game then go for it.not recommended, except for l.d.p. fans!!!

oh it really really is. i've seen films that i disliked more, due to whatever reason, but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making. it even fails to fail at film making, in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do. it's not the film i like the least, but it is the very worst film i've ever seen.the acting is the first thing that strikes you. i've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography. in fact i've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this. it really is awful.technically, it's terrible. the camera-work is amateurish. the editing is nonsensical. i presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there's a lot of them) has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods (and there's a lot of them too) is actually dubbed from a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe.the plot is nonsensical, as many have pointed out. i'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos.speaking of vampire mythos, the writer had evidently read carmilla, or at very least seen the vampire lovers. i'm not sure how i feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel i'm very fond of; or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material. at very least 'the general' is an insult to peter cushing though.it gets two stars however, merely because i can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has, or at least purports to have, both vampires and zombies in it. incidentally i watched lifeforce (another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed film itself, really comes out a masterpiece compared to this.so in the end, this is not a film so bad it's good, or so bad it's in any way enjoyable, even drunk. it's just a mess, and worth no-one's time watching.

this is probably the best horror film made since ed wood died. i can't spoil the ending, because i have absolutely no idea what happened. i'll try my best, though. there are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. sound confusing? it's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. there's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. there are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. the upside? both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. the special effects are simply mind-boggling (i particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). everyone has a really silly canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. well worth the price of rental. we laughed until we cried.

first off i must stress how rare it is that i take the time to comment on a movie that i have seen, it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how i felt about a film. that said, of the hundreds of movies i have watched i have seen some of the most brilliant, shawshank, the scariest, the woman in black, the funniest, shark attack iii: megaladon, and now the worst: vampires vs. zombies.the first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny! for those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny, look elsewhere. it is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant, with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into. that said, there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world. this is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more "artsy" methods to creating a film, this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies.this movie suffers from the over used saying "i don't know where to start." truly everything about this movie is broken. from the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as vampires vs. zombies. some of the following problems are; 1. scene misfires- it's clear that the director, the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page. in one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car. you are expecting the person inside to get out, but there is a, and this is no exaggeration, 10 second, at least, delay between the camera comes on and the director says "action" to where anything happens on screen. the viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound, no movement, just the stereotypical "dead air" that radio or tv commentators dread. where was the editing? 2. acting- a forgivable offense in most cases, you can't expect a movie like this to have oscar winners after all, but vampires vs. zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level. these "actors" were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools. my only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from resident evil on playstation. but that acting was even better.3- story- wait, what? story? again you can't expect this to be the greatest story ever told, but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative? why the vampires? who are the characters? who are the bad guys? are there good guys? why all the lesbians? but most importantly, what's the deal with the zombies? if you have seen this movie then you will understand what i mean, but to those who haven't i'll be plain, there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it. it was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end.there's so much more, but i hope i've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie.

i really have no idea how to comment on this movie. the special effects were lackluster, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all, it was on the back of the box. i don't think i can remember a movie being this bad in a long time, and i'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ;) even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera.i was pretty much let down by the overall "zombie" effect. since apparently in this movie, zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there, and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom), the zombie-movie genre isn't even a factor until the end. even then, a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie.on to the vampires: apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is ok by me. i'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight, or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road, still holding his gun with a stake through his heart, just waiting for the queen of the vampires to flick it all the way through. the last segment in the old nunnery made no sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire "do you think we did the right thing?" by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie, that about put it over the top.the acting and special effects were at an all-time low also. you could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the general. speaking of the general, where did they find this kenny rogers look-alike anyways? no idea what he was the general of, aside of generally confusing and misplaced.all in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3. just my $0.02.

vampires vs. zombies wasn't the original title. it was actually... nasty lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies getting hit by cars: special guest appearances by bob the lesbian gypsie-witch and her dog, random woman with special powers and the catholic school girl short skirt zombie choir. also on the box: warning: no plot- only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie.seriously though, i love bad movies. i love vampires. i love zombies. hell, i even enjoy the lesbians. this movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horrendous (i mean really bad) dialogue, and random stuff and people that have nothing to do with anything (or do they... i didn't know what in the world was going on). oh, and i can't forget the green oatmeal 'zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). any way, the result was this excruciatingly bad film, if you could even call it that. was the end supposed to not make sense? the vampire was really nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? where were the vampires vs. zombies? hell, where were the vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires. whatever. don't ever rent or buy this movie. if you are really curious... okay, i'll understand. seriously, even lovers of bad movies won't be able to stand this one. it should be number 1 on the bottom 100.

ok, i knew this would be a back alley f-film (well below b-film standards) going into it, so i thought, "man, i could use a good laugh, so let's see some nether-beings kill each other." well, what i got could have been found at your local "love toy" store. random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, and no plot.for example, one scene in particular i remember (for its sheer stupidity only; i've seen better porn on abc) is where the two main characters (i can't remember their names offhand...great movie, huh?) are driving along, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped:driver: "let's pull over, i'm tired. you want to take over?" passenger: "sure, i can drive for a while." (once pulled over, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boobs) passenger: "what are you doing? i'm not like that!" driver: "it's ok, everyone does it sometime." passenger: "ok then." (proceed to take off shirts, fondle, kiss, and perform fellatio)now, last time i checked, horror films were not in the porn section of hollywood video (unless you're into s&m, then you go elsewhere), and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at blockbuster. don't get me wrong; i'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but i only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if i'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, as this one i rented was at one of the two retailers i named (and probably at the other too if i went and looked).worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. if i could give it a 0, i would, but i can only give it a * of 10.

yes, this movie is bad. what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! in the entire movie, zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice. on top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire. one might argue they were trying to "tone it down" or make it "realistic," but it ends up just boring. more than half of this movie takes place in a car. the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. however, i will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). i'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). "worse than scarecrow slayer."

a film written and directed by neil young, "greendale" is little more than an 87-minute music video set to a doxen or so of the songwriter's works. in lieu of dialogue, the film relies exclusively on young's lyrics, which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary, to tell the "story" while actors act out the scenes.given the hammy performances and the shoddy graininess of the picture, the effect is the equivalent of young blowing up some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. although there is allegedly a "story" running through the film, we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film, the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting. all we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent narrative while young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. the whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self-indulgence. "greendale" gives off-hollywood, low budget movie-making a bad name.

i'm a big mark for the music of neil young, and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt-indie press circles, hit the first showing of greendale i could find. my excitement was short-lived, as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed.neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. not the best way to craft a story. no character really has an arc, and when "significant" events do happen, the viewer doesn't cared, because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. the film is all song, and to that end, the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done, and is grating on the nerves after that. it doesn't feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome.terrible acting, with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. poor lighting at times. the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast, but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it. an alright soundtrack, but nothing i'm quick to buy. a bad film.

i had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of 2004's worst films back to back this morning: first, the incoherent cgi-driven emptiness of the chronicles of riddick, and then, the embarrassing vanity project known as greendale. one cost multimillions and the other cost pennies, but they're both bad. really, really bad. up front i should state i'm not the world's biggest neil young fan, but he has contributed his share of classic tunes: from buffalo springfield (whose best recordings were young compositions) to rust never sleeps, harvest, and mirror ball, the man has penned some really great songs. sadly, there are no great songs in greendale, and precious few good ones, and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering. completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic, greendale is best left forgotten. buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to young's bank account.

i saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as greendale in the movie, which is the only reason i went to see it. another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away. his editorial comment in his forward is a good summary:"yuk."unless you're a neil young fan or live in/near "greendale" (if the latter you know the real name), skip this movie. it's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker. it has no discernible plot, the music is merely ok, and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be.i don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away.i'd give this a 1.5/10, but that's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie. it wasn't worth the $6. i could rent a video camera and drive around "greendale" and make a better movie myself.if you want to see a *good* environmental-message movie with no plot, go rent koyaanisqatsi.

i have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. this movie made me angrier and angrier as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. now, after i've seen it, i understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ("the highway belongs to me...me!"), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the "plot", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. blech.

in this short an urban man and his wife have their weird lives set akimbo when the man takes to wearing an old red pants suit of his mother in law's.i kept watching this hoping that i could see why it had been made, or why the other reviewers found it funny. for me it was a total waste of time.not everyone's tastes are the same but this was clearly not to mine.

although the actors were good, specially fritzi haberland as the blind lilly, the film script is obsessively pretentious and completely arbitrary. a famous theatre director (hilmir snær guðnason), becoming blind after a car accident, is on the run for himself and his destiny. lilly, being sightless since her birth, is teacher for blind persons, and wants to make him "seeing" again. (blind persons are seeing with their fingers, nose and ears.) here this movie is becoming a roadmovie; and the longer the road becomes, the closer their relation develops, which was predictable since the beginning of the film. the theatre director is on the road to his mother (jenny gröllmann). his mother is living somewhere in russia on the sea and making artistic installations - of course, what should she do other! - and she is still living, because she is waiting his son, to die. my god! this are destinies!finally the son arrived! mum is celebrating a big party! at the beach. wind is blowing and a pianist is playing on a real piano in the middle of a dune. yes, they are celebrating her farewell. the son arrives just in time. mother can finally swallow the pills administered by a pretty nurse. now a great artist can die in the arms of her great artist son, speaking sad contemplations about live in perfect german, while the son is answering with a rough accent. because the son is unable to see, he is not falling in love to the nurse, - the film script would have become also too complicate! - but is looking for lilly on the way back to home.parallel to this roadmovie the sister of lilly, staying at home is asking a gawky schoolmate to deflower her, who has first to booze himself to courage. the occasion is favourable. because mum (tina engel) is on journey together with the lover of lilly, paul (harald schrott). they are after lilly, to bring her back. paul and the mother of lilly are not falling in love, because the film script would have become too complicate. the film script missed to make out of paul something exceptional too. i would suggest an architect or a pianist, or course a famous one! when they finally find lilly, they want to convince her, to come back to paul, because he has two eyes to see and is able to care for her. but lilly felt in love to his pupil, the theatre director; did i mention, that he was even a famous theatre director?this is german film art! as you may see in this pretentious production, that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good films, because they subsidy just such kind of pseudo intellectual films. this film is really embarrassing. i have the impression, that the film script has been cobbled together from some highbrows in coffee shops and restaurants. everybody is entitled to contribute with an idea. probably also til schweiger has contributed with some intellectual flash of wit, being a co-producer. i was reminded by this film script to an other german film of absolute painfulness: "barfuss" - already the spelling of the title is not right! "barfuss" dvd cover writes proudly: "a til schweiger film". this film got also subsidies of filmstiftung nrw, filmförderung hamburg and the ffa.please don't spoil your time with this film! there are really good films in germany. watch out for film directors like marcus h. rosenmüller, joseph vilsmaier, hans steinbichler, hans-christian schmid, faith akin ...

this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. however, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there.one unbelievable event followed the next (russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible (why does she still follow him after they got off the ship? why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? and what was the story with the younger sister about?). still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable.the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential. as i said, the idea of the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. so this could have been a really good film... but it wasn't.

given the people involved, it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull. the writer, david ward, wrote the amazing caper film "the sting" two years later, jane fonda had just won an academy award for klute, and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in films like "klute," "start the revolution without me," and "kelly's heroes." plotwise, the movie is a caper tale, with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist. at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the nbc television show "saturday night" would do so well two years later. the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have. it is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other.the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda. her "iris caine" is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic bree daniels prostitute character in "klute" yet, one doesn't believe her for a moment. it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching. it is as terrible a performance as her performance in "klute" was terrific. it would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. it suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors.

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. not just the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. the dialog sounds like someone reading the news.this is rated as comedy/drama/romance, it's not of those things ! it's a little action, that's it. there's really no comedy and drama at all.if you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you. i would not recommend it at all. pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better. this is pretty much a action/crime movie. the actions scenes sucked, and crime story part of it was very predictable.if you are not really interested in a good story, or good acting. and you simply want to look at a 'foreign' film for the appeal of being foreign. then this might be for you.

unbelievably bad acting, a no good, unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least: adrenaline is everything a movie should not be.georgina verbaan (a so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her english classes) plays rich girl freya, who has the habit of 'thrill-seeking'. which basicly is doing dangerous stunts, break stuff and annoy people. and not in a fun jackass way. then there's dracko (rivas). he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side. then there's freya's dad (lockyer), who plays a dubious role as well. and, in the end, we got jason (debutant fyall), the boyfriend of freya.one day, freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we, the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable, and the story doesn't make any sense.why was this even made? 2/10.

i caught this cuban film at at an arthouse film club. it was shown shortly after the magisterial 1935 silly symphony cartoon where the isle of symphony is reconciled with the isle of jazz. what with the recently deceased ruben gonzalez piped through speakers in this old cinema-ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from peeling stucco rocaille motifs, the scene was set for a riproaring celebration of engaged filmmaking and synchronised hissing at the idiocies of helms-burton. but then the film started. and the cinema's peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on-screen.the storyline of nada mas promises much. carla is a bored envelope-stamper at a cuban post office. her only escape from an altogether humdrum existence is to purloin letters and rewrite them, transforming basic interpersonal grunts into brontëan outbursts of breathless emotion. cue numerous shots of photogenic cubans gushing with joy, grief, pity, terror and the like.the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless excursions into film-school artiness, latino caricature, marx brothers slapstick and even - during a particularly underwhelming editing trick - the celluloid scratching of a schoolkid defacement onto a character's face.unidimensional characters abound. cunda, the boss at the post office, is a humourless dominatrix-nosferatu. her boss-eyed accomplice, concha, variously points fingers, eavesdrops and screeches. cesar, the metalhead dolt and romantic interest, reveals hidden writing talent when carla departs for miami. a chase scene (in oh-so-hilarious fast-forward) is thrown in for good measure. all this would be fine in a mortadello and filemon comic strip, but in a black-and-white zero-fx flick with highbrow pretensions, ahem.nada mas attempts to straddle the stile somewhere between the 'quirky-heroine-matchmakes-strangers' of amelie and the 'poetry-as-great-redeemer' theme of il postino. like amelie, its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who combats impending spinsterdom by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. and like il postino, the film does not flinch from sustained recitals of poetry and a postman on a bicycle takes a romantic lead. unfortunately, nada mas fails to capture the lushness and transcendence of either film.there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late-night tv stupor. the first is the opening overhead shot of carla on a checker-tiled floor, which cuts to the crossword puzzle she is working on. the second is to see nada mas as a cautionary example: our post buena vista social club obsession with cuban artistic output can often blinker us into accepting any dross that features a bongo on the soundtrack. this film should not have merited a global release - films such as waiting list and guantanamera cover similar thematic territory far more successfully.

very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci, who tries, but can not save the poor structure, dialogue, direction, or talent of our leading man.pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has, is its quirky side characters. but without a realistic backdrop, such characters are pointless.nothing to see here, keep moving...

of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list (devil hunter, bloody moon and women behind bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore, a gratuitous rape scene, and loads of nudity.gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big, naked, bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).employed by laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom, brave mercenary peter weston (al cliver) and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island, but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. during the confusion, laura escapes into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives, who offer her up to their god.franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore, murky cinematography, rapid zooms, numerous crotch shots, out of focus imagery, awful sound effects, and ham-fisted editing. the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (it took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing), and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry.

pointless, humourless drivel.....meant to be a comedy; but not one laugh in the whole film. gratuitous violence often with guns. what kind of warped mentality can either make or say this is a good film?! 1 out of 10.

what a horrible comedy. totally lame. the supposed "humor" was simple and stupid. stanly tucci (a great actor) had the only parts worth chuckling at. and he was tied up and gagged at the time. don't waste your time with this one. it deserves a 0/10.

...am i missing something here??? "unexpected plot developments"? "plot twisting with subversive glee"? are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself (in an now-obvious sub(un)conscious bout of sadomasochism)...i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker...this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved...quick question: did sir stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs-up to kate c.? if so, then it must be the same spielberg who greenlighted "howard the duck"...don't give me that, "it was a hit play" crap--i'm guessing mssr. reddin ain't too pleased ...the dvd cover promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story..." story!!story?? it's crap like this that make old bobby mckee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses...sundance??berlin??toronto?? i have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than arquette's negatively-dimensional portrayal of anguished loss...and, talk about deux ex machina for mr. stanley t.; thank god, just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops! and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer...what!!! up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against arquette and his "hidden millions"...no, mrs. spielberg, you don't escape unscathed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with the "athlete's foot in my crotch" gag??? are you worse in this or "just cause"?? i dunno...hey film lovers: why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka)...and take e. dunsky with you....

what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company turns, almost instantaneously, into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery. david arquette and the great stanley tucci try mightily to make this train wreck watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible.what, for instance, causes gale to turn suddenly from a sweet motherly figure into a drunken shrew at tommy's parents house? why would heinrich, although admittedly a sleezebag, want to destroy the business to which he devotes his life, by robbing and possibly murdering his customers? why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that heinrich could be a murderer (based almost entirely on a dream), and even if that were believable, why wouldn't he go to the police? and why didn't gale activate the alarm when she got home, especially after scolding howie about it being off? of course, all of these events are necessary for the plot (and i use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy. but everything, from howie's description of his date rape, to the coroner's misidentification of gale, to the final "joke" about gale and howie still being dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else.i checked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there's nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.

david arquette is a young and naive home security alarmsalesman taken under the wing of stanley tucci. arquette is agolden boy, scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow katecapshaw and her dopey son ryan reynolds. things are goingwell for arquette, he is appearing in commercials for the securityfirm and he is falling in love with capshaw.then tucci and his right hand woman mary mccormack let him inon a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of theirclients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buysecurity systems from the firm. arquette decides not to getinvolved, taking capshaw to meet his family, and going through lifewith a goofy smile on his face. then, someone breaks intocapshaw's home and murders her and her son. arquette suspects tucci, and sets a series of traps, resulting in a gun to hisboss' head as tucci pleads his innocence.based on a stage play, "the alarmist" is not opened up well. thescenes where arquette takes the capshaw to meet his parentsare badly played and completely unfunny. they are also out of linewith the character capshaw is playing, as she gets drunk and tellssexually explicit stories to arquette's mom michael learned. otherthan these scenes, capshaw is not given much to do, but shedoes a lot with the little she is given.stanley tucci, looking just like terry o'quinn, is a riot as thesecurity firm owner. he is a creep who really does not understandarquette's moral revulsion. however, when he turns into asniveling whiner after arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. marymccormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role, butshe mostly stands around and agrees with tucci. ryan reynoldsis too old to play a dumb teenager, but he is funny, especiallytelling his own explicit sexual story to arquette.the screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy toosoon. capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated,except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone canbreak into her house. capshaw and reynolds are in the film justto give arquette a reason to take revenge on tucci.arquette, who has proven he is a good actor, is awful here. herelies on the constipated mugging that got him through thoseat&t ads, and he is not a strong enough presence to build thisweak film around. actually, reynolds might have been a betterchoice in the role.dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will win an oscar soon.christophe beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir thisfilm tries to be, and it is really catchy on top of that.despite the pluses, arquette's failure as a lead and the script'sschizophrenic quality sinks the film. i do not recommend it.this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, some gore,strong profanity, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexualreferences, and adult situations.

the alarmist is so abysmally scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it. it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all, it borders on the brink of tedious. it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner. stay away!.

i was at this film's premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997. after the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (david arquette, to paraphrase dorothy parker, does not run the emotional gamut from a to b. he parks at a and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. at long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to "really make you think." unfortunately, what it makes you think is, "well, there's 90 minutes of my life i'm never getting back."

ghost town starts as kate barrett (catherine hickland) drives along an isolated desert road, her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching... deputy sheriff langley (frank luz) of riverton county is called in to investigate kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing. he finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her, unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk. langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town, much to his shock langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents & is run by the evil devlin (jimmie f. skaggs) who has kidnapped kate for reasons never explained & it's up to langley to rescue her & end the towns curse...the one & only directorial effort of richard governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & i didn't like it all that much. the script by duke sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect. have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there? well, neither have i but if i were to ask myself such a question i would find all the answers in ghost town because it's not very good. the two genres just don't mix that well. there are plenty of clichés, on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them, the shoot-outs in the main street, saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking corpses & a few violent kills. i was just very underwhelmed by it, i suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well. there are a few holes in the plot too, why did devlin kidnap kate? i know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway? we never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either, i mean what's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts? then there's the bit at the end where devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for langley to kill him a few seconds later, i mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place?director governor does alright, there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it. i wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't, there's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length. forget about any gore, there a few bloody gunshot wounds, an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that's it.i'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here, it's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else. credit where credit's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually. the acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards.ghost town is a strange film, i'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me. anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements. it's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good, worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it.

there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is "the pagemaster".i found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out, but this time, i found that the special effects are quite good. the plot is just "the neverending story" with a creativity-endectomy, but it's an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy. the animation is amazing, and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm. i'm giving it a grade of three as i *would* have given it a two (just for parody value) if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story-wise.

"i'm a cartoon!" "you're an illustration!" what does that suppose to mean?! this plot could not be worse as a boy, who's afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library. the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read, when a cheaper, and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts! even the talents of macaulay culkin(as the kid), christopher lloyd (as the so predictable "that he's a the page master" librarian), could save this pointless film from the dull plot. even the voices of whoopi goldberg, patrick stewart,(even) leonard nimoy, or the hollywood god of voices, frank welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever. i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies, because the bland animation makes the film worse, not improving the dull plot!

richard tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything. he doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents might happen to him. so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. in there the whole story takes place. he experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more. but the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like macaulay culkin could not make the story better than it is.

about 4 years ago, i liked this movie. i would watch it over and over and over. but now... i don't. actually, i think this movie would have been great for mystery science theater 3000. it has a bunch of comment-heavy actors (macaulay culkin, christopher lloyd, patrick stewart, whoopi goldberg), and a pretty cheesy plot. my favorite part is when culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "hey, tyler! where ya goin'? the moon??" also look out for the classic line, "do you have feeling in your toes?"on the other hand, it's better than "the good son".

the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.one of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. it doesn't look good, at least on vhs. once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often also, the characters come and go too quickly. for example, i would have liked to have seen more of "moby dick." when the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong. overall, just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years.

wow, i'm a huge henry viii/tudor era fan and, well, this was .... interesting. the only one i watched was the catherine of aragon one. and wow...just wow. i've seen bad acting before, but this reached new heights. when the actress who played catherine was umm.. crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times... many, many times .... funny, funny stuff. the only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing anne boleyn (i might be prejudiced though, i do have a slight obsession with anne boleyn, she was a really facinating woman, read up on her, it's worth it!) also, i have read a lot about the tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period, and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock.

having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80% of that time in complete disbelief, i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award, no problem. to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement. frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe. not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality (this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks')but the acting was dire. for those who pay to see this, i hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, i hope you give your money back. believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much, much better. go see.

i had a recent spectator experience with the perfect witness (2007) because the netflix computer recommendation engine suggested i watch this film. apparently, at some point, i told it how much i liked michael haneke's, benny's video. i don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over thomas c. dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse. just this kind of recommendation from the netflix computer intelligence, for me, had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007.having prefaced my response to the film that way, i'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and i really hate to do that because i think our boy, wes bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the us. i'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this.the perfect witness is about micky (wes bentley), who, about thirty, still lives with mom ("you're not drinkin' again area ya's?"), but he's a "filmmaker" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be johns in the seedy back alleys of philadelphia with his dvx 100b. out there, doing his private investigator-like drills, micky "inadvertently" video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder. baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films), micky approaches the assailant, james lemac (mark borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or "mac the knife" whichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police.the problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do. while both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone doesn't make a film bad. it's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little mac or pc. no film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course, ironically, it's a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes. also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest same guy who just now calls himself a "poet."spare me. "i'm an artist," "i'm a filmmaker." okay. please do, carry on with that shtick, cronnie. seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock. and go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a "creative" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down wes bentley's career. why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do, filmmaker guy. my guess is history will eventually have say something about that like, probably that's in not is good as you think it is. and yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man micky here in the perfect witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand. great.

another day stuck indoors, another film to watch. having finally completed my christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon, i had nowhere else to go to escape "the land that time forgot". or rather, i had nothing else to watch.doug mcclure, that bastion of leading-man actors, leads a handful of allied sailors sunk by a u-boat somewhere in the atlantic in 1916. capturing the u-boat (in a scene that defies logic and reason), they eventually find themselves on a strange island, apparently untouched by human hands. together, they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and neanderthals! can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that time forgot? despite being made few years before "star wars", these films are light-years apart in terms of special effects. the model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of gerry anderson's "stingray" and the creatures aren't much better either. when the t-rex (i'm assuming that's what it was) was killed, it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them - frozen in mid-walk and collapsing, arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that's been pushed over. granted, the sets aren't too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises (which all sound the same) do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole. characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves. in the end, i just didn't care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came, i was more relieved than entertained.costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bear-skin bikinis and loin cloths all round. and although it was fairly obvious from their actions, you wouldn't have known that some characters were german from their accents. the whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion, leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others. overall, this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where colin farrell is. i spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an irish accent and suspect facial hair. oh well. nothing particularly great here to see then, but just about ok if you're eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity.

this was recently on amc's vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh. i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "voyage to the earth's core" and "mysterious island". i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the pterdactyl's wings when they grasp "ogar" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in "people that time forgot". don't waste your time.

this isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.the manipulations aren't so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. what films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.this film lacks both. for a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. mcclure's hero is beyond "routine", and doesn't make much sense in any era.the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.a lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.

this is an amateur movie shot on video, not an "electrifying drama" as the dvd liner notes falsely boast. i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students. the bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around jakarta. this movie could have been made using a single video camera, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later. the editing is extremely rough. the final edit was probably done with two cameras, bouncing content back and forth, instead of with a proper editor. perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too? the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english, e.g., "where you go now?" to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous. if you're not scared away yet, this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor, with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta.

a short review but...avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened. it's full of cameos (stephen fry (3mins), jack dee (30 secs), the "philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense. whether the story just got lost in the edit i don't now but jeez...put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest!!!2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a morris minor car chase)

quite possibly. how francis veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when sticking to his native france), managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern. it's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit: it's genuinely physically painful to watch, such an endless parade of inept writing, acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers. for once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story. what were they thinking?

for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and "film-making". as a reminder to those that live here - locales include boulder creek, bonny doon, davenport, big basin. etc. the bank was the bc firehouse; chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236, empire grade rd, and hwy 1.production: jeffrey jones was the most approachable, matt broderick was above us all - even back then. as far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level. a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery.additional notes; joe's bar (jed's tavern in the film), original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw - the old erba's parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.

this is the weakest of the series, not much of a plot and a rather odd-looking wallace. but it's still pretty good, considering. a sign of greater things to come!6/10

star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits in this debut effort for nick park's beloved man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese.as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes, this w/g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows. the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box.admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, i've never actually been hugely into wallace & gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) the only one i've really enjoyed is the wrong trousers (and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.as technically impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this one lacks the emotional angle it's successors were to possess. that being said, it's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come. two stars, but a good two stars. **

this movie is another christian propaganda film in the line of the omega code. not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver. if you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and the way the gospel can change a life, than perhaps you may enjoy this movie. i say, save your money and rent the cross and the switchblade or the mission. when will christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words? it was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear (huh? criminals say bad words?) and flat characters i really could not relate to. also, it would've been great if the movie had shown some t&a. now that would be something i'd like to pay to see. who was the blockhead who compared this communion wafer-thin story of a movie with the boondock saints and the sting?

wow...i can't believe just how bad zombie doom (aka violent sh!t 3) really is. i'd heard the rumors, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. well, let me tell ya - it blows!!! the worst acting of any film ever made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore fx, no discernible plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on...three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the "tribe"...that's pretty much it...honestly - this is one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too. the budget had to be about $200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx (which actually may not have been a bad idea...). there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog. this film makes other no-budget outings like premutos: lord of the living dead look like titanic. some may rank zd in the "so-bad-it's-good" category - and i guess if you're really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3k-style - i guess it could be looked at that way. but not by me. i hated pretty much everything about it. if zombie doom or zombie 90 (which is equally appalling and is included as a "bonus" on the shock-o-rama release of zd) is indicative of andreas schnaas' other works - then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death. there is one amusing kung-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so i'll grant this one a very generous 3/10 - do yourself a favor and skip this.

i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this. i love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. but when you add ninga's, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, then at least it wasn't a total waste. you'd never know by watching it though. script? are you kidding. acting? i think even the trees were faking. cinematography? well, there must've been a camera there. period. i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie. such a total waste of time that i won't prolong it by commenting further.

i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is! i want my $3.99 back! words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap! the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths. the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder. i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera. the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot. the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped, then tried to put on a play in your garage. don't get me wrong...i wasn't expecting o'neil and i love zombie movies, but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable. avoid!

i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! this has to be the worst piece of monkey s@#t i have ever seen! i ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror, but i got bored and turned it off.let's see:the wardrobe: consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. the masks were made from what looks like tin foil. the gore: the gore was pretty good, i must give it that. but ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget movie. acting: was horrible! i didn't mind the dubbing. i find this humorous like in ittenbach's "premutos" (great movie). the fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.bottom line: don't watch any of schnaas's movies. there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. check premutos, house of blood, schramm and the nekromantiks.

ok, i like b movies...i know what b movies are supposed to represent. but this is just awful. i am amazed it got such a decent overall score. the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. don't get me wrong, gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me (like the anal "probe"...that was great!).i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. c'mon - rent a betacam at least, i've seen porn with better production values (and better acting as well).acting - sucked! but not in the troma or full moon sort of way.story - contrived! but thats what you get from films like these. very loose!sets & props - sucked! my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween.dubbing and dialogue - sucked! horrible voice acting (i shouldn't even call it acting) and every other word is "s**t" or "f**k".there are tons of good classic and b rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down. do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap!

i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it. if you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is ok. if there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. if that doesn't thrill you, then stay away.this movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. it's dubbed from german, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. this film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable.the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. they are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. i call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore. consider yourself warned.

karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. they capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) this one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (i may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). the horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and i suspect if i had been really drunk, some of it might have been slightly humorous....maybe. but as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. oh i don't know... 78 minutes. don't waste your time.my grade: f dvd extras: bonus movie: "zombie '90: extreme pestilence"; and trailers for other shock-o-rama released films

i couldn't believe i spent $14.00 on this. the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore. the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced. it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder. i think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere. its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable

men, do i love police movies filled with action, shooting, chases etcetera.boy, was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. we've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding... yet, 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some kevlar.not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. going back into the bank, where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. how stupid did the director think we'd be.okay, the shots in between that fake a documentary were good, but after seeing the film i only got the thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break. truly bad.

the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot. so the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one, but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger. i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of. they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what is wrong with these guys? they're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. okay i admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go nuts. and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? i'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. they're like ten ft. away, they hit absolutely nothing. then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. and then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something. i had a good laugh i guess.

contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because i have just seen this piece of "art", and still am under strong impressions. the reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary.well, this movie is absolutely horrible, and i would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely happens to me. the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better, as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here.so what is wrong with the movie? it has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". one first thinks about "15 minutes", which is by the way a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and indeed the two can be compared to some extent. but, as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst characteristics. they both feature mr. oleg taktarov, who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices. his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind. ah, do we miss the good old times. now, i don't imply that he is a bad actor, i am yet to judge his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. how anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. we can recognize modern american xenophobia here. the point in the movie when taktarov explains to his companion that romanians are not germans, and that they are in america is truly laughable. are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become "true" americans? then, there is the media issue. yes, it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed 44 minutes. instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show, trying to reinvent the wheel. in 15 minutes the issue of media is the central one.the point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are focusing on 44 minutes now. so, i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie. what is it? to provide good time for the audience? to glorify weapons? to glorify police? portray violence? oh yes, the officer gives the bible to the underage delinquent. so it must promote peace and understanding after all? i don't think so, but don't ask me. i only know i didn't enjoy any of this.ah, michael madsen. i admit, i am a big fan. i hoped he would be a bright point, but i was wrong. it's not his fault though. as the final note, comparing "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard.to summarize, on the scale 1-10, i give it a pure, unadulterated 1.

i was going to say this was the worst gay-themed film i've ever seen, but i can honestly say this is the worst film if any genre i've ever seen.you know you're in trouble when a movie starts with a "personal note" from the director, asking for the audience's "understanding" for the "many challenges" facing a first-time director. the audio track is so bad in many scenes it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a dvd version. bad lighting, bad sets, bad photography, poor script, generally bad acting all add up to make this "film" unwatchable. i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempts, and immediately gave away the dvd i foolishly purchased. i'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time director. but, don't try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product. i see from imdb details that this was not only the first directing attempt of richard natale, but also the only. that's the one positive thing i can say about this alleged "movie".

i awake suddenly, aware that i'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm saturday afternoon. why was i sleeping? did i hit my head? or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? could it be adult onset narcolepsy? no, i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked out.it's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through. perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary.you've been warned.

incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ("the horses, oh my god, the horses!") thriller. it's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by richard lynch. the video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.

this is one of those awful, sex-driven b-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater. women run around dressed in scantily clad "bunny" outfits, an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man, who has an oddball son (jim hanks, who is of course tom's brother), whom the man wants to get "laid." hanks is actually sort of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no point. one must wonder why it was even made? nevertheless, because of hank's performance and a few entertaining moments(but no more than a few), it received a stellar "2" out of 10. i think i was being nice, though.

this video nasty was initially banned in britain, and allowed in last november without cuts.it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979, ursula buchfellner. the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. i am not sure what the purpose of that was. it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene.laura (buchfellner) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom. peter (al cliver - the beyond, zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. of course, one of the kidnappers (antonio de cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (werner pochath) whines incessantly.the ransom exchange goes to hell, and laura runs into the jungle. will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? oh, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. why do you think it was a video nasty! muriel montossé is found by peter and his partner (antonio mayans - angel of death) on the kidnapper's boat. montossé is very comfortably undressed. peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura, who has been captured by now. they pass the time having sex, and don't see the danger approaching. guts, anyone? great fight between peter and the naked devil (burt altman).blood, decapitation, guts, lots of full frontal, some great writhing by the cannibal priestess (aline mess), and the line, "they tore her heart out," which is hilarious if you see the film.

buford's beach bunnies gives b-grade t&a films a bad name. as a fan of the genre, i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents. i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think?

i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2:00 a.m. so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon h.b.o. where this "classic" was playing. initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning, but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie. the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females, four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his uncle's diner, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner. there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth watching. basically, if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better. however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound, but even that can get annoying

bamboo house of dolls (1973, 1974 or 1977, various years are given for this title) is a hong kong veteran chin hung kuei's (killer snakes, boxer's omen, payment in blood etc.) women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers. yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films!the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad japanese (what else?) during the world war ii. the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan (shaw veteran lo lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is.there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls. the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes (for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. of course it is stupid to talk about "moral" when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements i won't accept to be found from any film.the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! for example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! also those numerous "skin fight scenes" make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. i have seen the same director's killer snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. also, it is a must for those who fear snakes.bamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship, too, which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter. the uncut version, (dubbed into a non-english language) released in europe at least in france, italy and switzerland, runs 104 pal minutes while the cut, english dubbed print released in holland, belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal. from what i've heard, the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and "plot development" and the like.bamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldn't have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general. some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous, calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation. 2/10

previous comment made me write this. it says that muslims are blonde and serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). this comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.look,race is nothing.i'm color blind.i look like pierce brosnan but i'm no irish. so what?i might add that i am not 100% serb,that i have some austrian and croat blood within me but whats the point.i'm dark, half-breed?is that so? anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.karadzhic, izetbegovich, milosevic, tudjman they are all monsters and i blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, yuggoslavia. hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. i am proud of being serb and i am proud of my cousins, austrians,croats,muslims, hungarians, arabs (yes i am from serbia and i have multiethnical family).this movie doesn't show sufferings of serbs or croats within sarayevo,terrible terrorism of street gangs,muslim extremism.i add: i kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers muslim,catholic or orthodox, killed in this war.this film is manipulation with our misery,false humanitarianism's which doesn't help at all.it helps lantos to fill his pockets with more doe,alright!

this is an anti-serb propaganda film made for tv."the muslims are good; the orthodox christian serbs are bad." that's the message.using "entertainment" to get across a propaganda message is nothing new.this movie lays it on thick.and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up.i know better.the serbs, under general draza milhalovitch and his chetniks, saved over 500 shot-down us fliers from the germans in world war ii.churchill decided to betray milhalovitch and put british backing behind communist tito. roosevelt followed suit and as a result, after the war ended yugoslavia was delivered over to communist tito.and us ally milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since.this movie is part of the anti-serb propaganda campaign engineered by george soros and his international crisis group (icg) which culminated in the kosovo "war," in which serbia was bombed by nato because of totally false claims by the icg of "mass graves" in kosovo filled with "victims" of the nasty serbs. the fact that there were no such mass graves and the albanians (muslims) had no business being in serbia's kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print.i chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting.imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at serbia.instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the clinton administration to come clean with the congress and with the american people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in sarajevo.i won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie.

i saw this film a while ago on a video cd.i will 1st mention the good points.the movie, at first, at least tries to appear that it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. both main characters are friends and co-exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, sport rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.but, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict. sure, the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.the history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic, who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliament's 2nd largest party(sdp). according to the constitution of bosnia, the sdp was to have the presidency in 1992, but there was a coup in january. the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secession.the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from "stth". he was a student of nazism in ww2. he even wrote his own "mein kampf" in which he stated: "it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between 'the islamic religion' and non-islamic social and political institutions".in 1990 he lost the idap elections to "pro-yugoslavia moderate" fikret abdic, a bosnian muslim, that worked with christian serbs during the civil war, and who treated his supporters like brothers. abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic, who lost the elections but seized the seat of power.the events from above are missing from the movie, but they are the factual events that lead to the war.there were problems with props too. serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww2 helmets, which they did not use. also the one soldier was holding an m-1944 ww2 rifle only used by ussr not yugoslavia.the director and script writers had a chance, but they chose to re-write history.

there is one good thing in this movie: lola glaudini's ass! sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth. too bad she didn't do a nude. it would at least have made this mess tolerable. we see another chick's boobs but she's nowhere near lola. and man, is armand assante old or what? the man looks like crap! "consequence" is the usual b-movie you would expect. the story had potential. it's like they had good ideas but didn't know how to execute them. the cinematography is just plain awful. ugly! the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors. lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap, slutty way but not even she saves "consequence" from being trash and not funny trash, just plain old stinking trash.

seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable. it prompted me to exclaim "oh my god!" more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly.fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, near impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist.if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one. otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time!(that a film released in 2003 is already being shown on tv in july 2003 might give an indication of the film's quality)

i found the dvd version of this movie at a rummage sale. the basic premise is an affair between a teacher/coach a student. the acting is weak and the plot razor thin.this movie had all the depth and plot development of an adult film.

a high school principal (keenan wynn) with a losing basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out not only to be a gorgeous blond woman (cathy lee crosby) but a catalyst for their new winning ways. are you really surprised? along the way a romance grows between the coach and the team's star player jack (michael biehn). the police are never notified.packaged along with other crown international pictures as a grindhouse movie really does this film no service. this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week. cathy lee crosby looks great as coach randy rawlings especially in her skimpy outfits but i expected more than mere titillation from an r-rated film. a side plot involving a dorky center who is hypnotized by his teammates into thinking he is former nba player sydney wicks is the actual reason for the team's new success rather than cathy lee's coaching. too much tease and not enough sleaze makes this a major disappointment.

this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team. similar to goldie hawn's wildcats, it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role, and she does as about as well as the script allows. i think racquel welch would have been a better choice, but considering the film's apparent tv movie budget, they probably couldn't afford her. cathy lee does look great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely nude. the story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role. he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee. keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports. this point is brought up throughout the film, and, needless to say, is dated. ironically, cathy lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do. there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney wicks. it looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby. she's not that great an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair, and a very tan body.

i watched this movie when i was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seen-or ever was to see. it may not have been a great movie. my guess is it wasn't. i don't really remember much about it, to tell you the truth. i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn. no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie. i haven't seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i don't think i'd want to see it again since i'm sure it would be a disappointment-my hormones aren't as raging and i've become more jaded over the years. still, when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back when.added later: after watching the movie again, i discovered that it's dangerous to go home again. what was once erotic is now pretty tame. the older woman-younger man thing still works for me, just not as much as it once did, probably because i'm no longer a 12-year-old. that older woman is now younger than i am. also, the amateurishness of the whole thing wasn't perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. moral: sometimes it's better not to revisit the past.

this one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era. of course, that doesn't mean coach (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. it runs into the same vein as fastbreak (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. what i mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. it's the same feeling you may get after watching this. a nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty, but i expected better things.

like last year, i didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. okay, so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the top 10 most boring. a lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted top 10. i hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although i knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (natalie portmanif there's no director, she's gone). the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious, beyonce knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. adam sandler wins the worst presenter award.for helping me write this review i'd like to thank my mum, my dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and i'd like to point out that i have a high metabolism and of course i haven't been starving myself for a month. i'm not going to cry...thank you.

i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: 1 ) host steve martin was at his most wittiest: " i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo " and " i'll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle's head in my bed " 2 ) surprise winners: no one had adrien brody down for best actor ( genuine applause ) or roman polanski for best director ( genuine jeers and boos ) but they won last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( fellowship was much better )but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne ! oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics ( obviously they are ) i'm sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers chris rock wasn't too bad , but he's no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the " minor " oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! there's no such thing as a " minor " oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they're as well deserved as best picture or best director . all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . as for the awards themselves best supporting actress - cate blanchett . no great surprise for a competitive category best supporting actor - morgan freeman . no real complaints since freeman is one of america's greatest living character actors best actor - jamie foxx . most predictable award of the night . yawn best actress - hilary swank . major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night best director - clint eastwood . major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one . actually i'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for taxi driver , raging bull or goodfellas he didn't deserve it for the aviator best film - million dollar baby . again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd's sake ! and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts

seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners.although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring. i think it's seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something really new. it's pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more 'hip' and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p. diddy and prince present a category. also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. none of it really worked out.sure, chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn't really a good presenter. i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories. his presence wasn't really as 'big' as for instance billy crystal's.also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times. not letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird.still, i can't remember being any more satisfied with the award winners. none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case. so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants? i don't think so. i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now, with the exception of "million dollar baby" and "the passion of the christ" maybe. sure i don't agree with every single award that was handed out this year, for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography, not that i don't like robert richardson's work, he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone's work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more. also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music. but oh well, there is no way the academy awards can please everybody of course, i understand that. there will always be people complaining about the winners.it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners. did prince said any of the nominees names right at once? and were is sean penn's sense of humor? al pacino and jeremy "i hope they missed" irons were the best presenters of the night.overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners.4/10

i'm not usually given to hyperbole, but after seeing over two decades worth of academy awards, i can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most disgraceful example of poor direction, total cruelty, and sheer stupidity that i've ever had the misfortune to witness. i'm not talking about the awards themselves- as usual, there is plenty to argue about when you tally up who won, who lost, and who never even got nominated, but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's liable to be. what is terribly unfair is the treatment both the "stars" and "non-stars" received at the hands of cates and horvitz, in the name of "reducing boredom."it is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn't al pacino has been "played off" at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying, how he was saying it, and what the emotion was behind the statement. it demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect, however, to herd nominees on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read, to make them slink away quietly when they lose, to deny them the thrill of a walk to the podium, and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience. all of those things were done to the "non-stars" -never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience. the stars didn't fare much better. it's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of hilary swank and clint eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches. chris rock, as host, was neither as inflammatory and controversial as the academy had hoped, nor nearly as funny as he could be. his opening remarks were almost (but not quite) as offensive as sean penn made them out to be, and his comments during the show were more innocuous than interesting. of course, he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a leash as any host has. in the end, chris rock was something he's almost never been before: a non-entity.even the musical numbers were handled poorly. beyonce sang well, but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs. another example of utter disrespect for an artist was giving jorge drexler's nominated song to antonio banderas- even though drexler was present and clearly wouldn't have minded singing his own song, based on his winning "speech." the efforts of cates and horvitz to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree, but what resulted was a show devoid of life. we've all whined about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know, about the overblown production, about the self-congratulatory quality. but this is their night- not ours. what is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated. cates and horvitz should, frankly, be ashamed.

my spouse & i found this movie to be very schlocky. it started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, abbie, who really was terrific. in addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially gideon, the angel's. also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. at first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. we love almost all of the hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. there are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.

i thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies i have ever seen--the others being the christmas wife and jack frost. all three movies are about death. if you like being thoroughly depressed, then by all means watch this film or any of the others. in this film, the acting is good and some of the scenery (apart when people are dying) is lovely. but, i am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in! despite a "happily ever after" ending, the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another. and, for some crazy reason, i don't want to be depressed when i watch a christmas movie (i know this sounds crazy folks--after all, isn't bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway?).for a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten house without a christmas tree, george c. scott's christmas carol or a christmas story instead--unless of course you like being miserable.

sorry, but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face. the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas,...and santa does. dad is peachy, happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died. all ends syrupy sweet.but as a parent who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend, it was a horror flick. now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa! do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart- no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas. it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh.shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently. it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child, but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility.

first of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays. this movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. mary steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their house, can't buy christmas presents for the kids, etc. you get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. so along comes harry dean stanton as gideon the christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. what better way to instill the spirit of christmas in mary steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in christmas again. santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam. the movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. i'm sure this film wanted to be something capra-like, but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be.

this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw. i took my two small children to see this. it was the darkest, most dismal plot- family has no money, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. mom is left all alone. no wonder her christmas spririt is gone. christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned, and santa does not bring back dead fathers! i thought this was the worst message to send children. better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this!!

read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (was that all!).unremittingly bleak, this film sets out to produce (i'm guessing) a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style. if fails....completely and absolutely fails. i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't. let me mention some of the highlights ...people don't die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa's factory. angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees. santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). and the plot.. i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any. even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere looking cold, damp and miserable. as you might guess, the film has a happy (schmaltzy) ending. what a relief !

european vacation (aka national lampoon's european vacation) is the weakest of the vacation films (the first and third one the most superior of the films). while chevy chase and beverly d'angelo return as clark and ellen griswold (with new actors in the roles of russ and audrey griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. this causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. to be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the "jokes" as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbled-together script), rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 vacation films have. oh well, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10.

the goofy griswalds win the t.v. game show "pig in a poke" grand prize, and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another. of all the ridiculous, unfunny money-spinning sequels this one beats the lot. harold ramis' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish "vacation" across the states. this time amy heckerling ("look who's talking") helms what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh.hughes script (with rob klane) is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead-beat project, as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer. even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining.yet, as inconceivable as it may seem, "european vacation" was successful enough to warrant a second sequel! surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one. you know, i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother.monday, december 26, 1994 - t.v.

the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one, as clark griswold wins a trip for the whole family to europe.the tasteless, below the belt humor that worked so well the first time around is practically nonexistent here. that fault surely lies with director hackerling, who's obviously nowhere near as good a director as harold ramis and a very uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around.the cast does what they can; chevy chase injects some form of life into the proceedings but it's simply not enough and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman. some potentially hilarious moments aren't played out to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. all depictions of europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like how the english are sooo polite).apart from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick. but if you're a chevy chase fan (like myself) the film is watchable, but no more than that.

john hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the '80s. "european vacation" is not one of them. the follow-up to hughes' first big hit "vacation" (1983), is about as predictable, unfunny and annoying as they come -- no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic clark and ellen griswold (chase and d'angelo).i greatly enjoyed "vacation" as well as the third film, 1989's "christmas vacation," but the griswold's trip to europe is bland and forced. perhaps because this was hughes' first attempt at a sequel that he didn't get it, but it's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story "european vacation" is. there is no through story: the griswolds win a game show for being "greedy little pigs" and go on a tour of europe through england, france, germany and italy. even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming, which is part director amy heckerling's fault. the "fast times at ridgemont high" director sets everything up too predictably.maybe it was hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel. "european vacation" takes great pride in insulting americans (recall the greedy little pig game show they win), especially tourists, represented by the cornball griswold family. it also pats itself on the back implicitly saying "oh us griswolds, we're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot." then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to america and how grateful the griswolds are to return to such a better country. if hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie, well maybe i should award this 8/10 stars.it's not just the unfunniness, but "european vacation" boasts the two worst actors to play kids rusty and audrey (jason lively and dana hill). they're both annoying and obnoxious, with the unattractive and loud-mouthed audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she's left behind nearly the entire film. hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst. quite tasteful. speaking of, breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason (unless it was to comment on americans' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies).i will give the film one of its two stars thanks to eric idle of the monty python crew, whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from "holy grail" is about the funniest part. if hughes intended for us to find one of the film's only non- american actors as the only funny part, then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of hollywood comedy in the '80s. still, would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining?

some amusing humor, some that falls flat, some decent acting, some that is quite atrocious. this movie is simply hit and miss, guaranteed to amuse 12 year old boys more than any other niche.the child actors in the movie are just unfunny. when you are making a family comedy, that does tend to be a problem. beverly d'angelo rises above the material to give a funny, and dare i say it, human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.

any movie with "national lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london,england,paris,france,rome,italy,and anywhere in germany.it may be an institution in the u.s. but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience."national lampoon's european vacation" is unlikely to rectify that situation. the appalling griswalds are just that - appalling.they are not funny. clearly mr chevy chase thinks he's funny, after all miss b.di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes,but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out £2.50 for the privilege. the section set in england is typical.the same old same old tv performers, messrs idle,smith,coltrane,miss m.lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés,mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor....yawn,yawn,yawn.. bucking - ham palace,big ben......i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two.........rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren,need i go on? the english are buffoons,the french vicious - tongued yank-haters.the germans pompous and puffed up,(don't mention the war,clark),and the italians lecherous bottom-pinchers.have i forgotten anything? every possible "comic" situation is worked to death,mr chase gurns desperately,miss di angelo dimples sweetly,the children are embarrassingly bad. the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.

i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie! the lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding! however, this european vacation sequel is a major let down.in this sequel, the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show. the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, "ha-ha" laughs. for example, a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark, "do you want your coke in the can?" clark answers back, "no, i'll have it right here." that's really about the only line that is funny in this film.european vacation's humor is strained. as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to re-hash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.worse, the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. their replacements are not funny, can't act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time. there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste.the griswald's should have stayed in wally world. the place that made them legends! don't join them on this european dreadful adventure. viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this! you'll be glad you did.

last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito's way - "carlito's way: rise to power (2005)" which went straight to dvd...no wonder .....it completely ...and i mean completely s%&ks !!! waist of time watching it and i think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... i don't understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that i tip my hat to... jay hernandez who plays the young brigante.... reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don corleone in godfather ii ...but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it !!! jay hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino.... too bad for him i don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh#$%ty movie, i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.

soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! this movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. instead this is a common theme in hollywood, rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc.this film's plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent. i seriously felt like i was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. p diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time.the only good thing that comes out of this movie is jaclyn desantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film.if you are a big carlito's way fan, i recommend you not watch this. if you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original, because that is exactly what it did.

not sure if i'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director..."devil hunter" sure is one bizarre 'horror' movie.the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like "cannibal ferox" and "cut and run." chick gets kidnapped in the 'jungle' by a 'tribe' of 'savages.' the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico. the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city-style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb. and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic. i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.to make matters worse, this film has ultra-minimal gore, no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis. not fun. i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro-trash film; this one just fell way short.2 out of 10, kids.

i rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. what i got was a piece of pure garbage. this movie was confusing in most spots, choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots. mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley; at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie.the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably. almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen. jay rodan was almost good as agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. in the end, i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds. i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. if they've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. if i had been there, they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring. thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes. guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end!

gods, i haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. maybe not since 'the new guy' or various freddie prinze jr. movies. yes, it is that astoundingly awful. mira sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by freddie. the movie staging was awkward (like a play, rather, and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film). the actors had no idea what they were doing, especially sorvino. her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? nonsensical! i had to turn the dvd player off, it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film.

i gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful). the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is ben kingsley, who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way.mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece.stupid, stupid story and horrible production. do not waste your video rental $.

"the triumph of love" doesn't triumph over anything. it is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. it pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as ben kingsley and fiona shaw. the supporting players are not quite as awful. maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be clownish, but, if so, i didn't see it that way. mira sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other. she(he)'s just there. my guess is, the play of the same name, written by marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is much better. it couldn't be any worse. clare peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. i don't know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. maybe it all got lost in the translation.

i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful. how wrong am i!it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it. mira sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. she is a pretty girl, but in this movie, she is not seductive at all, but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. it is so ridiculous.and the dialog of the film is so pretentious, and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable.totally failure.

as the number of video nasties i've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my "to rent" list when i saw it was available.the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. he's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors ever! granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. after stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and i found myself muting much of those scenes.oh, did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity? this is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. also, jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. so, if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you got it.i can't recommend this trash to anyone. it's not even the good bad movie. it's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. if you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.

the trouble with the book, "memoirs of a geisha" is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man's way of thinking. reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, sets, and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters.the movie isn't about japan or real geisha. it is a story about a few american men's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. so what is this movie if it isn't about japan or geisha? is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? yes, but then why make it into an american fantasy?there were so many missed opportunities. imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups, no connotations of sin about sex. sex is natural and normal. how is sex handled in this movie? right. like it was dirty. the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? nope. one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha.did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off? nope. she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block. of course she isn't supposed to enjoy it. and that is what i mean about this movie. why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong?behind mameha the chairman was sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity. he could have rigged the auction and won her himself. nobu didn't even bid. so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and, reeking of old-man stink, get his fingers all over her naked body? would any woman ever really forgive a man for that?let's try to make sense of this. by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri's geisha training. in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr. crab. through mameha the chairman sold sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her. the chairman wasn't her patron. he was her pimp! some romantic love story.yes, the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret. under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male. not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie, distortion, and terribly wrong.some contrasts between japan and moag:japanese style  refined, elegant simplicity. moag style  peking opera.japanese geisha  hair swept up. moag geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup.japanese shaved ice - japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances. shaved ice is strictly a summer treat. moag shaved ice - the chairman buys chiyo, the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo, this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season. the thought made my entire body shiver with cold.japanese geisha  trained and skilled entertainers. moag geisha - sluts.japanese wind chime - used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes, thanks to the breeze, japanese people feel somehow cooler. moag wind chime - a door bell! if a person stood in front of another's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic, not gain entrance.japan  emphasis on human relationships, group oriented. moag  "i want a life that's mine" american individualism.japanese traditional dance  refined elegance. an almost geometrical and mechanical precision. moag dance  martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not-very-auspicious white japanese funeral shroud. performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? ha ha ha! is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha?japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community. fires can rip through those wooden villages, towns, and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people. moag house fire - great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out. technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again. which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled.enough. the movie stinks.

"piece is cake" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the (admittedly fictional) pilots it portrays. it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.in the march 1989 "aeroplane monthly", roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini-series. a few of his comments are worth repeating:"there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that i saw in action, and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in 'piece of cake'. it would not have been tolerated for a moment... ...the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club, though with more discipline. nor was there any sense of 'death or glory'. raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we were required to do it - no more and no less."there was no discussion of 'bravery' or 'cowardice'. people either had guts or they did not - but mostly they did. but we knew fear, recognised it in ourselves and in each other, did our damnedness to control it, and then got on with the job..."...i could feel no 'glory', but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to 'piece of cake'."beamont was, in his own words, "a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series, was there at the time".beamont served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob, before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest, and a post-war test pilot."piece of cake" is an absolute, total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time. it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace...

slow, incomprehensible, boring. three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book. this is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book. the best part of the movie was the scenery, excellent. the worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances. the editing is abrupt and patchy. however, despite this, the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script. it was startling that although set in peru there was hardly a person of peruvian descent wandering about the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting peru in the 17th century. if you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.

this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons. basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600's) obviously reincarnated. god is an impersonal force. animal life and plant life are all the same. (this is pantheism). redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty. his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality. as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for $10.00 will show you how to start your own religion. as one famous prophet has said, "use the force luke".

i actually didn't enjoy this movie.i saw it at a camp, and we didn't rave about it, we laughed at it. sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, i know it was based on a book which i haven't read, but i hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, i thought that this movie was very bad and boring). like i said, i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus i got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, i struggled to stay awake. the only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. i just really didn't like it.

i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time. the movie was boring, long long and awful plot. the special effects sucks like hell - it's like watching a movie back in 1999. it's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. matthew settle's performance was quite bad. i saw him in band of brothers playing lt.speirs, he wasn't that bad. in fact not bad at all. but in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either. plus, his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it. it surprised me, really, because he was good in band of brothers.anyway, don't even bother to watch this movie. it's a big big big waste of time. even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watching this movie. trust me, you'll regret it!

at first, three words: read the book! really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. it was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. the novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! that's only the surroundings. in the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! they screwed it up! ... i'll never watch it again!

if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country, "the celestine prophecy" is a good example: 1. perú, not even in its most violent times, has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film. this showed a country like el salvador when civil war. since i'm a peruvian who lives in lima (the capital of perú), it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here, there and everywhere. 2. if you have a car in perú, and you want (or need) to be a taxi driver, just post a sticker with the word "taxi" on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets (there are taxi companies, but their rates are quite expensive). no need of yellow or a black/white squared band on the doors of your car. well, taxis in this film have that band, somethin that you will never see in perú. 3. peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing. for example, when a taxi driver comes out, he was wearing a "guayabera" (cuban shirt), a white hat, and 40's mustaches, like clark gable. not one peruvian man looks like that, please! perú is not the caribbeans! 4. a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt, like the typical folklore dresses in latin america. take a walk anywhere in perú, and you'll never find a woman wearing like that, unless you are watching a typical dance. 5. cast could've been better: i can not deny héctor elizondo is a great actor, but he's not a latin actor (his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico, but he was born in new york) and his spanish is not fluent. it's notorious spanish is not his first language. there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as cardinal sebastián. petrus antonius (general rodríguez) was also a bad choice for a "latin police officer". it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodríguez's office. they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class, making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish. unsuccessfully, of course. castulo guerra was better in his spanish. a "peruvian" officer, who announced cardinal sebastián, spoke a quite funny spanish too. there are very good peruvian actors, like augusto alvarez-calderón and christian meier (just to mention two out of many peruvian actors), who could've performed with excellence. 6. i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or, even, countries. but, please, when creating a name, be careful when using a foreign language: the town portrayed in this movie should've been called "vicente" and not "viciente". vicente is a male name, and viciente has never been used. 7. i disagree one user, who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perú. not one location is peruvian, although the production has used in excess posters showing "inca kola", the peruvian soda. as not few american films, this one must have used any latin country. after all, for american producers or directors, a latin place is identical to any other latin place. 8. in the first scenes, when john (matthew settle) flies to perú, he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perú: jorge chávez airport (in lima, the capital). actually, believe me, it must be any airport in the world, but peruvian airport. and, of course, in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards. 9. when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel, this one has a fan and, obviously has no air conditioner. please, this doesn't happen in no hotel in perú(and other latin countries), unless you get a 1 star hotel! 10. the rebels who fight against the government are... ¡colombians! their accent was, with no doubt, from colombia. for casting them, the producers should've hired peruvian actors. in few words, it would've been cheaper filming in perú.i could go on with more examples out of this film, that led me to give it a "1" (awful) vote, but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning. but dear producers: it's not a tragedy: there are many worse movies with not few mistakes. just let's remember "indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull" and indescribable disney's "the emperor's new groove". the list of bad films could be endless...

i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of "spiritual" new age types, who, quite unlike me, very much enjoyed this movie---although according to those that also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the movie is not quite as good. so, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like "aura" and "astral body", and don't mind the frequent use of the term "energy" outside of the context of physics or technology, you might actually like the movie, and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on.however, if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based thereon, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to denote the happening of spirituality, and perhaps even expect reasonable non-wooden dialog an acting, then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie: stay. away.don't even think about it. tonight, this movie displaced dungeons and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater (i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad, such as plan 9 etc.). at the same time, it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two (d&d being the other one). i do not walk out on movies, not even on this one, but i should've when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura, because the new age bs keeps on getting thicker and thicker from that point on.the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old prophecies, in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution. or something like that. they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution, which should make anybody who has even the faintest idea of what human evolution is cringe. the movie is shock full with whoppers like that. occasionally people beam to what they would certainly describe as "another dimension", or perhaps "another plane", only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment. goodness.at the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the "insights" making up the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened individuals.good things about the movie? some very pretty nature shots, and some decent supporting performances by elizondo and de almeida.i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. it really is el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind, and unless that's your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.

i read the book and the book was fascinating.this movie, it's direction, the screenplay, and the acting were totally insufferable. i cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the action, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story.i can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities. would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know. simply, one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth.the cinematography was indeed the only highlight. but, how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as peru. to prospective viewers, do not waste your time or energy on this flop.

this movie is just not worth your time. its reliance upon new-age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. the plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.i was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel. their motivation & objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of new age consciousness.so would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians, or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies/television that support their views? in spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? i hope not.i am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.

this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film-making may not "open" you up, to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching. based on the best-selling book by james redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher (matthew settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. although there's a lot of talk about "energy," that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include thomas kretschmann, annabeth gish, hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. for those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the roman catholic church; armand mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr. redfield, barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script. in short, easily the worst film seen in 40+ years of viewing movies.

i have just seen this movie and have not read the book. the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject, evolution, sincronicity and your part in the world.however, the movie's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters. it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version. the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable. a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose. enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to. do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves (in little buddha) ? well, this is nothing like that.most scenes are poorly executed. there are a lot of scenes that really don't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere.the better actors in this movie, namely hector elizondo, joaquim de almeida and jürgen prochnow cannot save it. the first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie, and because they were paid more, but this does not work. most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all.jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy (as always), but the script does not help him at all. the scene where he first tries to convince john (matthew settle) to join him is just bad script. the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed. the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented.overall this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! i have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than this, it has to be.it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb.

sure, i like short cartoons, but i didn't like this one. naturally, kids would love it. but then again, i'm not a kid anymore (although i still consider myself young).i will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar?! well... i guess it's because people in the 30's were more happy with not much than now. in the present where we live, everything must happen fast. look at the movies nowadays, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow. that's really a shame. i wish i lived in the 30's, because it seems so peaceful. but every time has got its ups and downs, i guess...to conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. otherwise, don't spill your time on it.

what is this crap? my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title... i decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored, and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality.first, the acting was terrible. they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards. the delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. scene cuts were terrible.. it looks like they took it straight from the story board, if there was one.secondly, the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all- again, very formulaic. i can't count the times i was able to predict the next joke. i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly "subtle" sexual innuendos. the cat, the beaver patch, hung wong?.. c'mon! just.. stay away from this movie. it's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. it's just stupid-stupid. it's like a pg kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity, and violence to bump the mpaa rating. stay away."would you like to ride my yacht?""is that what they're calling it now?""you could ride my ding.""oh! i think i got blood on my stool!"badly played, sir.

if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $9 on a used textbook, not this movie. i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana. i don't think the directors really got any point across, but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several: 1) science can explain everything we do, meaning that our lives are deterministic; 2) science can't be used to explain everything we do, meaning that we have free will; 3) science is, like, really cool, brother; 4) we are god; 5) the world exists only in our minds; 6) sarah norman is a tough role to follow and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff.

if you want to see intelligent, philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential, watch "waking life," which is brilliant. "what the #$*! do we know" is all over the place in its focus, poorly directed, poorly written, poorly acted, utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying. it wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest. the inclusion of that rambling freak "ramtha" in this film is reason enough to avoid it. isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old atlantian god or something? what a flake that old chick is, and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.

a definite no. a resounding no. this movie is an absolute dud.having been recommended to me by a friend very much into "that sort of thing," i watched this movie with some anticipation of being informed, changed, moved, altered, uplifted, and all the other positive mystical things that could happen to me when i suddenly see the truth. now this may sound like someone who is already predisposed to poo-pooing anything dealing with the metaphysical, the metaphysical/physical boundaries of existence. believe me, i am not such a person. i try to be open about any presentation and then decide accordingly.in terms of content, the only thing i found mildly interesting and informative, was the bit about peptides, emotions, addiction, and cellular receptors. that was the only "unifying" element i could find in the documentary part of this film. the rest of the documentary rambled around several topics and never seemed to unify and cohere, try to tie up and conclude to a point. and what was all that stuff about native americans not being able to see the ships that columbus came in? who told the "authorities" in this film that that was what happened in 1492? where they there too? had they compared this to scientific work being done in visual cognition (the famous gorilla video, for example, visit the visual cognition lab at the university of illinois site) there may have been a more convincing point made. here, however, it seemed like unsupported mystical mumbo-jumbo.as a film: this wasn't one film, it was two. i found the documentary part mildly interesting, just to hear the people talking about what they were talking about (i was annoyed that their credentials weren't presented at the bottom of the screen when they spoke, at least initially!) but i found the "story" part of the movie with matlin in it annoying, disjointed, intrusive, non-related and downright stupid. that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny. it was laughable, ludicrous, sophomoric, and stupid. and i found the use of the word "pollack" offensive. it just seemed so out of place and wrong. is such usage okay because a member of the group uses a pejorative term to refer to the group because he or she is a member of the group? that may be okay to make a point, but it didn't seem to be used that way here. and in any case, i don't care what the reason, it offended me, a pole. i never call myself or refer to my ethnic background as "pollack." and i certainly don't like like it when others do. can i watch or listen to a bigoted conversation in which this term is used? you betcha! but again this didn't seem to be the case here. it just seemed so out of place. unprovocked, unmitigated.the acting was abysmal. elaine hendrix's performance was totally unbelievable. at times, it seemed like she was just reading her lines that had just been given to her. marlee matlin for the most part seemed to be sleep walking through this whole thing. perhaps she was baffled by the material. i know i was. if she was supposed to be portraying a disillusioned drugged-up anxiety-prone malcontent, it just didn't seem to click. but by far, the world's worst was hendrix! all in all, i found this a disjointed, poorly acted piece of clap-trap.

i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent "short history of nearly everything" and what i was able to choke down in "a brief history of time," it sounded interesting at times. however, the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channelling" some loony named "ramtha" completely upset the applecart for me.what a waste of two hours.

if you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory, read "the elegant universe" by brian greene of columbia university, and "the universe in a nutshell" by stephen hawking of cambridge.recipe for #$*!:3 parts bombastic new age pontificator, 2 parts pseudoscientist, 2 parts real scientistmix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance.serving suggestion: barf bags.

well, what can i say."what the bleep do we know" has achieved the nearly impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as "the postman", "the dungeon master", "merlin", and so fourth, it will go down in history as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety. and that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive indeed, for i have seen many a bad movie.this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a bunch of talking heads going on about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their new-agy pseudo-philosophy. basically, if you start your day off meditating to the likes of enya and kenny g, this movie is for you. if you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun, and a sizable portion of good weed, then this movie is for you as well. otherwise, stay away. take my word for it.the first thing that struck me about "what the bleep do you know" is that is seemed to be edited and put together by the same kinds of people that shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated sparkles across the screen, and other assorted silliness. who let these people anywhere near a theatrical release is a mystery to me. i guess this is what too much kenny g does to you. the movie was permeated with cheesy gci, the likes that you or i can produce on our own computer via over-the-counter video editing software, but never would, because it's just way too ridiculous.the script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever. not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and contrived beyond belief, but the "writers" felt like they had to shove every relevant piece of information, or rather disinformation, which is what most of this movie was all about, all the way down your throat. well, given the target audience, that may not have been too bad of an idea. the main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills. apparently, though, it was deemed not convincing enough, so there are at least a couple of dialogs in throughout, which refer to her anti-anxiety pills specifically, just in case the viewers should not be able to connect her overacted pain and suffering with little white pills she takes whenever she feels down. the acting... well, i've seen better acting in ed wood movies, and no, this is not an exaggeration. heck, the little play i was in when i was 12 featured much more inspiring acting than this. it really did.the story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors, and self-proclaimed mystics, go on and on about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" for how ever man or woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. reality, you see, is a probability-field of a bunch of different possibilities, and is only set in stone once you the observer chose to notice it. what happens when more than one observer observes they didn't say, but then again who cares. listen to enya, meditate, observe, and you shall be god, and nobody gives a damn about such silly and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. all reason is immediately dismissed as people being stuck in their ways and unable to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". furthermore, the heidelberg uncertainty principle supposedly is proof positive of alternate realities, parallel universes, and such.speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie. all of these people keep talking about going down rabbit holes. i'm not sure what that had to do with anything else they were saying or showing, but one thing i'm certain of is that it somehow involves anal sex. actually, the movie is _extremely_ anti-sex. throughout, sex is presented as dirty, ugly, and anti-enlightening.in any case, the talking heads talk, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over her body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk around with an even stupider look in her glazed over eyes than she started with.i want 2 hours of my life back.here's a couple of random quotes which i happened to remember:"what i think of as unreal has become a lot more real to me, and that, which i used to consider real, is oftentimes a lot less real than the unreal." - some talking head on the spirituality of quantum physics."what does it take for one man to have an erection? it takes just one thought. nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are within. an yet he has an erection" - some self proclaimed mystic, head of her own school of enlightenment.[while looking at herself in the mirror] "i hate you! i hate you! you're fat! you're ugly! i have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.

i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom. we (my g-friend and i) walked out about an hour into it. what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon.sub atomic particles are thoughts? by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals? a drop of 25% in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated. wow, what a rigorous scientific study. i'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time. should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate? hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! btw- it was funded by the ramtha cult, the leader of which was one of the "experts" which were interview by the filmmakers. no ulterior motives here, right?

remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on 60 minutes a few years ago? this is her. lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers. the producers have been using phony "word of mouth" promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe. if you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age dreck and day-old baloney, this film is for you. if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn't a wacko, so you'll give her a bunch of your money. if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent. <http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman>

i was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake.i can't write a single good thing about it. first, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs. in my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic.low budget 'effects' (if i can even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money.acting... i feel sorry for the actors. are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this? (looking at their recent filmography, it would appear so.) despite the outfits, pamela is showing her age and as a whole, they don't even come across as sexy, let alone funny.this movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category. it's just bad, as if everybody involved was sick of it.avoid.

anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after 40 min., as my wife and i did. the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand-waiving arguments and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even an attempt at a logical reason) from real science. i'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of "science". i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book, didn't understand a word of it, then watched the matrix about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie.for example, the washington dc crime experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program. a brief search will reveal the science of their methods.

it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was. consequently, they had even more trouble delivering it. they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub-atomic particles. having established a fuzzy picture of heisenberg's uncertainty principle, they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale. then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers: positive thinking, interrupting bad patterns, always look on the bright side, etc. next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins: hormones which we more or less choose to create. if you are sad, you will create sad proteins. if you are happy, you will create happy proteins. it's just so simple, isn't it? interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda, a photographer who pops anti-depressants and hates her thighs. the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say, "hey, amanda, just cheer up!" why can't she cheer up? obviously it's because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion, that's why. the conclusion of the film (which is basically the entire second half) brought on a barrage of contradiction. we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings, but a collective consciousness, but we are individuals who can change the world, but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions, but we can choose who we are, and we have a purpose to do good, but there is no god because there is nothing better than us, so there is no such thing as right and wrong, so there is no such thing as reward or punishment, so nothing good ever came out of religion, but we should still do good anyway, even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is, except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate, and then crime will cease, and if we say nice things, our water will freeze into pretty shapes. still with me? good because there is more. according to robert l. park in his book "voodoo science", the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington, d.c. was a farce, the numbers were doctored, and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since. and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy? this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight.so does all this work or not? i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse, one of the film's three directors (yes, three) fielded questions following the show. i call myself lucky because i had first-hand confirmation that these people don't know what they are talking about. several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband, a chiropractor, had to step in and recite the answer. i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political, and everyone, including ms. chasse, began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie.

this movie made me very angry. i wanted desperately to throttle the "scientists" and unseen film-makers during the course of it. very, very painful to sit through. sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. the little good information on brain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t. the worst offenders were the crack-pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza. mr. dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them. i think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum. much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. fittingly, the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and cliché ridden.i would refer people instead to bill bryson's excellent survey of science: "a brief history of nearly everything." there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual, established science.

as a physics student, i've become aware of many idiot professors, and other so-called experts, in the field. as i continue with my studies, i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on, and about the people who are doing things right.then, my friends tell me of this "physics movie" they want to see. knowing nothing of it, i'm excited, hoping that the information will be presented well.i've done real quantum mechanics; this wasn't it.this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can, and will, occur to you, if you just open your eyes. let's think about that, for just a moment.our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles. that is a million billion billion billion particles! the more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% probability of cancelling each other out completely. as you add more and more particles into the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it...it's just stupid.my friend, also in physics, and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie. but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen.i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie, as i have not had any kind of medical training. it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it, remembering my days in biology, but i cannot say.at least this film had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever they actually were) scene. not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all different types of personalities "driven" by their peptides*, and then the film cuts to the dance floor, where we are spliced between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by cg peptides, and a fully cg scene, filled with dancing peptides. the film, at that point, was trying to tell us how we're "addicted to emotions," so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit, "addicted to love."this scene was redeeming, because anyone who could go through that scene, and still take this movie seriously...well, you are the ones that need to "open your eyes."

i had numerous problems with this film.it contains some basic factual information concerning quantum mechanics, which is fine. although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to be saying: "aren't you just blown away by this!" well, not really. these aren't earth shattering revelations anymore. at any rate, i was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc. is not new.the main problem i have with this movie, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way of providing a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. i don't have any serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics doesn't really have anything to do with these things, and it should be kept separate. the people they interviewed for this movie start with the ideas of quantum theory and then make the leap to say that simply by thinking about something you can alter the matter around you, hence we should think positively so as to have a positive impact on the world and make our lives better. the reasoning is completely ridiculous, and the conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. for every so called "expert" that they interviewed for this film, there are scores of theoretically physicists who would completely disagree. they would point out, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not lend support to mystical notions about our spiritual connectedness.it disturbs me that people are going to see this film and completely eat it up because it leaves them with a nice positive feeling. the main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments.avoid this film.oh yeah. at one point, one of the "experts" says that since throughout history most of the assumptions people have made about the world turned out to be false, therefore the assumptions we currently hold about the world are also likely to be false. huh? that totally does not follow. and even if it did, i don't see how that helps his argument. i mean, if his ideas ever became common assumptions then i guess we would have to assume that they are false too, based on his own reasoning.

suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it - not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor. josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters. do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store.

a question for you : a family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . which film am i talking about ? every horror film you`ve seen ? yes that`s true but that`s not the answer i`m looking for . i`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . doesn`t help ? well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s pov . no futher forward ? okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? could still be any horror film you say . oh gawd this could take weeks so i`ll say the film i`m talking about features loads of aussies many of whom have appeared in neighbours and home and away . yes that`s right the film is the third circle ( aka cubbyhouse ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? it`s about me pointing out how the third circle is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made

having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob, who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both men's love of oratory. i think self-absorbed dennis quaid(an actual texan) would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here. our unofficial motto is "it ain't braggin' if it is a fact" was made for crockett. and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made. to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained mexican regulars. every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand.

the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song-and-dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an american girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles. unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend (the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings!). wafty fred astaire-ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script, which is full of juvenile behavior. astaire and rogers don't just 'meet cute'--they meet ridiculously (he's tap-dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). audiences of 1935 probably didn't care how these two were going to get together--as long as they did so, and happily. seen today, the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain "fancy free" in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off. nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure! this glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the london and venice settings, but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger. it's a fantasy for have-nots...ones who don't mind the dumbed-down plot. the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario, yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness. ** from ****

the proverb "never judge a book by it's cover", was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface. as i viewed the artwork to,"king of the ants" i instantly thought horror! the arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. instead what i discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock."king of the ants" features chris l. mckenna as sean crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. except sean crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did i feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. in fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as daniel baldwin (ray mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. throw in kari wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and george wendt as duke, which is basically a sober norm from cheers but mean!now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world. it prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogue, and unlikely event after unlikely event. oh the horror!

i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties. i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil. laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america. they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself "the devil" she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy. maidens are chained up. the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner. peter weston, is the devil hunter, who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her,

i was required to watch the movie for my work, so i didn't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but i still found the movie to suck far more than average. the jokes were lame, the two lead actresses... well, to use the "first wives club" division of women's ages in hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age but more in their "district attorney" age. what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized "beavis & butthead do america" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to "do his wife", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). all in all, a bland piece of crap.

i read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie. jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. the acting was below average most of the time, especially by mckenna. i haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone "badass" in a movie. oh man, this movie was a letdown. i also read somewhere this might be a cult classic. i know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film.the script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame.oh and pray for the guy that used to be in cheers. he looks really bad. the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.4/10

i don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so i hadn't brought any prejudices to the film. based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting.but implausibility was piled upon implausibility. each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed, gruesome makeup, or special effects.the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing. it was positively repulsive.i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore.chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim (wendt) out of the deep freeze. mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck. now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt's demise. (what are the cops going to do, measure his bite radius?) mckenna unwraps wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in, takes an ax, and begins to chop off wendt's head. whack. whack. whack. the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt's neck. the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh, one of which drops on mckenna's head. (he brushes it off when he's done.) mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built. he sits the head on the ground, squats next to it, takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed, and shows them to wendt's head. "remember her? we could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys," he tells the head. "duke, you've always liked bonfires, haven't you?" he asks. then he places the head on the fire. we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.i don't want this sort of garbage to be censored. i'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff.there's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie. well, i'll mention one example of an "implausibility," since i brought the idea up. mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. he knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days. (he's literally invited the heavies to do it.) what would you do in this poe-like situation? here's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life. he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). give that man the medal of freedom! a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. the camera is often hand held and wobbly. the dialog has lines like, "life is a piece of s***. or else it's the best of all possible worlds. it depends on your point of view." use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, mckenna, walks towards us in the foreground.some hero he is, too. he first kills a man for $13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body. (this bothers him a little, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) then, i hope i have the order straight, he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck. then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it, although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it. next he burns the head honcho (baldwin) alive. then, having disabled the two lesser heavies, he deliberately blows them up, though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic. and we're supposed to be rooting for mckenna.these aren't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either -- bang bang and you're dead. these are slow and painful. the first one -- the murder for $13,000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life. it isn't really easy to kill another human being, as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain. but that scene leads to no place of any importance.some people might enjoy this, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies. some meretricious stuff on screen here.

a film without conscience. drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. then they double cross him. meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and, without her knowing he's the killer, moves in with her. then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. then, in a walking tall kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him. the first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment, the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, worthiness, and heroism. we can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center. we just can't care about that kind of guy. and the wife (nicely played by the fetching kari wuhrer - the sheriff in eight legged freaks), a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband). and, when she finds out he's the guy  what does she do? she locks him inside her house (as if all houses had locks you can't open from inside) with her and proceeds to berate him. stoo-pid. george wendt, however, is terrific in a role as a beefy thug. director stuart gordon did so much better with re-animator and dagon.

i was p***ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year, so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, i put it on remind as soon as i could. so was it worth the wait? well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot. sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. enter duke (george wendt) who introduces him to his boss ray (danny baldwin). one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around. and it goes on from there. which leads me back to the question posed. was it worth the wait? yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me. he just took the ball and ran with it. but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. i know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the film. but needless to say it happened. the ending doesn't save the film either. poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like "re-animator" or "castle freak".my grade: cwhere i saw it: showtime extremeeye candy: kari wuhrer shows her ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and...oh my god my eyes my eyes!!!!!

i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful. an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man? this movie was rife with absurdities of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie. norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie. the acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. as a sane minded and rational individual, i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie. there was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended. one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie, it only makes a talkative train wreck.

this movie is written by charlie higson, who has before this done the "legendary" fast show and his own show based on one of fast show's characters (tony the car sales man). he's also written james bond books for kids.actually i've seen before this only gordon's movies that are based on lovecraft's stories, and every one of those is marvelous. here gordon tries to do something different. the style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. it works quite well here, i guess, but it's still pointless and cheap. it makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it). the casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good directing. i think the main character, the "zero" young guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". the fat guy is also good. and the guy who looks like alec baldwin, but is not him. but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. there is not much humanity in this film/story: it's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. needless to say that there is no humor either. it's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment. anyway, gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today, and i think of this movie as an experiment, and as a failure in that. everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes, just to learn and to find their way again. this might be gordon's most uninteresting and empty work.

this movie was an attempt to go into places most don't and perhaps shouldn't venture into. it was a similar trial at the bizarre, head-case perspective given to us in the cell, although not near as in-depth and well portrayed. the plot is constructed simply with an initial campy feel to it. then, as the movie takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart on what few legs it had to stand on in the first place. basically the idea is that of a kid (chris mckenna) who needs money. he takes on the role of a hit man, killing a city accountant. then he doesn't get paid for his work but instead gets tortured for several days because he dreamed up the "brilliant" idea of trying to use a backup file he had as leverage for payment. this idiotic move at trying to force them to pay him backfires as he is horribly and endlessly abused. he begins to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). then, thinking he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife (kari wuhrer) of the man who he killed and wins her affections. soon after she discovers who he is, tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps through the air as the boy goes after his torturers (daniel baldwin, george wendt, vernon wells) for their previous "kindness".i got to ask though, what is it with kari wuhrer and horror/gore type films?it seems everything she has put out lately has been in this genre. granted, i liked her in "eight-legged freaks" and she was okay in "anaconda". but despite all her obvious cuteness and allure (wow, she's hot!), she can act much better and chose better roles. or maybe, i'm wrong and that is just a misconception. for all you guys out there, you get to see the "fully monty" of her in this film, although it's rather bizarre and short-lived. i almost felt like she did some soft-porn after watching this film (something not foreign to kari's career). the sex-simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what things really go on during filming. anyway, i will say there is some good acting. just don't expect much of it from daniel balwin, whose career seems forever destined to second his brother alex's. the film did bring out a few old greats though, george wendt (norm from cheers) and vernon wells (commando, weird science). above all, chris mckenna does the best job in playing the main character, sean crawley. his little acting experience and yet his believable nature as a naive youth, bring some elements of substance to the film. i wouldn't go out of my way for this one. if you're bored and are tired of the same old episodes of "the hitchhiker", then i might advise watching this.and kari, please start acting in some better films!

you can't imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants. as a massive gordon fan, i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation.especially since i loved dagon - gordon's last achievement - so much. king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it. unfortunately, i couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards. king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. really, the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv-thriller standards. the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical gordon-touch is never recognized. on top of that, the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese! it involves a young wannabe-crook who's hired to commit a murder. so he does.and of course they're not paying him.and of course he falls in love with the victim's wife.and of course he avenges himself.. only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they're the only ones reminding you of the fact you're still watching a stuart gordon film. the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife, george `norm peterson' wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the make-up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur-horror fans. i read a few other comments on king of the ants, claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought-provoking and mature film.well, if that's the case.i rather stay immature and give re-animator another viewing, thank you very much. oh well, i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually.too bad it also overcame stuart gordon.

i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; "rated r for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language".which correctly, imo, should state ; "rated r for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language".the word "sexuality" should come after a "comma", not an "and" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non-existent. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like "vivid" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.of course, this is only my opinion.joseph

this was a crappy movie, with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count. i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (ron livingston) made a cameo in it, and i continued watching it because as a girl, i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change. later, i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get, and each time it got...more... ridiculous.sean crawley (good-looking chris l. mckenna, whom i've never seen before - but loved his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter, when he meets electrician duke wayne (george wendt from "cheers"). thinking he's getting more work from duke, sean agrees to meet contractor ray matthews (daniel baldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy). ray is being investigated by a city hall accountant (ron livingston in a cameo, who i've been in love with from "office space" up to "sex & the city"). ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for- cash sean $13k to kill the accountant, and sean accepts the job. sean stalks out the accountant, whose wife (kari wuhrer) he finds himself attracted to, completes the hit, and leaves - taking the file of information against ray with him. sean quickly learns he was being used, that ray never intended to pay him, and sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.up to this point, it's a descent flick...generally worth watching. but as soon as ray, duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him, it just got dumber and dumber (and still dumber...), until finally it seemed like the film's writer, charlie higson, had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. without simply detailing the movie, let's just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping, you find yourself gasping "what the f**k!," baffled by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. in the end, so many loose-ends are left in the movie, that you begin to regret that you even watched it.this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable, and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value. it's supposed to be a psychological thriller, and mckenna is a decent actor, but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have "norm" from "cheers" and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work, and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. guys will love the violence, blood and guts scenes, and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. girls will enjoy handsome sean's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie, when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie. personally, i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks (ron livingston) is only in the first one-third of the movie.

warning: avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed.pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing? trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy, just not working at all. pam and denise act so horribly in this movie.plus the script is absolutely atrocious, i can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. with the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.stay away from it. i think watch "white chicks" from 2004 it's so much better that this...make no mistake at that time i thought that's the worst movie i have ever seen.

i watched this film because i noticed that it had kari wuhrer in the cast. i have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget b movie. she is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material i always see her in. this is no different. the film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good. george wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. another note about ms. wuhrer. her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since i saw her last. perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. this not a bad thing. she still looks great. i would like to see her in a better movie.

i guess it's jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is, but empathy comes at a price like all things-when he's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. he is a joke as a mafia-hit-man(also because the part doesn't suit him one bit, him being so extroverted)and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in this.kathleen turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde, because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes, when she opens them wide which she's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute same(granted interesting) in everything, just like robert loggia. the movie is a lame draft(and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster-movie, with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster(they certainly gathered the party-going elite in this). what, did they shoot it in 1 day?-cause that would be the only explanation.

they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors,the budget,and the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic.strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very much.and also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action.maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later.

well then, what is it?! i found nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. angelica huston's character drained my power. and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut. it's not that i "don't get it". it's not that i don't think that some of the ideas could've lead to something more. this is a film with nothing but the notion that we're supposed to accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has going for it. that nicholson falls for turner is absurd, but then again, it is intended to be so. this however does not strike me as a.)funny, or b.)...even remotely interesting!!! this was a waste of my time, so don't let the hype get the best of you...it is a waste of your time! with all that being said, the opening church sequence is quite beautiful...

it's boggles the mind how this movie was nominated for seven oscars and won one. not because it's abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it really ought to deserve them but because in every category it was nominated prizzi's honor disappoints. some would argue that old hollywood pioneer john huston had lost it by this point in his career but i don't buy it. only the previous year he signed the superb under the volcano, a dark character study set in mexico, that ranks among the finest he ever did. prizzi's honor on the other hand, a film loaded with star power, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a major letdown.the overall tone and plot of a gangster falling in love with a female hit-man prefigures the quirky crimedies that caught hollywood by storm in the early 90's but the script is too convoluted for its own sake, the motivations are off and on the whole the story seems unsure of what exactly it's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga etc. jack nicholson (doing a brooklyn accent that works perfectly for de niro but sounds unconvincing coming from jack) and kathleen turner in the leading roles seem to be in paycheck mode, just going through the motions almost sleepwalking their way through some parts. anjelica huston on the other hand fares better but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivations: she starts out the victim of her bigot father's disdain, she proves to be supportive to her ex-husband, then becomes a vindictive bitch that wants his head on a plate.the colours of the movie have a washed-up quality like it was made in the early 70's and huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. there's promise behind the story and perhaps in the hands of a director hungry to be recognized it could've been morphed to something better but what's left looks like a film nobody was really interested in making.

this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) it wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful jean marsh.the popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly. in fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as i speak.robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one. her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element. instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.the twilight zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. normally no one cared. but this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright carelessness.

a vampire's's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror-comedy. i can't explain all the positive comments on this movie. i'll chalk it up to mass hallucination, but it's disconcerting none the less. the one redeeming factor (and this is me being extremely generous here) might be the grandfather who's the only semi-likable character in this whole mess. don't waste your money, or time. in fact here's a word of advice, if troma puts it out on dvd, but does not make it themselves, in all likelihood it's crap.troma dvd extras:commentary with omar and kirk; second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; troma interactivity; radiation march; clip from "terror firmer"; theatrical trailer ;trailers for "the rowdy girls", "teenage catgirls in heat", "cannible: the musical", and "toxic avenger 4" my grade: d

a female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. she has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker. after a few kills, the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl.what can i say about this movie ? that its pacing is over-slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and ambiance (new jazz here i come) and that lights don't seem to be included on the set. it looks like an "auteur" horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside.the plot is completely stupid and as you can guess, it's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she doesn't have to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks don't work.it's not even a funny lousy movie. perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers, it can't have its funny sides (to be honest, it's funny during 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie). don't be fooled by the troma sticker, it's one the bad movie they present.

i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt. the opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. turns out this initial impression turns out false. oh, troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). this is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapel's bargain basement direction.and it's not without him trying, oh lord no. he does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. he and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they're used in the movie made i, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. while this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary (and it isn't) or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.it's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to near dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's blood freak. you have better ways to waste your time, overall.

unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated english film. although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins. richard burton sleepwalks through his role, and sophia loren's closed (in this movie) face doesn't display much passion, either. (**)

remakes (and sequels) have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the media. it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though. if you take what's good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards, you can have a success. note, such films like the thief of bagdad (1924/1940) or king kong (1933/2005) succeeded in their attempts. others like king kong (1976) fail, miserably.brief encounter (1945) is the template for this film. it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb**********ten. the story is simple, love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. why, it just happened for the two (2) principals involved at the wrong time. these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson. neither are conventionally leading star material, but quality character actors. for the details watch the film.now what went wrong? a t.v. movie, remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb******six. both actors though appear disinterested, just showing up to punch their time-clocks and pick up their checks. neither are involved with their characters or with each other. you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them. that should not be and that's why it fails in its intent. sometimes it is just better to leave things alone.

brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic, which was based on noel coward's play "still life". a doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of italian ancestry. they meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every wednesday. the pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part. coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. sophia loren and richard burton, two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'. loren in particular is miscast - sophia loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a citizen advice bureau just doesn't ring true. burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across as your average general practitioner. that said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. loren's husband, jack hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous. their final scene together will induce nausea, ("you've been a long, long way away", etc.). that great british jobbing actor, john lemesurier, has a three minute cameo as burton's friend, and appears to be slightly inebriated, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. it's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal, awful rehash of a cinema classic. avoid at all costs.

this movie is a waste of film stock. do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? it happened in this film. do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a "negro" unit...cooking, supply services, burial detail, etc.? it happened in this film. do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would select this same deaf k.p. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived? it happened in this film. would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn't realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him? it happened in this film. would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold-up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50' away? they did it in this film, and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected. would you believe that, over the airwaves and in clear english, the captain mentioned the general's rank, if not his name, as the person he was speaking with and that the general, in plain english over open airwaves, said that the dam had to be protected the next day? maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans. this so-called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst films. if it were, i'm sure it would do well. watch it at your own risk.

at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick, and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction. however, the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected, and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army. the recognizable cast is hit and miss, with glynn turman, richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring best. stephen boyd, however, stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn.the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values. the locations are great, the effects and action are weak. imagine if "saving private ryan" had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel's caparzo had (except we do get to see the shot because they effects can't handle it), then hanks, damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax. yet, the denouement, with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black, and boyd's racist captain being effected by this, is compelling, as are the sequences of of turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines.in short, "black brigade/carter's army" doesn't quite succeed. but it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. it could be remade as a very good film, and, as it stands, is an interesting effort.

this movie has richard pryor, rosey grier and others. it's a curious ww2 movie, and serves as a statement about racism. it is worth watching to understand the fact that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period of time they portray. meaning this is a 70's movie not a 40's movie (ww2). still, there is some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. the story centers on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. there is a scene that could be from a civil war movie and not a ww2 movie that reflects what the movie is all about. the black lt. gives a german women a innocent peck on the cheek, and the white capt becomes upset. i enjoyed the movie from a curiosity stand point since the stars and the genre were interesting to me.

the writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but i still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.the action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. seeing new york giant rosie greer was worth the buck i paid for this. the art direction is fifth rate--the men wear korean war uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the u.s. army reached germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and i don't think the terrain resembled northern california. the script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. there is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying springfield rifles instead of m-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.this basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. you have to take this for what it is, and i admire the creators of this film for making the effort.i remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.

this movie was just down right bad. i love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that i liked,but this was not one of them. this movie lacked substance and intensity.ok i get it, the finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great, but the story is poorly told. you don't have any real connection with any of the characters and there's no real story line to follow. you just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed. if you want a war movie that will keep you riveted, and amazingly enough without battles scenes, then i would suggest "downfall" (wwii german film). or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then i would suggest "brotherhood of war" (korean war/korean film). these two movies will not let you down as winter war will.

i voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output. however it was his usual mix of "art" sex and pretentious crap.i know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly. it is definitely not for everyone. the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for crediblity's sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time. i hate to consign anyone to pseud's corner but please.....!!! on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies. i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable!!

i really wanted to like the pillow book. intriguing story, interesting character outlines, ewan macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. unfortunately, i hated every minute of it. greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. i won't even get into vivian wu's abysmal acting.you get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. it seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. it's a bit like presenting a john singer sargeant portrait in a chintzy hallmark frame that says "grandma loves me!" in big sparkly letters.this movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. in another director's hands (jeunet? coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece. in greenaway's hands, it's best relegated to fine arts classes that also take themselves too seriously.

this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin.the plot is absolutely bizarre. i fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. the plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography. in addition, the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying bad parts of hong kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. throughout the whole film, i keep thinking that "the pillow book" is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment."the pillow book" is a perverted, yet boring film. seriously stay away from it.

visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing rubbish. not even close to greenaway's better work. avoid at all costs!the overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme.there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring.plus, how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me. he showed more ability in the star wars series, and that's saying something.i've not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw 'darby o'gill and the little people'!

the potential movie extravaganza, set during the 19th century, failed to produce. with big-name actors like maggie smith, albert finney, and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. however, the movie lacked an ending, had a sorry excuse for a plot line, and fell to pieces with its continuity. a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, brought together by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father. the father, played by finney, is a disturbed man, tormenting his daughter in life as well as death. he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status. the actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline. washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch. i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. save yourself, stay clear of washington square.

it's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films. while the heiress was a good, if not entirely accurate, adaptation, washington square is a heavy-handed and poorly acted, except for the part of dr sloper, film that could have been so much better.the director's attempts at making 'beautiful' scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed. it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have, such as onegin. i agree with other comments about leigh's portrayal of catherine as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her not feel for her.catherine's transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, was internalised, just as it was in the novel. but we don't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film! i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool.i appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just didn't work.

this adaptation, like 1949's *the heiress*, is based on the henry james novel. *the heiress*, starring olivia de havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to james' original story than this new remake, which retains james' original title. it is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (leigh), devoted to her father (finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. when a young man (chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. she's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly  it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. while the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin (previously seen in *the truth about cats and dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? this is only one instance where *washington square* differs from *the heiress*. another instance is the ability to stick with it. it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.

a real blow-up of the film literally. this british film is boringly made.what an exciting plot! a terrorist places bombs on a train. how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story?glenn ford, as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb, is given awful writing material to work with. naturally, just as he is called in, his wife, anne vernon, is about to leave him. no wonder we never heard of miss vernon. after such a film, it would be enough to end her career.that elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia. i thought it was highly insulting to show this man, even at the end.

when i first saw this movie, it was titled terror on a train and was the back half of a double feature. glenn ford, an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives. the tension is slow and steady; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes. all these years later on tv; the tension and drama has lost most of its impact. this is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go.along with ford are anne vernon and maurice denham. the villain/saboteur is played by victor maddern.

this is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most. great cast, great director, great story potential, then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere...and says nothing while going there! there is no depth here whatsoever. no depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, suspense, or common sense. we know what's happening, we are told how they plan to fix the problem, they fix the problem, throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense, then they end the film abruptly. wasted opportunity.on the plus side, glenn ford leads a cast of uk (and one french) actors who are all fantastic, doing an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they were given. one of the absolute favorites is herbert walton as "old charlie", who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film. i also thought the film had a great look to it...all shadows and fog...very film noir in feel.even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable, it still just isn't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film. there are far better glenn ford movies out there: the big heat, gilda, affair in trinidad, etc.

i was interested in the title and description of big rig while attending the sxsw film festival in austin, tx. however, i was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as big rig ended. big rig is comprised of several "big rig" drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the united states. the characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. at most, we get lost. we - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. why are we here? where are we? how did we get here? the storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on "humanizing" a group of people who they regard as "overlooked" and "invisible" comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. the problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. the directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of "so what" is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of see-through propaganda that does nothing to further "enlighten" (as the directors claim) the outside world about big riggers.

i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.the acting is really good. dabney coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. dolly partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here. jane fonda is so-so and does little for me. lily tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, gotta love her.i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy. i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like. it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters. they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' i just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true.4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you haven't seen it. i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable.

i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! they are rich little kids who don't have any talent, and probably just begged nick to accept them! alex has played the drums for one yearm, i've played for 4 1/2! the movie is terrible and so is the show! this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen. it is so stupid it makes me want to barf!!! it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb! they are sooo stupid and weird! i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off!

okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. first off the movie is so posed and not real, they are all acting. they can't sing. they are way too full of themselves. its awful. yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid. i mean they say their manager is a kid. and there record label is fake. its stupid. don't see it.as for the set up and directing, not so bad. it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing. only see this if you don't really like good music. also, it's very corny. it's not even tasteful. i hate to be so mean...but this really is a piece of junk.

i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? so what if their ten, it's way too immature for a little kid to sing about "being my women" i mean seriously! the name is pretty corny too, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants??? how creative.i don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves, especially the naked brothers band. heck how many of them are in the freaking group. and seriously whats with the movie? jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band? so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked brother's band, its a stupid, uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv.

wow, the naked brothers band. what should i say. i guess i can say this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can't even play the instruments. number 2: on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on. look, i really don't hate it that bad, i'd give it like a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. deep my ass! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that. and they didn't get famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show. i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.

when a man who doesn't have alzheimer's can't remember how many films he's made, he probably is the world's most prolific director after all. that man is jesus franco, the king of so-called 'eurotrash'. his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading, for starters) as any other franco film i've seen. that makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while you're mostly waiting for them to end because they're so very tedious.devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america. there's lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole. you need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are franco's main methods of extending a film out to feature length.the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet jesus!).anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. the flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half brooklyn-american, half english-liverpudlian and all retarded. all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. the nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but it's gotta be done at some point, and it's nice to note that the director will show anyone's genitals on camera.the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming. franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making, but he doesn't muck around with sets. you get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam.ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. if you're trying to see all the video nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and you'll be made as restless as i was. if you like franco, you'll watch this anyway. if you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are you'll never come across this film. copies of it aren't just lying around, and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. it's franco. lazy, crazy franco.

i totally hated the movie. it was so retarded. they need to get some acting lessons....no, wait, that won't help because the naked brothers band people a retards. you know why i am here even though i am a naked brothers band hater? to warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the nbb doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. not only are the song lyrics retarded, they sing badly. okay, i'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways, it was boring and they acted horribly. it was not funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. i guess they deserve some credit for that...well, the movie isn't worth your time. just look at its rating. the movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain. seriously, if you liked it, you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines in a monotone. i am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually better than those nat and alex guys. hurry before it's too late! i seriously thought that herbie fully loaded was better than this piece of poopie. i don't even know why i went through even half of that film. i don't think it even deserves to be called a film...

it's terrible how some people can get away with such things... this is one of those overrated things again... and i hate things that are overrated that are no good... why can't we have more tv shows and movies that actually have a story and excellent music and that are well written and are actually about something?? it takes many people to make this movie, the series, and the band, all possible, and those people are all wasting their time... it seems that the bands are getting younger and younger... i looked at how small that they were, and i thought that they were 5 or 6. it's sad that kids are performing that young... they are still too young... performing takes a lot of work, and they have many other things that they need to do with their lives... the idea about having a very young band is horrible... they need to stop having bands like this... and i don't like the idea at all, nor the kids themselves... they are very annoying, very young, and their name is "the naked brothers band" the people that are involved in this, and the people that are supporting this have all lost their minds... whenever this band is shown on tv, change the channel, and petition to get it banned...and i know that this is a very boring comment thing, but you get the point...this band sucks... get rid of it...

i hate this movie. i hate the show. i hate just about everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. everyone's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they're going to make it big. what kind of drugs are you taking???!!!?!?!?!?! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like jane hudson from "whatever happened to baby jane?". i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one, barely 30 seconds of the show, and i managed to survive about half an hour of 'battle of the bands'. how anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the kid's choice awards, i have no clue. days before the movie premiere on nick, most of the teen girl actresses on nick (jamie spears, emma roberts, lindsey shaw, etc.) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are. first off, they didn;t trick me, and second of all, nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing, because i don't see how anyone could find this show/movie entertaining. the music is just awful. nat's singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. alex is the most annoying movie/tv show character ever. he's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls. this guy's lucky if he ever manages to get laid. you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters (in real life) don't even exist!! the character jesse is actually played by nat and alex's cousin jesse draper (they mustve had some budget problem). their father is not single, he's married to polly draper, but she doesn't appear on the show, making it seem the wolff's are mom-less. rosalina doesn't exist either. her name is allie dimeco. i'll tell ya, the naked brothers are gonna be in some deep sh** when their "fans" find out the whole thing is staged. 0/10

"show me your boobies!" is not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i'm coming from. i don't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that. i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then that's what we get, stupid little kids acting like stupid adults. i know it's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and 1st grade who can't wait to see this. i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it. my daughters won't be watching it. i'd love to block nick but don't have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i'll have to.

a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap. at least the music in spinal tap was good.this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it's worst. a bunch of hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers create some "poopie" show so their kids can be in the spotlight. oh please!!! the potty humor was even bad. i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along.help u all!!!! why wasn't gene simmons in it??? ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet.

my favorite memory of this show and the band was when i got together with a bunch of my friends which are nbb haters and had a big bonfire and we took a cd of their songs and the dvd of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing "ding dong the witch is dead". that was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol god this show sucks. i hate it so much. get rid of the crappy car. you guys really suck! you really ruined the whole channel! no offence or anything but you guys need to get a life, i mean, really, who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can't even sing! you guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something, except roselina. she's really pretty. but still, you guys reak!

that's right, you heard me this movie is a freaking' abomination. first off, the band, who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called "the naked brothers band"?!?! not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians, they can't even play anything! also, the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee, and even more his voice is horrible! not only are they terrible musicians but they're terrible actors. led by a crappy director and thin plot, this has got to be the dumbest movie ever. i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10, because giving this filth a 1/10 is being way too generous.i'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film. if you're looking for comedy with music, go to that "weird al" yankovic guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens.

omg this was the most painful experience of my life watching this. i could even finish it what is happening to nick. their best thing on teen nick is drake and josh and thats about to go off air. the kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids. my little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said " one of the worst shows that i have ever saw so boring." my little brother actually fell asleep i envy him. in short if your 3yrs old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.

oh dear! the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot "johny test" while we were playing video games. i thought he was confusing "johny quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons i've ever seen in my life", and changing the "quest" with "test". its something weird that i'm wrong, but actually i was wrong, he wasn't changing nothing, he heard of this show.one day, while watching tv, i heard that cartoon network was going to be released. i wasn't sure of what was the plot of this show, so i adventured myself to watch it, and here is my answer "i want my damn hour back" (because i watched this crap and "my gym partner's a monkey".this is one of the worst shows i've ever seen. first, the beginning, with the most stupid song in the world, then the plot. oh, where are my manners? i haven't said the plot of this show. is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters, that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother. ohhh, now i see why his name is johny test, he is the test of his sisters experiments.you know, i honestly miss dexter's lab (before it was transformed to the new dexter, a total crap too). this is a bad copy of that old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. don't watch it, make something more productive in that half-hour than watch this crap.

cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings. beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack, the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular, such as the powerpuff girls, dexter's lab, dragonball z, etc. when the ratings started to plummet, cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows. though total drama island/action and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience-pleasing gimmicks, there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes (george of the jungle) or rip offs of other shows, such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack, where the title character acts just like spongebob, and then there's johnny test, which is something of a replacement for dexter's laboratory, though it's much more of a sheer rip off than anything.the show's characters are clearly derived from dexter's lab, only this time the focus is on johnny, a blonde (or fiery-haired) character who torments his twin sisters, susan and mary, who just happen to look just like dexter, from the orange hair, to the glasses, the impossible technology. there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene, who appears to be sitting in for mandark. then there's dookie, johnny's best friend and talking dog, one of dexter's...i mean, susan and mary's early experiments.dexter's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television, with its simple, but effective art style, lovable main character, and episodes that don't seem to be a long drag. johnny test is a lot different. the art style here isn't nearly as eye-pleasing. in fact, it looks absolutely awful. the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive. like how most of the series' episodes consist johnny and dookie's quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy, whom johnny secretly likes, or the twins' obsession over a boy next door. seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with, there is no real connection between the viewer and characters.one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and mary's guinea pig for their experiments. these range from turning johnny fat, ugly, monstrous, and even into a woman. the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme he's planning in return for his services. whenever there's an episode involving this kind of "win/win" deal, it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesn't come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly.the writing ranges from mediocre to horrid, however. the 'fat' episode constantly repeats "it's phat with a ph. there's a difference, you know." which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity, with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat.let's talk about how the show doesn't completely rip off dexter's lab. the show tosses in a lot of characters, from two men-in-black named mr. black and mr. white, a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters, and lots of super villains, though even here, the show again steals ideas for other sources, like a mr. freeze teenage clone, an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man (like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls), a bumbling maniac mastermind, a trio of evil skater 'dudes' and even a mole man, which is probably the most cliché villain in the media.to top it all off, alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters, the voice acting is either passable (like the voices for mr. black and mr. white) to just plain ear-splitting (johnny, dookie, and just about every villain in the show). the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show, but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it.so in the end, johnny test is not a good cartoon. its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children's interest in the show, while its bright coloring, ripped-off characters, and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens. it's just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over-promoting to trick people to watching it (like mtv toward rap). if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour, you'd better stick to spongebob, because johnny test is more of a "test" of patience than anything else.

my brother is in love with this show, let's get this straight. i completely agree with the people who said it was copying off of dexter's lab and fairly odd parents. i've never really liked fairly odd parents, i mean, some things did make me laugh, but most of the time it's downright annoying and not cute at all. this is almost the same way i feel about johnny test. except, nothing makes me laugh on that show. the gags are so stupid and pointless, and to tell you the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids don't dress like that! yes, i do think johnny's hair is awesome, but c'mon!and dexter's lab, that used to be one of my favorite shows and i still don't mind watching it. which makes me disgusted and ashamed of johnny test making an absolute joke out of that wonderful show!one more thing. the. dog. is. so. annoying. he is more loud and obnoxious than johnny! and the gay accent? what the fudge! i hate the dog to death and i hope he dies, because that would be better for kids to see than listening and watching the obnoxious crap that goes on in that show, and picking up a gay accent.unless you want you eyeballs to burn into miraculous flames and your brain fried from this show, don't watch it!

i really hate this show! i had watched one episode, and i knew this show is really terrible. the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad...i mean it is just a sh++ty rip-off of dexter's laboratory and johnny quest, 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog; a stay-at-home dad and a smart, super-busy mom...like oh-my-flippin'-god! their dad is a mother-f**kin' crazy home-maker, isn't that so gay! if my dad is a home-maker, i would personally die! of shame that is...really i would.i have nothing else to about this...this travesty but only 3 word; count them 3 words to describe it:· lame, · stupid, and above all... · f**k up! that's all i could say folks, it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev-er! if i had one that is.

this show is possibly the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam pile i've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful. the lead character, johnny, while i understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid, isn't likable or even tolerable. the jokes are lame, overdone (i.e. the "whoa! didn't see that coming" gag. come on, that wasn't even funny the first time. it's not even cute) and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration. and lastly... it's just plain ugly to look at. while kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. i can't stand watching the show, because in a way, the art style is just...gross. hideous, in fact. just plain crummy. i just can't stand that this is getting so much airtime. while i understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and i shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back... i really miss the old cartoons. bring back dexter's laboratory, the powerpuff girls... anything but this crap. i guess it's just wishful thinking though.simply put, i advise you don't waste your time on this show. i believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids, too. and this doesn't cut it.

as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don't like johnny test. now i think i know what people are going to say, " how do you know how bad it is? have you ever watched it?", i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards.i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen. like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation. i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show. it tries way too hard to be like dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female. there is a talking dog(why?), and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat. i have others but i don't think i can write them here ( i don't mean cursing but i mean i don't know if there is a limit for words.). everything else though is spot on, even a deedee character johnny himself. it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.lastly i want to talk about the jokes. remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling? yes, yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke. johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears. that isn't comedy, thats stupid comedy (i know what some people are thinking. isn't three stooges stupid comedy? watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option.). sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which, like chowder, makes me mad. i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: to much bizarre doesn't equal comedy, it makes you just think "what am i watching?".so it strikes out on all accounts. don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway, shape, or form.

i want so badly to give this piece of garbage a zero, unfortunately, there isn't, so, i had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is! the characters look like they were drawn by pre-schoolers, no, wait, i've seen pre-schoolers do better! i prefer "misadventures of flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! i'm probably saying what others have said, two words: rip off!! remember that episode of dexter's lab when they raced go-karts down that volcano? yeah, mister fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed! they even ripped off shadow lugia in that one episode that parodied pokemon!(he even cashed in on that franchise!) that one character is a cheap rip off of mandark from dexter's lab! mister fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap!! everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like johnny (rip-off) test, your'e just lying to yourselves. do yourself a favor, change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen!

i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it. i failed, horribly. cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences, but johnny test is "entertainment" in it's lowest form. the writing is incredibly predictable, and the running gags aren't much gags at all. kids will love it, and that's about it.now, this isn't to say that it's all bad. the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat. it's a shame, because that was really one of the best things it had going for it.some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. with a little work, the characters could work well together, but they're too one-dimensional. then again, this makes it easy for the kids to follow. the pace is a bit too fast as well. the episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. this is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth. on the upside, however, the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest, and that's really the entirety of the target audience.overall, the show looks very good on paper, but just doesn't succeed in being funny or interesting. this is a show i want to like, but i'm incapable of it. there's just so much potential that isn't realized. kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.

this show is dull, lame, and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it "original." first off: the animation is so ugly... johnny's hideous... and everyone's annoying. the twins look like teen female dexters from "dexter's lab," and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee (also from "dexter's lab.") secondly: the plots... are painfully lame, making them hard to follow. the gags are corny, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit... especially when it tries to be funny. i only saw two episodes, but those alone turned me off.third off: the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green day's "american idiot." and, while i am not a big fan of that band, i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody, and then subtly change it, in order to make it their own.case in point... it's a big fat ugly bore. 1/10

and how it made it into production astounds me. the main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. i can't stand the character at all. he's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years, no joke. the story lines are both poorly written and executed. the jokes are as bad as the ones on disney's sweet life of zack and cody. i could not dislike this show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. even the theme song is bad. the title, even worse.it's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor.johnny test, go away far and fast!

there are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset.but it's basically more of a made for tv movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish, so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost.i had it as a xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in "a time to kill" , and the "the newton boys " so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work.however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view.the films star though, patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a rom com.so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i've seen, i'd recommend, "a time to kill" , "the newton boys " "frailty", "how to lose a guy in 10 days", "edtv" and "amistad" and avoid too "larger than life" and "angels in the outfield" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines.as for scorpion springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either.

a very cheesy and dull road movie, with the intention to be hip and modern, shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles, resulting only in sleepiness. the cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and pretentious. the only thing worthwhile is the top-notch lalo schifrin's soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. run if you can, the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved; it is really pure garbage. of course that this has its charm, of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire, but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do.

that's right, you heard me. i am a huge fan of james patterson. i own 10 of his books, and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer. in my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre? if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered, then michael o'hara has proved me wrong. i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice. to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy: don't quit your day job.

the word "1st" in the title has more ominous meaning for the viewers of this film than for its crime victims. at least they don't have to stick around and watch this interminable film reach its own demise.1st should refer to: 1st draft of a script; 1st takes used in each performance in the final film; 1st edit in post production; etcetera, etcetera.the movie is not cast too badly, it's just that everything about the film come off as worse than third rate, from the goofy script, to the wooden performances. and while suffering through this cobbled together film, by the 2 hour mark you want to be put out of your misery. at 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours.going into details concerning the lame script and acting serves little purposes. even in the equally awful, lake placid, at least the performances bill pullman and bridget fonda constructed out of an extremely weak script, were nuanced enough to make you laugh at the movie. in 1st to die, one ends up grieving only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the female lead's suicide.the editing is so bad one is never introduced to one of the main characters, who i think (were never quite told) is a d.a. she just appears in one scene in the middle of a conversation. obviously the scene where she is introduced to the viewer was dropped on the editor's floor. and no one realized that a character appearing out of nowhere was an unusual film ploy.in a word, don't waste your time with this one. my wife and i wish we didn't. but at least we created our own diversions by commenting in various places in the film like it was mystery science theater. "meanwhile, in cleveland . . . ." !!!!

first to die 2003i'll admit my mistake first: i didn't realize this was a made for tv movie. i was "thrown off" by the "r" certification. the plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. the direction and continuity were excellent. for the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. the down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call for an "r" rating. there is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes. actually, there are no sex scenes. ona grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), kristina copeland, sonya salomaa, and glynis davies were all guests on the sg-1 series, but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses. robert patrick was fantastic, as he usually is and mitch pileggi made me think of a modern day lee marvin. the very talented megan gallagher who i came to respect as an actor during the millennium series, was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities. the greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was tracy pollan. aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. i found myself muting the tv during her dialogue. i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the lifetime tv type of programs. i would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however. considering i found nothing that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on tv, since nothing will be cut out. as a tv movie i would rate this as a 5 out 10. as a feature film with an "r" certification and such as strong cast, i rate it as a 2 out of ten.

having not read the novel, i can't tell how faithful this film is. the story is typical mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays. the first 2/3 are dull, save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.acting is strictly sub par, though it's hard to blame the actors alone: the screenplay is atrocious. during the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting, but that's only the last 1/3. director russell mulcahy is very much in his element, but there's only so much he can do with a tv budget and the network censors on his back. he's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses, though he managed to squeeze in a couple "under the floor" shots during the murders in the club restroom. unfortunately, as this is made for tv, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.summing it up: this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by tv standards(watch csi, instead). if you're in the mood for a film like this, i've some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of dario argento's "deep red"(my highest recommendation; superb film), "opera", or even "tenebre". they're stronger in every category.

another wonderful patterson book made into an incredibly awful movie. if the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t.v. movie that's 10 times worse! i am desperate for a good movie that will do one of his books justice!

i love a good sappy love story (and i'm a guy) but when i rented "love story" i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw's character.ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first 15 minutes. when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care. if she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce court.people love this movie but it's one of the worst of the 70's.

one of the previous reviewers wrote that there appeared to be no middle ground for opinions of love story; one loved it or hated it. but there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions throughout the scale of 1 to 10. for me, this movie rated a 4. there are some beautiful scenes and locations, and ray milland turns in a fabulous job as oliver's father. but the movie did not do a particularly compelling job of telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to warrant multiple viewings, at least, not for me. i may be a bit of a snob, but i tend to avoid movies with ryan o'neal -- i still haven't seen barry lyndon -- because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. the lone exception is what's up, doc?, in which his straight performance is the perfect underlining for barbra streisand's goofball protagonist -- and, not coincidentally, he takes a shot at love story for good measure! mcgraw and o'neal tend to mug their lines, rather than act them.this movie is notable for the beginning of one fine career: it was tommy lee jones's first movie.

this 1970 hit film has not aged well, but frankly, it was not that good when it was released. yet, it was a hugely popular success perhaps because the idea of fatalistic young love must have appealed to audiences saturated by constant tv coverage of the vietnam war. the plot is pure drivel as it concerns oliver barrett iv, a privileged harvard hockey player, who meets and falls in love with jenny cavelleri, an antagonistic vassar music student proud of her working class background. his old-school father naturally disapproves of jenny, and in a typical act of rebellion, that means the young couple gets married in one of those hippie-era, extemporaneous ceremonies. he lands his dream job in new york, but she gets unexpectedly ill and dies of her terminal disease. there is a veneer of then-contemporary film-making techniques displayed by director arthur hiller, but none of that can hide the old-fashioned, cliché-ridden story at its core. the inevitable ending left me particularly unmoved.both ryan o'neal and ali macgraw became stars with this movie as oliver and jenny but inexplicably so since neither seems able to convey the depth or complexity required to make their characters compelling. at least the boyish o'neal is sincere in his weakly defiant approach, but macgraw is so wooden and smirky in behavior that it's hard to see what oliver sees in jenny beyond her sarcastic façade. john marley (two years before finding the decapitated racehorse in his bed in "the godfather") does better as jenny's plainspoken baker father phil, as does ray milland as the seemingly insensitive barrett paterfamilias. the overly familiar frances lai music has almost become parody in itself over the years. the print quality on the dvd is good, though the only extra is a rather effusive commentary track by hiller. the most interesting bit of trivia is that author erich segal (upon whose book this movie is based) conceived oliver as a mix between two harvard roommates he knew  vice president al gore and actor tommy lee jones, who happens to have a bit part in the movie as one of oliver's roommates.

**** spoiler warning ****absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. totally impossible to take any of this seriously. it would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it. during the glory days of her program, carol burnett and company, who often did take-offs on films, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine. carol played jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from. harvey korman played oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked ryan o'neal. the only thing funnier than this bit, is the real film.what a death scene at the end. jenny really looks like she's dying alright...dying for her make-up artist to come in and give her a little color. and of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient's final moments. the ending scene with ryan o'neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic. he had plenty to worry about. he never did recover from this.

a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father (ray milland).syrupy, sugary, and most of all, sappy story about a battle of the 'classes' when rich-kid ryan o'neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule. ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout-catholic father, but no one in the film is more annoying than o'neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard's champion yuppie.followed 8(!) years later by 'oliver's story'.

i've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraw's in this movie. god is she bothersome or what?! she says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, ryan o'neal is brilliant. there is not much of a story. he's rich, she's wooden, they both have to sacrifice a lot for love. his father is stonewall jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love. the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year. john marley is fine as wooden's father, but a supporting nomination? at least ali didn't win. i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies. she's certainly a better actress than mcgraw. i didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad. it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good. but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long, and the sin of that is its not that old, but it feels it.

a very slick modern (keeping it sensually hip) revamp on the dracula story (although staying with the traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness. the first time i tried watching it i could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits new orleans to focus on van helsing's daughter. a great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where dracula could flourish). produced by wes carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by patrick lussier. artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. the messy script does get considerably silly. lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of "virgin" advertising. no i don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and helsing's daughter works there too. oh that wasn't obvious planting. the soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (danny masterson, sean patrick thomas, nathan fillion, shane west and lochlyn munro). gerard butler as dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. he was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; jennifer esposito, colleen fitzpatrick and jeri ryan as dracula's brides. the likes of jonny lee millar and justine waddell are respectably okay. christopher plummer gives out a grizzled turn as van helsing and omar epps has fun with his role.

put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle: a thrash-metal updating of "dracula", with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker (who probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway) and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore. christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the modern-day--not just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing; he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count dracula's corpse, which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van helsing's vault and flown to new orleans. this is just what new orleans needs in the 21st century! the film, well-produced but without a single original idea (except for multi-racial victims), is both repulsive and lazy, and after about an hour starts repeating itself. * from ****

dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast on network television tonight . actually seeing as i`m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . my theory was proved right for the most part !!!!! minor spoilers !!!!!what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . for example early in the film the bad guys are flying dracula`s coffin from london to america ( in a twin engine turbo prop plane ! ) and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where dracula comes to life . a fight breaks out , there`s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don`t hear a sound until the script demands it . it also appears in this segment`s climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there`s numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced there`s something else that yanked my chain - product placement . there`s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record label/retailer chain is in full view . i won`t dare publicise the company brand ( except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain ) but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british broadcasting guidlines and i`m surprised the bbc showed this movie if that`s the case there are some positives in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example . this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it`s something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years - a very good looking movie that`s very dumb

this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen. this movie has nothing positive about it. some of you people actually like this movie! i've seen a lot of dracula movies and i've liked everyone that i've seen, but when i saw this movie i said to myself, "what the hell is this?" what a stupid movie. now they have dracula becoming who he is because he is judas. for those of you who don't know who judas is, he betrayed jesus christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself. you have to be kidding me. that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard for why dracula became evil. who asked for a reason anyway? what a piece of sh** this movie is. who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten. even the dracula is horrible. if you ever saw this movie you wouldn't even think it was dracula. wow, dracula 2000! is that title supposed to impress me? don't waste your time or your money on this trash.

this film is really bad. it maybe harsh, but it is. it really is. poor script, every vampire cliché in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole dracula. there have been some truly brilliant dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the "dire" slot.take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - dracula 2000.i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent ... whats the problem with that i hear you cry ... well, he is english, but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent.all in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the tellytubbies.p.s. although la la is pretty frightening!

please don't waste your time. this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker's dracula (van helsing), anne rice's vampire lestat (rock music and silly biblical references), and blade (high-tech toys). i really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good . but not this stinker. not even the soundtrack helps it, mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the "kick-ass metal" some reported. only a few times did i hear any metal; mostly it was tortured violins. avoid it like garlic and crucifixes.

i saw this movie for 2 reasons--i like gerard butler and christopher plummer. unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie. i liked the idea that dracula is actually a reincarnation of judas iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself.

lois weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to tcm. this film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. if you have wondered what tyrone power, jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. it's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.

this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. a wealthy upper class english woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. there's a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. but naturally there's a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.the wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for romance will overlook that.

the spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, the lady barbara skelton, gets raped and gunned down in the end. and not a moment too soon. i'd have shot the screen myself but i was afraid i'd hit james mason.the original 1943 novel, called "the life and death of the wicked lady skelton" (i guess people didn't whine about spoilers back then), was written by a woman, an english navy brat who was either troubled or cynical or both. her heroine is devastatingly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. but other things do matter, such as the fact that lady barbara's immediate and only response when someone gets in her way is homicide. she murders three men in five attempts. a serial femme fatale, she's got a case of dissocial personality disorder that should have landed her in either bedlam or newgate. lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vamp, wearing so much makeup that i thought of her as a restoration-era joan rivers (or a restoration-era joan rivers, ha!). yet lady b. is irresistible to all three principal male characters-- michael rennie, james mason, and griffith jones, all of whom do good work, as does patricia roc. of course, all three admirers realize in short order what a psychotic bitch barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally does gun her down - accidentally, in what is meant to be either irony or just desserts. given the dramatic death scene with a boom lifting the camera out through the windows and heavenward, i presume we're meant to give a damn about her death. but hers is the first corpse we don't care about.

bad actors, terrible script, totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all. after seeing films like this, you wonder why the makers bothered at all. this film has absolutely nothing to say, all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films. a total waste of time.

this time we get a psycho toy maker named "joe petto" (get it?) who makes living, evil toys that kill people. he goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "pino" (again, get it?) used to live.easily the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the last) in this semi - series, this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies, but without the sex and nudity. it's kind of like a low rent hybrid of "halloween iii", "puppet master", "dolls" and bad home movies. supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. we can all only hope that it stays that way...1/2 a star out of ****

silent night, deadly night 5 is the very last of the series, and like part 4, it's unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that it's a christmas-themed horror flick.except to the oblivious, there's some obvious things going on here...mickey rooney plays a toymaker named joe petto and his creepy son's name is pino. ring a bell, anyone? now, a little boy named derek heard a knock at the door one evening, and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him. even though it said "don't open till christmas", he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. inside is a little red ball that sprouts santa arms and a head, and proceeds to kill dad. oops, maybe he should have left well-enough alone. of course derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs, but he doesn't grow up to be some killer santa, he just stops talking.there's a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that joe petto makes. we even see him buying a bunch when derek's mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma. and what exactly is this guy doing? well, we're not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick. he does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a "larry the larvae" toy for his kid, but of course "larry" is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course, well, things aren't pretty.anyway, eventually what's going on with joe petto and pino is of course revealed, and as with the old story, pino is not a "real boy". pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from "kenitalia" (a smooth plastic crotch) so that could account for his evil ways. and the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too, and there's even kind of a happy ending of sorts. whee.a step up from part 4, but not much of one. again, brian yuzna is involved, and screaming mad george, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. a few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too, like clint howard and neith hunter, but that doesn't really make any difference. anyway, i now have seeing the whole series out of my system. now if i could get some of it out of my brain. 4 out of 5.

this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original. it's directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame. the acting is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it interesting. thats one thing i like about screaming mad george (make up effects artist for the film), his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get. the movie isn't really all that gory, but there is an extremely nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot (what!?!) mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time, possibly? if you liked the weirdo 4th installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. i liked it better than the matrix! enjoy.

warped take on the pinocchio theme, and set during the christmas season(..after the previous entry abandoned ties to christmas) has booby-trapped toys sent to murder a child(..yet through this, other victims are accidentally harmed in the process)perhaps by a toy maker's "son". screaming mad george was responsible for the killer toys(..including a larvae which enters a victim's mouth and out his eye, another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy, operating from a remote control). the little target is a mute child named derek(william thorne)whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face, causing him to land on a fireplace poker. mother sarah(jane higginson)worries about her son's mental state, figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or, more importantly, talking, derives from watching her husband's horrific murder. derek's real father, noah(tracy fraim)fears for his son't safety, and informs, reluctantly, his ex-girlfriend sarah that the local toymaker, joe petto(mickey rooney)once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash..kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son, then others shouldn't either. still quite a heavy drinker(..often seen swigging jack), petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids, but his creepy son pino(brian bremer)hasn't and derek he harbors angst towards. why? you'll soon understand.pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise. rooney's name adds an allure to the film, gaining it a notoriety, but his histrionics can only help so much. attractive lead actress higginson(slaughterhouse)and fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren't so bad, but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously. i'm guessing that's the point, but rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this..he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation, quite volatile, barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards pino, when not downing liquor. bremer is appropriately weird and "robotic" as pino, longing to have sarah as his mama. the practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing..screaming mad george's work with savage steve holland was far more effective than what we see in this film. the sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe(..i can't even recall any nudity). probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted, but that's not exactly an endorsement. i'm pretty sure written on paper, this was an entertaining concept, the idea of spoofing pinocchio using horror elements, but the result doesn't exactly blow you away.

"cavemen" exceeded my expectations, and not in a good way. it was even worse than i thought it would be. basically, here's the show: the cavemen are an alternate race, they face prejudice, etc. quite possibly the stupidest idea ever created; almost being worthy of jail time for the writers. one show featured the cavemen going into a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. it was reminiscent of listening to a 22 minute andy rooney dialog, followed by death by steak knives via midget cannibals. for those who have not seen this show, here's an example of the dialog: "you're sure you're okay with going out with a caveman." "yeah, that's fine. i've had like 10 - thousand!" hilarious... possibly the best writing i've ever witnessed.22 minutes of cavemen with horrible makeup, tackling tough social issues... sounds like an entertaining night. i also love how bad the recent ideas are that they're resorted to making a sitcom out of car insurance commercials. i wonder if they'll do the gecko next, so that i can have a new title for the worst show i've ever seen. i would even say that this is worse than "viva laughlin." at least "viva laughlin" was ripped off from something that was somewhat inspired.shows like this make me hope that there's a comet up there somewhere aimed for earth.(unratable honestly...)

i wasted my time and gave this show a chance. this has to be one of the worst new shows. if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should sweep the category. the acting is poor and the story line is contrived. now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining. that show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. this new show, based on an insurance companies commercials, is not funny and really has nothing going for it. possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were, and still are, repeated is what is wrong with this show. it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the "caveman" characters.

this is 30 minute show about one joke. the joke, cavemen are not treated fairly. hahaha!!! he can't dial a phone because he is a caveman. cavemen are not as smart as human beings. oh jeez, those cavemen are so unsophisticated. there is no humor in this show. they can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the geico commercials. this show does not deserve a time slot on national t.v. this show tries to hard to be funny, but it just isn't. watching this show, i was thinking that it was trying to be like a "bachelor's gone wild show." meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. the crying caveman is annoying. the caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman(hahaha!!!). all three of them have personalities, but i can't figure out why i don't care about them.

cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching. this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico. the makeup was half ass-ed to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist. this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials, that in it self makes for a lousy show. perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance, instead the pilot lacked a good story line. i give this show a 1 out of 10, i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option. i pray for a quick death to this show, i'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death.

three part "horror" film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why.the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos. it leads up to two totally predictable twists. still, it's quick (about 15 minutes), violent, well-acted and well-done. predictable but enjoyable.the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money. his car breaks down, he's attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. very obvious, badly done and extremely slow. even at 30 minutes this is too long. good acting though.the third is just barely a horror story. it involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for mr. right. it has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene. but (again) predictable and not even remotely scary.it ends very stupidly.all in all, the first one is worth watching, but that's it. tune in for that one then turn it off.

this is the most messed up entry on imdb that i've yet to stumble across. all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie. this is not the movie. rather it's merely a featurette that's an extra on the dvd of the movie "the one" it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it's listed here as. in actuality it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the movie. so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit fubar. don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong. you can trust me, because i never feed you, dear reader, bs.and that's the truth. i guess u can say that i'm "the one" reviewer that matters.

this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. the story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy. i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts.

oh dear, this movie was bad for various reasons. i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over-all score.sorry, but to rate this highly as many have, is a joke! once you get past the one shot/black and white movie gimmick, which was a nice idea, the movie drags on, even at a run time of only 66 minutes. the credits sequence at the start was so annoying too!in the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel, wow, that was needed in the story! how slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound campbell?? they did not seem to bother continue chasing him...sigh..i am only too glad i got this free with a special edition of evil dead!!

nobody, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the divine one, ruth elizabeth davis, and "elizabeth and essex" is a great example why. although she overplays the part at times, watch her when she gawfs about raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies-in-waiting are about to play: in that one moment, she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! at other times, she is done in by the script's sappiness. when elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she comes off as weak and shrewish. this has the added effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice, it's hard to take her seriously.flynn exudes charm, making us see how essex was able to worm his way into elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man. it also doesn't help that essex is badly underwritten. why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue-blooded, thus, more "worthy" of rule? and why does raliegh betray elizabeth by intercepting her and essex's letters? he's in no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where essex (and his head) is headed. so why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable?what did curtiz do with all the $$$ he was given? he doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage. he should've ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and essex) is unnecessary. the costumes are fantastic. and is it me, or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon?

there's not much to say about this one. gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. he is loosed by a nuclear explosion. he heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. i almost forgot). at one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. safe. from then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. for some reason, gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. oh, well, the plot is to try to get gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. as usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a gammera suit). the japanese army (with the help of americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. they should know this anyway. we've seen a lot of monsters stomp on tokyo. not to put these down because they can be fun, but it's really not very good.

this "clever" film was originally a japanese film. and while i assume that original film was pretty bad, it was made a good bit worse when american-international films hacked the film to pieces and inserted american-made segments to fool the audience. now unless your audience is made of total idiots, it becomes painfully obvious that this was done--and done with little finesse or care about the final product. the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different. plus, the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about gamera--the evil flying turtle! and although this is a fire-breathing, flying and destructive monster, there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film--in particular, film veterans brian donlevy and albert dekker. they both just looked tired and ill-at-ease for being there.now as for the monster, it's not quite the standard godzilla-like creature. seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious. on the other hand, the crappy model planes, destructible balsa buildings and power plant are, as usual, in this film and come as no surprise. plus an odd japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non-japanese audience members, and that is the "adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him". yeah, right. well, just like in godzilla versus the smog monster and several other films, you've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster, though unlike later incarnations of godzilla, gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot! silly, exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year-old, bad acting, meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film. oddly, while most will surely hate this film (and that stupid kid), there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa. don't believe them--this is a terrible film!fyi--apparently due to his terrific stage presence, gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations. none of these change the central fact that he is a fire-breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really, really lame.

flame in, flame out. that seems to be gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon. i'm not a fan of japanese monster films, but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci-fi collection put out by mill creek/treeline films. it's a great value at about twenty five bucks, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings.gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast, and he's not happy. like godzilla, he takes it out on tokyo, setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet. they arrive at 'plan z', the hope of the world, and wouldn't you know it, there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the 'z plan' building; that was a nice touch.by the mid 1960's, this country still wasn't quite politically correct. one of the american military scenes at the alaskan air defense sector has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee. i guess there weren't any privates around.good old gammera was quite the sight though, walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged. that's why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, whisking him off to mars to save the world. high fives all around for the american and russian team that made the save, now let's get back to the cold war.like godzilla, gammera spawned at least a good dozen films, but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has "attack of the monsters" with a featured guest appearance by the big g. it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said 'gammera, sayonara!"

we now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine. it's the world of godzilla, rodan, mothra ghidrah and their kind - a strange world, and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called gamera.forever in the shadow of the monolithic toho studios, second rung daiei studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies. in the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to toho's mammothly successful godzilla. they wisely chose gamera as their flagship - a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle-teeth, and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell's feet-holes (and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire!).the first gamera film "gamera the invincible" (as it was sold to the us) is a virtual mirror of the first godzilla film, only 10 years behind. american fighters chase an unmarked plane over the arctic to its fiery demise - the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant gamera from its icy slumber. feeding off atomic energy, it immediately goes on a rampage, and the world wants to destroy gamera once and for all, but a little japanese boy named kenny, who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside, believes gamera is essentially kind and benevolent. he's like a little jewish kid with a pinup of hitler. "gamera is a good turtle," he pleads, then sulks, and puts on a face like someone's pooped in his coco pops. miraculously the world's leaders listen to him, and so begins z-plan to save the world and gamera from complete destruction.released in 1965, gamera was a surprising hit. the annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both japan and the us, and the sight of gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of tokyo and the north pole is gloriously chintzy. most surprising of all is the longevity of the series: eight original gamera films, plus a slew of recent remakes. not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast - and if i hear "gamera is friends to all children" one more time i'm going to crush tokyo. which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle-fest gamera.

with the rising popularity of the now iconic godzilla series, like with any hit cinema event, there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard. with godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju (giant monster) genre. many sought after success; a few gained it. one of the few that not only profited, but garnered popularity was gamera, a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion. but unlike godzilla, gamera was marketed as a friend to all children, later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril, and thus gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies. unfortunately, that's about the only audience mainstream that the original gamera series will have any appeal to. while the new gamera movies directed by shusuke kaneko are marvelous, revolutionary monster movies, the original series, including the original, is nothing special.the first gamera movie, titled in japan as "the giant monster gamera" was clearly a godzilla want-to-be. even though the movie was produced in the era of color films, it was shot in black-and-white. why? to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s. gamera also attacks tokyo. because godzilla attacked tokyo in the first movie. i don't know much about the japanese version, for the version i am familiar with the americanized version, where scenes were cut and new footage with american actors were inserted (is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first godzilla film?) now whether this adds or takes away from the film, i cannot say. but "gammera the invincible" is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself."gammera the invincible" is a very routine-orientated movie. the characters are from a stock of science-fiction standards, the story is inane, the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization, the acting is laughable, and so on and so forth. the only thing that differentiates it from the godzilla series is the ending of the movie, but that's also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts gamera's rampage is completely phony and ridiculous. now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description, but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.and although shusuke kaneko would later transform gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s, in the original series, gamera was not an attractive screen presence. he was neither scary nor sympathetic. he just waddles around like a toddler, swaying with each step, and knocks miniature sets over. as usual, everybody wants to destroy gamera except for a little kid (yoshio uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a 'central' role) who thinks gamera is a nice turtle.most movies in the genre that "gammera the invincible" is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure. even in the company of many other godzilla-imitators, this gamera film is not a particularly good entry. and as far as my cinema experience goes, the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse. like godzilla, gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters. and like godzilla, he'd get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again.it's peculiar. usually i recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes. but in the case of gamera, my verdict is just the opposite. i strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s gamera trilogy directed by shusuke kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested. the new films are inventive, well-made, exciting, and above all, fun. the original series is a long stream of boredom.

"after the atomic bombs carried by a shot-down soviet bomber explode in the arctic, the creature 'gammera' is released from his hibernation. the giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to tokyo and destroys anything in his path. the military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before tokyo is laid to waste," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. the re-produced for american audiences version of this, the first film in the "gamera" series, adds english language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed japanese fare. clearly, the monster is following in the footsteps of "godzilla". taking his cue from abc's faddish "batman!" tv series, musician wes farrell's ludicrous theme song heightens the us version's camp appeal.*** gammera the invincible (12/15/66) sandy howard, noriaki yuasa ~ dick o'neill, brian donlevy, albert dekker, john baragrey

what's that there in the skies? is it a plane? is it superman?? errr, no it's a turtle!?! see, that's what becomes of the cold war! nothing but bad news and other issues! the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts & literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle-creature named gammera. he/she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path. the arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice-bomb, but gammera has another surprise in store the damn turtle can fly! the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence! gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air. how can you not love that? then there's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who's able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but that's just not interesting enough. flying turtle, people!! there's very little else to write about this japanese (and american re-edited) sci-fi effort, apart from that it's an obvious and totally shameless rip-off of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from 20.000 fathoms. the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and, unlike the aforementioned films, it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance. respectable actors like brian donlevy ("the quatermass experiment") and dick o'neill ("wolfen") seem unaware of what film set they're on and even the original japanese mayhem-scenes aren't very convincing. gammera's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool, though, so it gets one extra point for that.

the original 1965 japanese film "gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented gojira (godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. this version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious sandy frank. and just like the americanized version of godzilla ("godzilla king of the monsters"), "gammera the invincible" gets more than just the spelling wrong. the american scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. the film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. once gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film.the acting is good enough- even the american add-ons are ok. the directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. the biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.

this movie was in a sci-fi 50-pack a friend of mine got me for christmas. it is very similar to the first gozilla movie, and like that movie, has scenes with american actors inserted for no real reason. one interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a cold war tension portrayed between america and russia. like in godzilla, gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages across the world, paying close attention to tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless tokyo bites it. all in all, this is an okay movie. some of the scenes involving gamera, particularly the scenes in toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. if you like japanese giant monster movies, you'll really get a kick out of this one. i give it a 4 out of 10. had this been the unedited japanese version that i watched, it probably would've gotten a 5.

murders are occurring in a texas desert town. who is responsible? slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions (the latter really doesn't fit), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans, who will appreciate the gore and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films.dana kimmell (of friday the 13th part 3 infamy) stars as the bratty quasi-detective teen.*1/2 out of ****mpaa: rated r for violence and gore, nudity, and some language.

i am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few reviews that there are to be positive. i saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed. i didn't find it very enjoyable at all. it was slow, and lacks the entertainment value. even the murder scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don't look good at all. and the supposed great twist ending is really not much, i did see it coming, and then the ending just seemed cliche. this movie may not get much mention, but by the little that it does get, it is overrated. i would not recommend this movie.

melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. it's up to the local town sheriff dan burke (bo hopkins, the wild bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, marci (dana kimmell, friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's slasher brethren. it doesn't hurt that alesia has a great body (i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). on the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. but the good outweigh the bad (barely). give this a rent, but i wouldn't buy it.eye candy: aleisa shirley shows her tits, bush and ass my grade: c code red dvd extras: an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder, scott spiegel; both director's cut & theatrical version of the film; audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos; interview with shirley, sotos & bo hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for nightmare, stunt rock, rituals, & balalaika conspiracy

sweet sixteen (1983) **/***** 86 minutes director jim sotos cast bo hopkins, susan strasberg, aleisa shirley, patrick macnee, dana kimmellfifteen year old bad girl melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. the detective has to put together the clues with the help of his nancy drew good girl daughter played by friday the 13th alumni dana kimmell. the local native americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. these events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at melissa's sixteenth birthday party.this below average slasher isn't too memorable. it has a made for tv feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. lines like "the killer will turn us into coleslaw." fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. marci calls melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. apparently marci sees how hard it is to fit in because melissa knows how to wear make-up. this movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. the social commentary on indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. both sweet sixteen and ed hunt's bloody birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but i feel failed to deliver. but on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on dvd gives hope that others will follow.

plot = melissa is a new girl in town, she's fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week. since melissa is beautiful, every boy in town wants to hook up with her, but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die.to be honest the real reason i wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn't a proper reason why to rush out and see a movie. when i started watching it i realized that "sweet sixteen" isn't a very good slasher, it's really dull and boring and just doesn't go anywhere. after over an hour, only three murders have occurred and the story hasn't really developed in any possible way.the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s, the movie suffers from being too dark at times. the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even though she's a complete slut.the story line isn't completely rubbish but it's just way too dull to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie.all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn't go anywhere i'd definitely wouldn't recommend it to slasher fans.

did anybody succeed in getting in this movie?it's a total mess to me: a vague historical/sentimental context instead of a plot, a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours!shame on those who wasted money here.

rex reed once said of a movie ("julia and julia" to be specific) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice. i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly. this one appeared to be shot through gauze.the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time. also, everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters. i call this the "dead poets society" syndrome.there was nobody to care about, nobody to become interested in dramatically, and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.a total disappointment.

i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever. perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you're spot on.complicated story-line? hardly. try juvenile and amateurish. exquisite moods and haunting memories? hardly. try flat-out boring and trite.this was awful. i could not wait for it to be over. particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of "how are you? i'm fine. are you sure? yes." wow! what depth of character. i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.as a huge fan of many chinese, japanese and korean films, i was totally disappointed in this. even zhang's sentimentally sappy "the road home" was better than this.

ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai. ding hui (zhang ziyi) and her ex-lover hidehiko itami (toru nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.i agree with the reviewer from paris. the film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. normally i don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film "has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography", but i don't think that helps the movie. the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film. the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.the actors are all suitably melancholy. zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. however, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator.all in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he. 2/10

the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who. no racism intended, but these asians look all the same! i can tell somewhat of the story, but heck thats about as far as it goes. the peoples identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery i would care about them. instead i wasn't them off the screen asap.tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie. heck is it boring, not only do i not know these people, but they are just sitting there.the production is typical chinese john woo, terrible video with blotched scenes. this looks only slightly better than andy lau's "fulltime killer" (which was a great movie.) you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s hollywood. i didn't know the chinese had these art-house beatniks.

i am a huge ziyi zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to purple butterfly. as much as i wanted to like this movie, i have to agree with many others who have commented on it. it is very confusing and also extremely slow. because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. the film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much. there are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. the way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow. even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about, i still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. i knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous ziyi zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately i was ultimately disappointed. she never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about. i could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find.

i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times. in addition, i'm also shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter. however, after watching it, i was extremely disappointed.the movie's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous. the director lingered on certain scenes for much too long. there was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. there was barely any dialogue. dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting. at the end of the movie, you didn't feel any compassion for the characters. this movie was lacking in everything. the script was weak, the acting was poor, and the editing was non-existent. the director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably. a good movie is one in which captures your attention, maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by. this movie felt as though it would never end. don't waste your money on this movie.

claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: too long face only shots where you most of the time get the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing (that the screen is cut off), because there seems to be important actions going on, but you cannot see them. there is anyway already too much confusion in the movie, so these viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to artful visuals. i like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work. i can handle deep and slow movies. but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.nothing to get attached to, to any of the characters, because they are not worked out well enough. to work out characters more is needed, than just minute long face shots, at least with this set of script+director+actors.i wonder whether some of the not so good acting is due to the script and director or due to the actors. i will stay away from films both written and directed by le you for sure in the future. what an annoying film even for someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who spent time in shanghai.

lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 china, just prior to the japanese invasion of manchuria, and reunites with a former lover who is now working for japan. every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director ye lou's somnambulist directorial style. characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, hand-held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to, edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak, who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy. a very sleep inducing film.

i wasn't really going to comment, but then i figured i had something to say. i saw this film two days ago and, although i think it's not a complete waste of time (it might have been of money though, for the producers), it's obvious it has serious problems. it's got really good cinematography and (little but) nice music. a lot has been said about ana cristina oliveira but, let's be honest, over what? she is not really an actress an she balances permanently between over-acting and preposterous under-acting. her performance passes for good because there has never been anyone like odete in any other film: crazy? sad? childlike? an impostor? no one knows, fellows. so she's kinda sorta dictating the rules here.i thought this film was also a good example of the problem most portuguese films suffer from: soundtrack. there is a permanent no to dubbing and the result is this usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue. people in other countries may think portugal is the noisiest of places. what thrilled me though, was that some of the dialog was dubbed but it didn't necessarily solve the syndrome. bad dubbing too, i must say. it's strange to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind on the first scene, when the first character speaks is: it's dubbed. and all this to say that the film has technical problems.it also has script problems. it tries to be classical from the first to the last scene. there was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and that shows. the writer was obviously trying to get everything straight and he does but... it shows!! all dialog is too expositive and there isn't one single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a film. it's all a little raw and slightly unpleasant.not that the film is a total mess, i must stress. i just think the good parts are so obvious that i prefer to concentrate on the bad ones.direction brings little to the weak screenplay. all shots are classical and un-innovative, but their beautiful. great work from rui poças, by the way.now, what i think was the problem, the one that keeps people from believing this story and laugh throughout the film instead of taking it seriously: the guy who plays the guy who dies is obviously not an actor. actually, it's a rather important role and i can't see why non-actors are cast for such parts. this guy is neither an actor nor a good-looking man. which means the whole film rolls down the mountain, since we never believe for one second that this gorgeous woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone, and that his hunky lover who survives is actually having a bad time getting over the loss, when all we see of this character is apathy. too bad. the world is full of beautiful people who even happen to be nice seductive lovers. the world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsessions on people after they's gone. the world is full of great films and also of not that great films. c'est la vie!

i tried. i really did. i thought that maybe, if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance, i could enjoy his movie. i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core, but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor, so i was like, "what the hell. at least you didn't pay 10 dollars at the quad. give it a shot."sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain. i often wonder if it wouldn't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it. on other occasions, i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough, i will not only get away from it all, but fall clear over, and that some evil, lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995, still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of me.is there a reason for odete? i'd say not at all... just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness (one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake) look not only creepy, but flat-out sick to the bone. she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend (in shrieking hysterics) because she wants a child and he believes they're too young. she later crashes a funeral of a gay man, and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him, she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man's mother and lover in the sickest of ways. oh, of course, she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one, but a good three times on his grave. and there's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes "pedro" which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender. or something.i'd say she's as nuts as a can of cashews, unsalted. but then again, so's the director. and me, for taking a chance on this. at least the men look good. other than that... not much else to see here.

a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn't on (it's not like the writers/producers could do anything about that). the writing was poor, the script was sub-par. what really annoyed us: 1. when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie, they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted natalie. 2. despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, it's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film). 3. blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.

the animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic. after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with. with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies. if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it, but frankly, i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell. go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll get way more out of it.

the last station, director michael hoffman's melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy, begins with fog and sleep. tolstoy (christopher plummer) lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana, taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his "movement", people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism, vegetarianism, sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away. his wife, sophia (helen mirren) wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov (paul giamatti), who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death. observing all of this is tolstoy's new steward, bulgakov (james mcavoy), a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.hoffman's script, which is based on the novel by jay parini, quite often veers itself into confused territory, building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way. the scope of the film is grand, and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy, whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like ghandi. it unfortunately doesn't, it's un-unpickable, building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness. the three-way relationship between the church, the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy, for example, is referenced often. in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up, but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy. there are a ton of details in the film, but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered, overburdened, energetic but unfortunately pointless.at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy, and that story, as baffling and cramped as it is, is the reason to watch the film. mirren and plummer are, unsurprisingly, the best things in the film. plummer's tolstoy is vague, at once confused and resolute, apprehensive and full of joy and certainty. mirren's sophia is in full panic, in a righteous lather, forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time, his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas. they're great performances, all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that, both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone, both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there. giammati and mcavoy, both talented actors, are unable to do the same and giamatti's chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief (and not both at once, either) but rather a cipher, a stand-in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses. the scope of this thing never boils down to anything, it hitches along, getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else. it's interesting and pretty, but ultimately unrewarding. 4.5/10

it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see "the medusa touch" should be warned about a scene that's eerily reminiscent of the sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in nyc. but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. despite an interesting pedigree (producer elliott kastner produced "harper" and "the long goodbye"; co-producer arnon milchan co-produced the oscar-nominated "l.a. confidential" and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for "gandhi") and an international cast, i found "the medusa touch" to be a heavy-handed, unintentional laugh riot. it was a poorly directed, horribly written and acted mess. it tried to capitalize on the 70s telekinetic thrillers genre. the movie fails on many counts. please consider "carrie" and the underrated "the fury" (both directed by brian depalma). they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter.

if 1977's "exorcist ii: the heretic" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills. you've seen it all before: burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind (and you thought "carrie" had no impact on hollywood!). though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway, "medusa" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid (if typical). lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak. burton is hammy but weary...not even telekinesis could save him at this point. *1/2 from ****

what a great actor to have in such an awful story...the film and its production, however, is quite good, even though set in london but with exteriors in bristol. no matter  see one cathedral, you've seen 'em all, sort of.the story however...is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything, should he so wish. with just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; so much so, in fact, that he exacts vengeance at will, literally. over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it!the trouble with the narrative, however, is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi-religious claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory about it all. mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and i'm afraid richard burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing. his very best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home: sharp, witty and deadly dialog, delivered as only burton could.a good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better, though, beginning with lino ventura, whom i last saw in garde a vu (1981), as inspector brunel; harry andrews as assistant commissioner; the much under-rated lee remick as dr zonfeld; derek jacobi as a publisher, towney, and a few other well known character actors.i liked the way the story was presented, as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of morlar (richard burton), the writer with the killer disposition. up till that point, it was a good piece of visual detective work by brunel and his english sidekick. still, it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would-be murderer.then, they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes. if you want a clue about what that is, think samson and delilah (1949), from the illustrious cecil b. de mille, and how samson got the bad guys in the end. and, the very last scene is just plain stupid. why? because there are at least a hundred ways that morlar's rampaging could have been stopped, absolutely.shame, actually, because this could have been a lot better story and movie. i guess burton really needed the money.if you're burton fan, then spend the time to see that scene i mentioned above. otherwise, don't bother.

this is a review of the wizard, not to be confused with the wiz, or mr. wizard. the wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz, and mr. wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. it's simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove, the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3. i use the word "designed" in the loosest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos.i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. it sure hasn't been for me. in fact, i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. next time you're at the video store and you see the the wiz, the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead.

was there a single positive to this film? critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made. no damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example.and i may have missed something, but wasn't super mario bros. 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before? well if that is the case, and i did not miss anything... how did fred savage's character, and even the girl, know so much about the game already? we're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play-through.beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself. nothing here is honestly very memorable. the kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. a lot of kids i knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced. on top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. the characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the 'wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma. it isn't that this is unrealistic, it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. if you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not. it was about kids playing video games, and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the nes as well. but unless you loved it as a kid there just isn't anything that's going to keep you interested, and very little that will prevent you from turning it off.no sir, i didn't like it.

it's very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies. they get worse every time. niki and flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. it's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g. chicago international film festival). this movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money. score: 0.02 out of 10.

i find it rather useless to comment on this "movie" for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it. but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian "movie" directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called "romanian reality" following the communist era (1990 to present days).under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others (who lately find amateurish camera, lack of plot, lack of directorial / actors's quality etc, noise etc. as being trendy and even art-like) : watch & enjoy this "movie" (as i know you will) but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor, don't write an online review for it will misguide, irritate and in the end waste their time.on the other hand this movie (among others) has some value whatsoever, an educational one for it sets the example for : "how not to make a movie."

i saw this movie twice. i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie. i'm also a movie/theatre director and i know what i speak. this is not romania anymore, but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september. no story, no plot, nothing. no conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. just empty images.what most of romanians don't know, this movie is for the french viewers, not for us. they really believe that is the reality in romania. also for teenagers. pintilie should stop making movies. i don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe. this was a reality, but isn't anymore. a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said: "you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu".

this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.

i was excited to view a cataluña´s film in the berlin´s competition. but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious. too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. the spanish civil war, like every war, was horrible. the revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism . but what mr villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie. i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.

ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way through.this film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. the story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. a tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'god' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. it uses the irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it. aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'oirish' accent. all in all why do they pump these out.

first let me be honest. i did not watch all this movie. i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... it didn't. this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. this film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.

ha. without a doubt tommy's the evil one here. i don't know why, but for some reason, little kids in horror movies tend to come across as little butt munches. and since they're kids, they won't die. because they're annoying...well..except for asylum of terror. but those are few and far between.anyway onto the movie. can't find this movie on dvd? sure you can! all you have to do is buy the chilling classics dvd pack! not only do you get metamorphosis on dvd for $15, but you also get 49 other movies! what a bargain! pff. ok. i'm done advertising for these cheesy movies. let's just say, this movie ain't worth the 15 bucks on its own.so we have a chemist scientist. yeah. cause all chemist scientists look as handsome as this guy playing peter. he's trying to come up with a serum to stop deterioration of the body. the college he works at wants to pull the plug on his project, so he tries it on himself. but because this is a horror movie, he sucks it up and starts and incredibly long transformation sequence that takes nearly 3/4 of the movie.to pad out the movie he gets into a relationship with some woman who has a son. and she was never married! scandalous! but of course tommy is one of the most irritating characters....no. i take it back. he is the most irritating character. far worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over peter's work and gloats over him while he's in the hospital. that's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the villain.so we see peter start to randomly kill some people in visions he has until he realizes he's the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone in his path to get back to normal. however at the end he ends up de-evolving into a lizard. yeah, i know don't ask. the ending really doesn't make any sense. and if you're hoping for any really good payoff, you're not going to get it.this isn't a horrible movie....it's just frustrating because of the lack of a good payoff. if you already own the 50 movie pack and this is next on your list, you're not in for a snoozer, but you're also not in for a great movie. just sit back, relax, and eat a lot of snack food. because this movie isn't going to be making you jump out of your skin anytime soon.metamorphosis gets 4 plastic lizard heads, out of 10.

i unknowingly had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection, and one night i just decided to watch it; though not expecting much. as the beginning credits roll around i'm surprised to discover this film was made under the filmirage company. filmirage brought the world such amazing stinkers as "troll 2", "ator the invincible", and "quest for the mighty sword", so i was compelled to watch.as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent, even though it was unoriginal. the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. but after a while into the film, the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking "okay someone better get killed soon",or "someone better mutate". at the onset of this drag, when i was having these thoughts, though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated, however as noted, the gore and effects weren't very good. what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; example: first dr. houseman would be at the zoo, then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone, finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed-- making the audience ask "was he dreaming he was at the zoo?". like the movie's pace, these scene transitions got progressively worse.i could try to say the character development of dr. houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the film, that is, once you've seen what the doctor has metamorphosed into, hopefully you'll laugh-- which really, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; this movie unintentionally runs like a long-winded joke.the costume of the um, thing that doctor houseman becomes can also be seen in joe d' amato's "quest for the mighty sword", which was made in the same year. you've gotta love filmirage movies, they're always re-using the same stuff!

as others have mentioned, this movie is similar to the fly (both versions) and the lesser known sci-fi flick altered states. the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it. metamorphosis did not have these advantages. metamorphosis is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles.the story follows scientist dr. peter houseman (gene lebrock), an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death. when the university he works for threatens to cut funding, he decides to inject the anti-aging serum into himself. as a result, dr. houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard. and oh yes, watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy. it really is so bad that it's good. some of the lines are classic: "what was it?" "a nightmare...from the past!"many of the reviews that i've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are. i'm just going to go ahead and spoil it: the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half-man, half-lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected godzilla costume, when the police finally gun him down. in the final scene, some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die, and the movie's heroine, sally donnelly (catherine baranov) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of dr. houseman. the camera then gives us a close-up of the lizard's face; this is, i assume, the director's way of showing us that the lizard is evil. yes, it is goofy, but i fell over laughing so i can't complain.i watched this movie because it was a part of the chilling classics 50 movie megapack that i purchased. i'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing, as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on dvd. if you have recently bought the boxed set and haven't watched this movie yet, it really is worth your time, even if i did just ruin the ending for you. it might also be possible to find this movie online for free.

metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics 50 movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set. released in 1990, metamorphosis seems to be a remake of "the atom age vampire," which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. set in modern times, metamorphsis is not my kind of horror movie.a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. pressured by the administration to publish his papers; and, produce some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects, he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! the acting is stilted; and, the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. the score is pandering. and, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous  at best. as others noted, the end turns into a 30+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless. without giving too much away, i'd call this one, "dr. jekyll and mr. hyde meet the creature from the black lagoon meets home alone."

it's the same old, "if i can't get the funding for my project, i'll inject myself" monster movie. there is nothing new here. it's a lot like the jeff goldblum "fly" movie. the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. the acting is pretty bad. there are people acting stupidly all along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter. then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son. admittedly, he is good looking, but he seems like a lot of trouble. it's just a pretty big waste of time. even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention.

'metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college. this forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad-hollywood melodramatic fashion.my first thought after this movies conclusion was this. "not good, but not bad, for early-to-mid eighties." of course, i then realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it down to a '4', but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is.'metamorphis' does on a few occasions, seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out. the acting, while not stellar, is mostly competent. you can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality. pacing is a large problem with the movie. after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes, i realized i'd only been watching an hour. special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.the lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of tom cruise and christopher reeves, reminded me mostly of matt dillon's character in 'wild things'. the female heroine does an ok job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. there's a 'naughty girl' role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't seem like much. there is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose, cheerful or just weird. pacing, as i said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger blush. it is bizarre and inexplicable, until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds.a decent one-time watch on the 'mill creek 50 chilling movie pack'. nothing that is going to bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own.

meet peter houseman, rock star genetic professor at virgina university. when he's not ballin' on the court he's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures. dr. houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal. i'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer. an assortment of old and ugly university professors don't care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results. this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum. much to my amazement there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphoses! into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for "millions of years". he also beds dr. mike's crush sally after a whole day of knowing her. she has a son. his name is tommy. he is an angry little boy.metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie, just not a well produced one. the whole time i watched this i couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest. it does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics. there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever. the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually, for me at least, save the movie from a lower rating. pay attention to the computer terminology such as "cromosonic anomaly". no wonder peter's experiment failed. your computer can't spell! this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.

all the elements for a bad night at the movies are in place: dialog riddled with biological techno-babble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood acting, a horrific late-'80s casio score, and an overall look that suggests anything on the sci-fi channel's programming schedule, circa 1993. though "metamorphosis" starts off with a lot of promise, the film unravels into bland idiocy and mst3k-style cheese as clark kent wannabe 'doctor' peter houseman (gene lebrock) is pressured into releasing information on his secretive projects. but when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he transforms into a vaguely-defined creature (that bears more than a passing resemblance to 'dr. freudstein' from "house by the cemetery"). the fx work is fairly good for such an obviously low-budget production (though i suspect most of it is kept in shadow for a reason), but overall, "metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your guts, in spite of its hopes to sway us otherwise. i can't help but agree with one character's closing remark: "(it was) a nightmare...from the past!"

"metamorphosis" hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by george eastman. this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d'amato production during the late 70's/early 80's. wouldn't it be interesting for avid euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in "erotic nights of the living dead" all the time? i thought so! now, unlike the movies he starred in, eastman's own "metamorphosis" is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. there are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen laura gemser!) on display, but it's mainly a talkative movie. the handsome & eloquent dr. houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. so dr. houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! in other words, his research sucked! like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie "borrows" a lot of ideas from david cronenberg's "the fly"  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesn't add any originality from its own. the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblum's character in "the fly", whereas dr. houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. the rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodato's sadly underrated giallo "phantom of death", only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself. the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films, though. few scares or excitement to discover here, instead the movie features loads of bad acting, poor lighting, lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. feel free to skip this one.

a young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. he's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published, so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (i think).he does a trial injection on a monkey, which quickly dies. he then tries it on himself. he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research.initially, he seems to have no effects from the injection, except some new strength. he then realizes that he had some memory loss, and starts recalling what happened. additionally, he starts to appear very unhealthy.since the movie is named metamorphosis, he does eventually change into something else. you won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into, or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. incredibly, there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd.about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it, but she has a very small part.i'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time, perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic, which had been removed. the novelty boxcover, if it still had it, would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie; i'm definitely getting rid of it.

hello i am from denmark, and one day i was having a film evening with my friends. one brought this movie with him "russian terminator" and it was extremely awful. after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable "highlights" or should i say "lowlights" in the movie. i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland denmark...that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made.

this is really a very bad movie. why? first of all, the story is bad. it is an artificial story, combining all sorts of things together that make no sense. it just seems a wrong experiment. secondly, the actors cannot play in a realistic manner. they cannot even talk as an actor should. why did i buy this movie? and what must i do with it now?

shamefull as it may be, this movie actually made it to the videomarket, bringing shame on my proud country - any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing, will be a fruitless attempt. one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this, then having either fallen asleep, or visited the bathroom for puking.note: if you haven't seen anything else from denmark, please remember this:some things were never meant to be - but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway!

i'm studying catalan, and was delighted to find el mar, a movie with mostly catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (for the most part, that is... would the mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) oh, well... minor detail. up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical pan's labyrinth, also set in the spanish civil war.fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, manuel and ramallo, both are patients. i know, but hey, coincidences happen.the problem, as with so many spanish movies (apologies to almodovar fans), is that with one exception (francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.what's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood. the reviewer who called it a "potboiler" is quite on track. if it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: see forbidden love!! rape!! murder!! mutilation!! fanaticism!! animal cruelty!! betrayal!! the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. to work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. as it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between "brother sun, sister moon" and "pulp fiction." if that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. i think i go with something that doesn't make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.as for the catalan, it's the mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the barcelona dialect, though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it.

throw this lame dog a bone. sooo bad...you may watch anyway. kol(ross hagen)is an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship commander(jan-michael vincent). kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on earth. an unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive. john phillip law plays a forest/park ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far, far away. costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence. vincent surely took the money and ran. law shows the only sign of effort.so bad it is almost comical. also in the cast: dyana ortelli, p.j. soles and dawn wildsmith.

for the initial 20 minutes or so (i was watching it on a ps2 so i've really no idea how long it took) alienator sets up an interesting premise. i don't think i've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before. however, interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the 'alien' is a huge body-builder woman in a steel bikini. yes, alienator is patently ridiculous.don't think i hold that against it. in the world of shlock-horror, patently ridiculous can often be a good sign. however, the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it. alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness, potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set-pieces. by the time the movie's finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it.add to this the fact that the 'alien' just kills people by vaporising them, as opposed to doing any 'slashing' as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot. you'll laugh at alienator, but at it, not with it. if that's your thing then go ahead and check it out.

well, i had to be generous and give this a 2. this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that lady's shirt where her breasts are. i found that mildly amusing. other than that, this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend. funny if you're willing to throw "mystery science theatre" comments at it with someone, but it ain't no better than a 2. and a 2 pretty much sucks.

recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf, has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear) and takes time out to pet a deer. then you got the unlikable characters, 30 year old college students, a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots, lots more. avoid at all costs.

having just watched this movie, i almost feel like having wasted 2 hours of my life, but i guess there is some good in everything:if i was to rate this as any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 tops, but if i grade it like a low budget ind. movie, it may get 3 or 4. that is a movie is supposed to be 'complete' and without too long passages of boredom or waste of time. this movie isn't. but i guess a lot of independent movies are about showing movie skills, and considering this, this movie has a few highlights. if i am to comment on what the directors should take with them to their next project, i guess the distorted sound effects had some quality. they also manage to build some characters, this however takes me to what they should leave out in their next project, because the character building takes too long, since it is mostly irrelevant for the movie plot. neither should the long spaces of time dedicated to walking around be continued in the next project - whats the point? i guess this movie tries to be a little bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not a lot)this movie tries too much and too hard, and i guess it should have been cut to a short film. i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue to cut from the movie.there is too much irrelevant things going on in this movie. the story should have been more streamlined. i know there is supposed to be some mystery in this movie, but a slight surprise to who the killer is, doesn't make a mystery. the story behind the "mystery" receives almost no attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a quick an unsatisfying wrap-up. therefore i would like to say this movie was a nice try, but i cant. i hope the directors learn from their mistakes, and produce a better product next time.if you don't have an interest in bench learning from producing low budget movies, there is no need to watch this - not even too see why everyone thinks its bad.as others have stated i am pretty sure the many 10's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. this movie could not receive a "10" judging from any remotely objective standpoint.

the choke (aka axe in the uk) is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight-to-dvd movie. i say "supposedly" because the title of the movie does not have the "v" in brackets to indicate that it was a made for dvd movie (even though it does have the appearance of one).the plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one.i think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece, but this does not excuse the faults here. even straight-to-dvd movies such as bachelor party massacre (which has a very low imdb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called "so bad, they're good" movies. however, the choke falls far short of being either a serious slasher (such as halloween) or being a "so bad it's good" movie (such as the nail gun massacre).the movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill. the blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget. but, from there onwards, it's downhill all the way.there are so many faults in the choke that i could spend all day talking about them. but, a few obvious ones stand out and i'll go into them.the aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops, there seems to be only around 8 people left (and yet they're all meant to be locked in!).the characters in this movie are not likable at all. most of the band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just downright weird. no one really cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been dispatched. the highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). he spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason. but sadly, even his presence can't save the movie.there are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation. around 65 minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking. characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. as in other straight-to-dvd movies such as crocodile and grim weekend, the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all. there are plenty of over-the-top outbursts (mainly from the male characters) and one nearly results in a full-blown fight. in fact, the format could be said to go as follows: characters walk around--murder takes place--characters walk around--murder takes place. you get the idea.the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used. perhaps this was meant to be funny, but it just comes off as sad. and more to the point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually to much greater effect).the movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all. the dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. a maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons. they make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves. and much of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared.in the same vein as drive-in massacre, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). a random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. there is no one seen stalking the characters at any time. in drive-in massacre, this served to make the film funny (unintentionally of course), but here it is not funny at all.and, as another reviewer has pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it. the score (at the end, there is no music at the beginning!) consists of a band of sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie.don't misunderstand the points made in this review. this reviewer likes bad movies (such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor party massacre) as much as the classics (such as halloween and friday the 13th). but, it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either. and even as straight-to-dvd movies go, this is a poor effort.on a positive note, the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes. but, when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion.fans of the traditional 1980s b-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. and fans of the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it!

the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'club 905' owned & run by guy johnson (andrew parker). lead singer dylan (sean cook) & guitar player mike (jason mckee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player london (brooke bailey) & drummer nancy (tom olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer. once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one...produced & directed by juan a. mas the choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. the script by jessica dolan & susannah lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though i don't want to boast i was spot on. then there's the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious. the kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor.director mas does alright, the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. the gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. it's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad.with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently. the acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, i mean no-one is going to win an oscar but it ain't half bad.the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies. i mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point? those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for, right?

i watched this film not really expecting much, i got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect? and you know what i was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (i had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, i thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer, i'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, i've certainly seen a lot worse, but i've also seen a lot better. best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.

released on dvd in the uk as axe, the choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (who are quite obviously destined to be the film's survivors), everyone is thoroughly objectionable, meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered; the deaths aren't gory enough (unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach); and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity (an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick!).the wafer-thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world's largest nightclub (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club i've ever seen) where they are picked off by an unseen assailant. for a low budget effort, the production values are okay, and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors, but with not nearly enough genuine scares, a reluctance to get really messy (this is a slasher, so where's the graphic splatter?), way too much dreadful dialogue (particularly from the not-dead-soon-enough drummer) and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the movie quickly becomes extremely boring.

at the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50% of imdb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1. i can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members. they say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters, those monkeys, just by random proddings at the keyboard, would eventually type out the complete works of shakespeare. however, i seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time, you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10.i patiently watched the first half, foolishly assuming that the film would, on some level, develop either the plot or the characters, or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought. failing that, i was quite prepared to accept action, suspense, comedy, horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention. ultimately, i was disappointed and consequently, much of the second half was viewed at double speed as i searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption. sadly, there was none.if "the choke", was put up against an episode of scooby doo then i'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. and speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor with brooke bailey's portrayal of the freaky, death obsessed pseudo goth, london, being so bad i almost felt sorry for her.i would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack, a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock, failed even to entertain, let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick.

the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. ooooof! her loins rival those of nina hartley. this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the '80s. kurt russell must have had a fun life.

there are only two movies i would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and "the man who fell to earth." i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school. the script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student's) intelligence. it completely lost me with the "hillarious" gag of someone getting shot in the butt. goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs, followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. the acting was terrible, including goldie hawn's. i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you. this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. the worst.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer. the acting in "jill the ripper" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes. it doesn't know whether it wants to be an s&m flick or a really bad thriller. only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. this script should be reworked into a porn, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. a porn, even a bad porn, wouldn't do the damage to dolf lundgren's career the way that this movie has.

it just seems to run true to form, any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad! i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes, or that dolph is such a bad actor. no spoiler here, he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie. in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre.

i saw this film under the title of "tied up". in general i have enjoyed dolph's movies, so gave this one a try. it wasn't worth it. i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers. don't be fooled. this is a poor film at best. the acting is nonexistent. the plot, what little there is of one, is very predictable. the movie in places seems to be chopped together. this one just plain stinks the place up. not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. as a bit of a dolph fan, i kept waiting to see him in action. by the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. best to avoid this film, and spend your time watching almost anything else.

this unpleasant film has little to recommend it. dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed. and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.but no. motivations are either murky or trite. most of the acting is sub-par. the script creates needless confusion. and the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.it's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.

dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe. he is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess of b-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, s&m) that looks like it was made up as they went along. the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick, rent red scorpion instead.

probably the worst dolph film ever. there's nothing you'd want or expect here. don't waste your time. dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life. his brother gets killed and dolph tries to figure things out. the character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly. pointless.

i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger, stallone, and even van damme to certain degree. he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. the strange thing about jill the ripper (or jill rips...or tied up) is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb, on the dvd case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. to call it campy would be a huge understatement. the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. on top of that they put lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? just the plot and premise immediately make it a b-movie porn at very best.dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered. i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren. danielle brett is lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain.i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. to explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the dvd i picked up (it was really cheap) has lundgren's character listed as "murray wilson" (not the name of his character in the film.) while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b-movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious. hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10

dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex, after his brother is murdered, wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother's secrets in this very dull thriller. lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic. also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action?

okay, i rented this movie because of the director...he has made some interesting flicks in the past (if you haven't seen waxork you are missing a fun ride). anyway, i had my doubts about this movie from the beginning but i decided to suck it up and give it a look. it's bad. very bad. if you haven't seen the movie and don't mind spoilers read ahead. first of all, the old saying 'you can't judge a book by it's cover' applies here. the box for this flick seems to indicate that jill is the stone fox with long hair with highlights. the back of the box has a cool shot of the red-leather jill and some other shots. the description makes you want to rent the movie because it sounds good. you start watching it and suddenly you find out that the movie takes place (inexplicably) in 1977. jill is a total dog who is not the girl on the cover. the movie is not quite as predictable as you would think...and that's not a good thing. characters do so many stupid things without any modicum of motivation...it's embarrassing to watch. 10 minutes before the end of the movie dolph and another lady have sex for no good reason. also, what was the point of having dolph kill this other lady in cold blood who had been helping him. anthony hickox the director should have seen a stinker when he read the script. had it been set in the underworld of the new milennium and made the characters halfway intelligent it might have been decent. to set it in the 70's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever. avoid it!

dolph lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother,who was well thought of in the community, however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. dolph lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact on the basis of his performance here, one would forget lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with, in fact, lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. co-star danielle brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett, indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. however the movie is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot not given enough exploration (too much boring b.s around lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. once again, lundgren is actually really good (as is newcomer danielle brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing. if anything else though, it shows how underrated lundgren is, as an actor.*1/2 out of 4-(poor)

i've tried to like this film, really. in watching it, all i can think is, "this guy gives me the creeps, i would have gotten a restraining order". it also calls out codependence in capital letters. was this really the conversation before making the movie? "let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. the mood of the movie is distinctly 80-ish; brooding and slow. don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, just very few of them.

outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest. only hawn's well-known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice. goldie's gotta be a contender for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal...

the director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an "experiental" film. experimental? leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. a meandering pastiche road show manqué that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater. i would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. tepid applause. pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product. avoid this film!

the only reason "the norliss tapes" deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast. other than getting to see angie baby in a pre-"police woman" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing here.the synopsis:*** minor spoilers ***david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the "norliss tapes" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.in the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. we soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant immortality. instead, it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven't heard since you last watched "scooby doo" cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (dickinson) one dark night. she escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate.so is this guy a vampire? no. there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. the sculptor doesn't drink his victims' blood -- he collects it. how? don't know. we only see him attacking, never collecting. why? to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. once it's finished, sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.the final analysis:"the norliss tapes" wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason... it was garbage. as you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, ill-conceived mess. the acting and dialogue offer no better. this isn't even a contender for a "so bad it's good" award. sometimes bad is just bad.after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of "the norliss tapes," i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10/15/03. i wish i hadn't set myself up for the fall.having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, i can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis. either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of "the norliss tapes."pauly orchid -- october 17, 2003

after having seen and loved postal (yes, i actually loved postal), i decided to try another uwe boll film and i picked out seed because i happened to stumble on it in a local dvd-store and it's supposed to be one of his better films.while the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded into one of the most generic slasher films i've seen so far, including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par acting. it seems like boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot but after a while just gave up on it. maybe he should stick to comedy?! the few good things about this film is that he does manage to create an overall creepy atmosphere, that the special effects are better than i expected and the soundtrack does go well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this film combined with the utter generic nature thereof makes he last half hour quite tedious to watch, which ruined my experience altogether. there are a very fairly well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. and let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times.i hope uwe boll will one day learn what makes a good film, because between a lot of horrible films he does seem to make a decent film every now and then. seed just isn't one of those.

this movie is unbelievably ridiculous. i love horror movies, but this is the worst one i've ever seen. i am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. it just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. the graphics look so obviously fake. the actors are awful as well. there is no real emotion from any of them. not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. if i could rate this a -10, i would. f*ck this movie. it's crap. don't watch it.

from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another jason's from friday the 13th. and it is... dispute that the movie starts interesting. but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone. he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to. i'm tired of it. for me it's all over the same thing.in another words - unreal. too many mistakes and confusing information.well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time :} for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars.

badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you are the sort of person who likes that ... see a shrink. even if you are that person it doesn't make this a good film, the acting is really poor, the story full of plot holes, the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one. i can see why people dislike uwe boll .. we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates. horror films can be full of desolation, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on ... seed is just really really poor.

the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie he releases  which is about two, three per year  immediately always receives negative ratings and harsh criticism. you're actually almost tempted to think this is just a contemporary hype. you know, like it's popular to hate uwe boll whether you liked his movies or not. let me just assure you that this is not the case. uwe boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry. "seed" is another most unfortunate of proof that. in here, boll tries so desperately hard to come across as controversial and shocking that he overlooks numerous other elements that any movie essentially needs to exist, like a plot, a narrative structure, character development, tension building "seed" is a hideous movie, full of gratuitous filth and incompetent padding footage. i once read that "seed" was uwe boll's interpretation of the nowadays popular horror trend of torture porn flicks, but that's not even close. the film inarguably does borrow some influences from "saw" and "hostel", but basically it's just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence. the first 45 minutes of "seed" are beyond boring and actually just confirm all the obvious things you already knew were going to happen. for you see, boll was stupid enough to begin his film with a (hyper- fast) scrolling text explaining there's a federal us law claiming that death row prisoners have to be set free if three attempts to electrocute them fail. so you know this will happen later on, but still the first three quarters are wasted on catching a serial killer and bringing him to the electric chair. seed is a mute serial killer who supposedly slaughtered 666 victims (exaggerate much?) who wears a bag over his head. he watches real-life animal cruelty footage (and thus we watch real-life animal cruelty footage; thanks for that mr. boll) and videotapes people as the slowly decompose in their cellar (including a crying baby which is really sick and twisted). when he's finally captured, during the most amateurish and implausible police manhunt ever filmed, and put on death row, the film even becomes more retarded. after being buried alive because the electric chair couldn't fry him, max seed crawls back to the surface and goes on a brand new killing spree; this time mainly focusing on the people who arrested and executed him. the senseless plot twists and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad; they're downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic. multiple twists and sub plot in "seed" are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind because they're just too dumb! nobody believes that cops and prison staff members will just bury a mass murderer alive without shooting a few bullets through his head first. nobody will accept that a fugitive convict cannot be found for another six months even though he went straight back to the exact same hideout place where they first caught him! "seed" is full of retarded little things like these and the movie gets dumber with each minute that passes. personally, i refuse to accept that the cast & crew members didn't notice this as well. it really makes you think that uwe boll simply neglects all advice and criticism, and just stubbornly shoots his movies the way he wants to. i imagine his yelling stuff like "shut up and do as you are told" to his actors whenever they remark that the scene they're shooting doesn't make a lick of sense. just for the fun of upsetting people, there's a gigantically overlong sequence where max seed smashes an elderly lady to death with a hammer whilst she's tied up to a chair in the middle of her own living room. instead of shocking, as boll intended it to be, this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is. "seed" is horrendous, it's disgusting, it's pitiable, it's  boll.

hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie i have ever seen. i feel like the movie was porely made, which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it. i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. which i can agree, saw as well is also very graphic, but, i did like the movie saw.the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well actually, it was probably around 5 min but still. i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll, and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one. one final note haha!! for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death, letting rot, with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a higher budget film, like saw for example. i cant believe people actually make movies like this. anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.

while not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations, this hunk of crud doesn't fare much better.boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn't make good movies. one of these days he'll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs.the acting was sub-par, the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and boll's special little 'touches' were seen throughout the whole thing.like all uwe boll movies, this one just shouldn't exist.plain and simple.just like uwe boll himself shouldn't exist. >_>

short version: seed isn't worthless. it's just derivative and inferior. and soulless.long version: if you have never seen any of the films comprising the vaguely-defined "psychological horror" genre, this movie will probably melt your face off. maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. the opening montage of real animal abuse will be sufficient to open your eyes to possibilities of brutality-on-video, and the (only) memorable gore scene later in the film will perhaps be more than you can handle. the climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has.but that's if you don't have much experience with the genre. if you've seen the real thing..."august underground's penance," for example, you will, as i did, find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film.other reviewers have compared this to the video nasties of old. i understand this comparison. like the video nasties, "seed" is more violent than a mainstream horror film and less subtle. but the reason the video nasties are still known to us is not only for the above reasons--those that are still popular had something special. permit me to be ambiguous, i think you will understand: those that have stuck around had "soul".take this quote from gabriele crisanti, director of "burial ground," on an interview on the new-ish dvd: "...we will never have more films like these, because today, technology has surpassed imagination. and technology is cold. so many things will disappear because small films like these won't be produced anymore. today we have great, exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold. today a horror, a terror film of this kind costs more than a million dollars. these films were not so expensive...they are real effects, made with our hands".perhaps it is wrong to take the comparison to old school horror so seriously. but crisanti has hit the nail on the head. even at their most seemingly exploitational, the best of the video nasties were pursuing a primitive "truth." and this is where boll falls short. it's like he's seen the movies and not understood them. everything on the checklist is there...bs about "making a statement about humanity," an obscene torture scene, etc. but it is, as crisanti puts it, "cold." the gore is all cgi. the whole thing feels like scenes pieced together from other movies of various genres. and the pacing is sooooo slow. man, so slow.another interesting note: the one gore scene really reminded me of a video game.anyway, enough bs. weak movie.

over the past year, uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker, cranking out the competent "in the name of the king" (a "lord of the rings" clone) and the proudly vulgar, post-9/11 satire "postal." but then came "seed," and the counter was reset to zero, keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach. and i'm a fan of the guyhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision, and are never dull.spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received, "seed" is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary, and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology (boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombie's successful reboot of "halloween"). the antagonist is maxwell seed (will sanderson), a mute, hulking brute who's slain 666 people and sits on death row, awaiting execution; after unsuccessfully frying the beast, he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there...and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem.trying to create a new-millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees, max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression, ultimately resembling a washed-up pro wrestler doing "the toolbox murders" on a succession of equally boring victims. furthermore, seed's character and boll's "message" run contrary to one another: the death penalty is wrong, sure, but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who's left a couple hundred corpses in his wake? i think not.meanwhile, michael pare acts like a listless, long-lost brother to james remar's character on "dexter": a cop who sits at his desk a lot, thumbing through newspaper clippings, and watching pointless stop-motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seed's lair. by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seed's hideout, the sequence is so drawn-out, ill-conceived (the lighting is almost non-existent), and unexciting (despite a healthy dose of gore) that it almost put me to sleep.the shoddy film-making isn't limited to just that sequence: "seed" appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer, since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly, a technique that's more stomach-turning than the gore itself; these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering, almost non-existent narrative. at 90 minutes, the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture, which might have been boll's intent all along.pure genius...i guess the joke's on me.

first off... i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named "seed" (which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about) i am close to joining the hate club. this movie makes absolutely no sense at all... the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90% of this movie is just plain boredom. you can sum up this movie like this: 1. hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv. this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of "making a statement about humanity" and giving a peta address. since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn-exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward.2. death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it.3. cops watch videos of animals, babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement, having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo. although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions... 4. cops bust seed in his house, act stupid and get slashed in the dark. this sequence reminds me of a video game, you barely see anything except flashlights. seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed... except for one who busts him.5. seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this "movie"... he won't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts. guess what... they just bury him alive to solve the problem.6. seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on.7. a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it. 8. seed captures the cops family, lures him to his house, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants (its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ... the movie has barely any dialog anyway so don't mind).9. boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3.this is it... no message, no plot, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child.this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value. i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment. its like watching august underground ... thats fine with me, some people will enjoy this brainless snuff. but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo-message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera-work, effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid. so how does boll get money to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets?? "seed" is not just the essence of ridiculous, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments.

consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll. somewhere, perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties', boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. gore whores, metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement. boll does his best to ride over these naysayers, exploiting tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers. the difference being that mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. maybe uwe knows it too.such is the level of hostility toward each new 'bollbuster' that imdb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it. boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage.this onslaught has made uwe a very thick skinned man, so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet, but one who feels as if he's bullied by the entire world. like most people in that situation he lashes out, determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding variety's review of house of the dead, never too far from the surface. this 'i know you are but what am i' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of postal, which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9/11, christian fundamentalism, jihad, nazism and paedophilia. such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their surname.in seed, shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation, boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer (is there any other kind?) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life. mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free, though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to, they pronounce him legally dead and bury him, only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers.boll begins his 'exploration of nihilistic rage' with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes. from there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade  kidnapping dogs, babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food. we're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition. yes, we're worthless, gormless sadists and worse than that, we won't give uwe a good rating on the imdb. in short, humanity is bunk.of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it's a bit of a bipolar piece, on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long, while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth.the result says nothing about society and its discontents, more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director. poor uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair, no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy's about dispatching various web critics. that it's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread, shows that boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements. he's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate. "i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun" boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it.

dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young mafia would-to-be killer (chandler) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some lessons with a very known professional killer (beluschi). first and most important task: to kill a young woman (lee) that is a completely strange for all of them. but is she a easy target? the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine; even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie. good performance by chandler. i give this a 4 (four).

i can't believe the positive reviews of this movie - i thought it was one of the worst, most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen. and the plot was completely ludicrous (sp?). she starts making out with him while he's tied to the chair? puh-lease. the worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good, laughable way. just plain terrible - i couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo. i thought belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit man. idk, i could go on - again, i am shocked by the positive reviews. the only thing that kept me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. and the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either! "live by the sword, die by the sword..." ridiculous.

i'll be honest- the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler's (most notably from early edition). since he usually plays the good guy, i wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). the plot itself also drew me in; a wanna-be hitman (tony greco- a.k.a. mr. chandler) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or, rather, the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in "the family". the movies was nothing like i expected. it was sick, i hated the end (if you saw it, you'd know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. basically- it was filthy, and made little sense. yes, it was a mob movie, and yes the guns do go boom. but there's more to a movie than that. this film acted as if it didn't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. the acting really made up for it- james belushi was pretty amusing as "the rose". sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get. she surprised me the most. and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to "the family". if only the script did justice to the actors.

this film is described as a action/comedy. the first 15 minutes and james belushi's presence point to it being a humorous gangster film.however, the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending. the film moves between comedy(description used loosely) and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in. the lead female (the angel of the title) is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable, extremes of character to be portrayed. james belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script. one to avoid.

it kept my attention to the end, however, without spoiling the film for anyone....... when she fixed the fridge by getting a book from the library, you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self defence against and assassin. the film, for me, said nothing of worth.... is becoming an assassin really a remedy for mental illness or just another symptom.

this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story, not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations. if the great m.r. james had ever come up with a tale this thin -- doesn't james in fact have a story called "a thin ghost"? -- he wouldn't have bothered to have it published.orson welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends, this film's producers. his presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o'-the-wisp its oscar nomination. this is yet more proof, if any more were needed, that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit.

i almost drowned in cheese watching this movie. in fact i could not even finish it. i want my money back. one more of hollywood's feeble attempts to come up with a new idea. good thing i keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. just in case. they should of gave nic cage a hat and a bull-whip. swashbucklin'. cage's performance in raising arizona or leaving las vegas beats this "lemon". people who are completely and totally marketed(and most of them are) should love this movie. if this film had been animated, i would have taken it more seriously. i would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. in my opinion, this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that fact.all the sheep seem to love it though.

wow, this movie was so horrible. i'm so glad i didn't have to pay money to see this horrible movie. it was like a history nut went on a coke binge! the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad. i will say the idea sounded decent but come on. it was really really bad. if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic. come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with. it wasn't like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle. it was completely ridiculous, and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one. all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top 10 worst films i've ever seen.

what does the " executive producer " do in a movie . if i remember correctly it's the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie . you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player . unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies " starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he's a major hollywood player , it's usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story/screenplay not being up to scratch protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat . likely ? as things progress ms davis ( who has problems being able to string two sentences together ) finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations . when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film's executive producer do you understand what i'm saying about the story/screenplay not being up to scratch ? exactly

how this film gains a 6.7 rating is beyond belief. it deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly should rank among imdb's worst 100 films of all time. national treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood. critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through.i love the justifications for this movie being good... "nicholas cage is cute." come on people, no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid. this has to be the most stupid, insulting movie i have ever seen. if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider kinsey, the woodsman, million dollar baby or sideways. national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films. i bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet.nicholas cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies. time after time i've seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like con air, the rock and face-off. when his talent is put to good use like in charlie kaufman's adaptation he is an incredible actor.bottom line - i'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again.

and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style.this was senseless ridiculous rubbish.its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived, poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen. it is appalling.nic cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over. i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films.diane kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke, she really can't act.harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe.only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world.

what a disappointment! i hated the mummy but this one was even worse! it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time. i can't believe that people actually liked this movie. the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing. the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings. the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn't very convincing either. i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes. what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment. what a drag... i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure.

i saw this film at its new york's high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore. although it was funny in some places, the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden, especially the "lovely lady" and the voice of the narrator (whom i have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. j.c.mac was, i felt, the redeeming feature of this film, true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing, this could have been a half decent film. let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain bin in lidl.

this should be a great film... meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers. mike nichols directing. uh uh. it's dull dull dull! pointless and predictable! slow and unfocused!it's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy' story. now theres an original concept! after squirming through two hours (was it only two? it felt like six.)i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera. it was done in 1986. i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget. i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade. it's not that it's such a bad picture. it's just that it's such an un-good one.

the movie was watchable while nicolson was on the screen. however, i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack; she was as bland as could be. the relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before -- and much better. it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of daily life is boring, and not worth writing about or watching. why ephron felt her life and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me. perhaps she wrote it as therapy -- for many writers, putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic. fine: but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.

you could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong. most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to. they play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways. the story is very simple. it could be summed up in a few words, but i'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film.i had to fast forward the parts where jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. i'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat. quite frankly, i'd rather not spend my time watching jack chew noisily with an open mouth. personally, i could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too.outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time. there were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging. when something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry.best not to look this one up.

if i were to create a movie thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. out of ten stars, i would rate it as follows:plot: zero stars video quality: zero stars sound quality: zero stars acting: zero starsit is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera, made up a plot and shot a movie. it is so lacking in any artistic value that i'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie.however, something is to be said for the abysymal depths. the "shootout" in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scenes ever. first of all, the combatants simply wave plastic guns at each other, jerking their arms back and forth to simulate recoil. the pair actually "duck" each other's non-existent bullets. no squibs, no sparks, no blanks, just waving spraypainted squirtguns around. if you want to see two grown men play "actor", give it a spin someday... after you have cleaned the fridge, combed the carpet, polished all of the doorknobs, raked the gravel, straightened the books on the shelf, etc.

i'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms "filmmaker", "film", or "movie" in connection with this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh.the writing: pathetic.the directing: pathetic.the acting: pathetic.the cinematography: too inept for words.the technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: none whatsoever.this lump of waste could hardly be called cinema. the majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than revenge quest. no, this is just a 10 car pile-up caught on video.we'll skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. to call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit. what little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing.the worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. there are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock "gun" sounds, or they were generated by mouth (yeah, you read that right). the filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a "shh" sound for the elevator doors; i guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. this is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. that doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes, however.if it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. the sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. picture this: the bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. a lady starts to run in fear. he raises his gun (an uzi), and shakes it. we hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. the woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face.bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence.in another sequence, one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. the bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. you may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place.i supposed alan deherrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. if there's any justice, there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it.should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and i would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from bladerunner, and the am radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie. try not to focus too hard on the plot; it will only hurt you more if you do.0 stars of 10. and that's being generous.

another made for tv piece of junk! this is an insult of a war movie (i use the word movie in it's loosest possible form!) i thought telly savalas's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video that's shown on tarrant on tv on a semi regular basis, but then i'd forgot he was involved in this! i'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me!! i like the bit (laughs sarcastically!) in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties. also the steam train the commando's are training on shows the jz (jugoslavia zeleznice, or yugoslav state railways) logo's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the makers have tried to black them out. why not just film in the uk, if that's where most of the film is set? cheap rubbish, and a waste of celluloid!

it really was that bad. on a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived "dirty dozen" tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in yugoslavia).i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for telly savalas in particular. he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in "the green berets" pretty much sums it up.other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so i won't repeat them here. but i will add that i'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that savalas wears on his big, bloated head. i'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at imdb.as far as i'm concerned, it's a "1" right across the board. if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than "the dirty dozen - the fatal mission".awful - avoid!!!!

the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. the good guys never die, unless its for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes its laughable. (where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? erik estrada? please!) and the whole idea, hijacking a train? how moronic is that! the germans know where you are going to go, its not like you can leave the track and drive away! what a waste. i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again. i mean, seriously, it felt like it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88!! 1988!! the a-team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie. only watch it if you need a good laugh. this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne.

"lies" tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. with very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "lies" quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam. with an almost 2 hour run, subtitles, and so little substance, "lies" is simply not recommendable.

i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography that i witnessed. the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes - and, not one is in the least bit erotic - sick is the more the feeling. the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. see it if you can stomach it - i still have flashbacks.

i was at first disgusted with director sun-woo jang because i had felt that he cheated me. jang had the potential to create a strong, deeply emotional film about sex and its effects on people, but instead chose to focus his strength on the pornography element more than the actual human element. i couldn't see the characters at first and his sloppy introduction which blended both realism and cinema together was amateurish at best  yet this film remained in my mind for days after i viewed it. what stayed with me wasn't the story, it wasn't the characters, nor was it the apparent pornographic nature of the film, but the transition that jang demonstrated between y and j. if you watch this film carefully, you will see that both begin in an exploration phase of their relationship, eager to jump into the unknown, but not quite certain the next step. as they continue to meet, exploring new avenues of pleasure, they continually jump between the aggressor and the aggressed. jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y. it is a very small change, and due to the graphic content of this film, it can easily be missed, but it is there. it becomes apparently clear near the end when j cannot live with y, as their meetings become less frequent, and j attempts to become a part of normal society. this was a huge and very exciting element to this film to see right before your eyes, but alas, it was the only element of this film worth viewing.i will ignore those that speak of this film as nothing more than pornographic, because there are human elements at the core of this film, as underdeveloped as they are, they are there. it is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers. what happens behind closed doors is never known  or so we should believe. while the act itself does becomes repetitive after a bit, director jang tries to change it up a bit with some constantly changing scenery. our characters are continually moving from hotel room to hotel room to best quench their thirst for each other's flesh. this is fun at first, but again, jang's repetitive streak seems to make it feel boring than exciting. this leads me to the biggest issue that i had with this film. jang had a great story with gojitmal, but where he failed (outside of the obvious choice to focus directly on the pornographic side) was that he took scenes, repeated them time and again, without changing in front of us to allow us to get to know the characters. where was jang going with this movie? did he want the sex to tell the stories, or did he believe the characters would? he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves. the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two, absolute unknowns, of this film. i have to give jang some credit for trying, but not much. he attempted to create some sub-stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking, but they just couldn't congeal well together. y's brother and j's wife were those plot points, but again, due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element, these stronger sub-stories became un-rememberable and down-right dull. maybe it was just how i viewed this film, but outside of the sexual scenes, nothing else worked together. we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed.finally, i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us, the viewers, closer to the emotions being felt by j and y. from what i can remember, and i am trying to push this film far from my mind, i don't remember any musical undertones. gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings. while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself, there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more. technically, this was a poor film. obviously an independent film in nature, it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature. i didn't see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above, i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough. this was no larry clark production; this was sub-par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release! overall, i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy, but i felt this film was rushed, repetitive, and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them. the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived. our characters were uneventful, our story was underdeveloped, and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex. to me, jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic  and it failed miserably. this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make.grade: ** out of *****

this movie is a rather odd mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film-noir to it. it's basically one messy heap of different genres, of which none really works out like it was supposed to.this movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor. he's a former child-star who always used to star in in happy comical- and musical productions at the start of his career. in this movie he picks a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the movie). but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie. i mean mickey rooney as a tough player? he's an extremely small boyish looking man. he actually was in his 30's already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a 16 year old. hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he is just doesn't look and feel right. he simply isn't convincing in his role.because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story also really feels as a messy one. somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot-line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all. it just isn't an interesting or compelling movie to watch. lászló kardos is also a director who has done only 10 movies in his lifetime, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 till 1957. he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with. his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high quality.let's also not forget that this is a '50's movie but yet it more feels like a '40's one or perhaps even as one from the '30's. this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black & white. generally speaking black & white movies from the '50's often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exception.it's a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence. it wasn't the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies, often simply as himself. i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music, since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie. the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original song.an awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney.4/10

i rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. after popping it into my dvd player i re-examined the jacket cover and even though i took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, i still could not read any of the production detail information about the film. this film is entitled evil on the jacket and had to locate it by going to faith films website to find out any linkage to it here on imdb.the filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good ... then, a line-reading actor spoke. oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. at first i thought i got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since i couldn't read the jacket... english dialog dubbed. if they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film might have been decent. i gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when i discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. yes, it is that bad! the jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great, so gave the one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialog. i do not recommend this one!

when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar, an arab potentate visiting washington, d.c., his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis. sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state. unknown to her however, the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen, in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali, or empty quarter. in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government, who are keen to build a military base there, need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem. sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her.a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire, but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy; this was, after all, the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters. (if the film had been made a couple of years later, in the wake of the iran/contra affair, its tone might have been different).the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty, sweet-natured, naive and not too bright. there is, however, a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone, and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (actually, that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). goldie tries her best to save this one, but never succeeds. part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. on the one hand sunny is a sweet, innocent country girl from oregon. on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl.the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material, and "protocol" is simply unfunny. whatever humour exists is tired and strained, relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who, apparently, all lust after western women, particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties, as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley/ nastassia kinski film "harem", about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman, and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day "mr smith goes to washington". sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen's duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah, but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as "cactus flower", "overboard" and ""housesitter", but "protocol" is not one of them. i have not seen all of her films, but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 3/10

as a horror-movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre, especially those which are the products of my native cinema. and i can say that that the "power of fear" (or "vedma" as the russian title of it) is one of the weakest film among them. firstly, it can't scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. frankly speaking, it's bad in all points: from the goofy plot (i don't know why the russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-america thriller. i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesn't thrill a bit) and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work. all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all, only spoke their english lines without any expression. and at the end i don't really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors? i think it was their wrong turn. at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing. the same i can say about so called "small american town backgrounds" which were shot in estonia and look like it. the only positive moment i found in the "power of fear" is the visual effects. they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film. and the music is ok, at least it doesn't irritate me. that's why i give it two stars. overall, if you want to see good horror film  don't waste your time and money on this boring flick. and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i'd advise you to find a copy of "viy or the spirit of evil". it's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as "power of fear" but much, much better.

ivan (valeri nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. he travels to this small town where it's said that a witch (ita ever) is terrorizing the community.his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her, and the town is wondering who murdered this woman...who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure. ivan is now being pursued by her spirit, or something, and he has to have faith, or something, to beat it.i really hate christian films. they are usually filled with lame actors, stupid storyline and minimal effects. not to mention that this isn't just a christian film...but a foreign one as well. the voice-over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing, because it is so high pitched and whiny. you won't miss much by missing out on this film.

nikolai gogol's story "viy" has been filmed again and released to home video in the us via faith films.the original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him. greatly expanded and set in america, though clearly filmed in russia (the houses,clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the english signs), this is an odd film that doesn't really work.part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods america but clearly isn't.there are also some weird, intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later. i'm not sure why they did that, even after watching the making of piece on the dvd) the other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful. its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera- or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps. i don't know if its faith films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the west (revealed in the making of piece).the film isn't very good. as i've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio. despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film. as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god.given the choice i'd give it a pass, even at a bargain bin price. my advice would be to find the 1960's version of the tale called viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god.

possibly very minor spoilersthis movie is billed as the first russian horror movie. unfortunately, as far as i am concerned, "the witch" (its russian title) will take a place of dishonor in the gallery of horrible russian movies. it is based on nikolai gogol's story "viy" which is a classic in russia. "based" is the key word here since no familiarity with the story is required. instead, the less you know about gogol, the better. it is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture. the spate of american remakes of foreign films is a prime example, but then again, sturgess turned kurosawa's seven samurai into the magnificent seven with splendid results, and kurosawa transferred shakespeare's macbeth into japan to make an incredibly powerful throne in blood, while king lear became a riveting ran. however, with "the witch," we have russians transplanting a russian classical tale onto the american soil. the movie was shot in estonia in english with the aim of dubbing it into english using american actors and have reasonably synchronous lip movements. as a natural consequence, lost is the colorful ukrainian background for the story, in comes a drab american small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book manual. gone is the boozy seminarian khoma brutus, instead we have a boozy journalist who is about to win pullitzer prize, and who at the same time writes about x-files-like events and frequents miss boobs contests. (i never thought pullitzer prize was given for that kind of writing, now i humbly stand corrected.) in a strange nod to russianness, the journalist is named ivan berkhoff. they should've named him john smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed, clichéd and generic than this movie. berkhoff goes to a town named castleville, gets stranded on a dirt road, staggers on until he finds a dilapidated house and is rather un-welcomed by an old crone. all that to the accompaniment of a radio announcement about the forces of evil being at their most powerful, and people better staying indoors and avoiding water. need i mention that it's raining really hard? after a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing, the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest, he's mistaken for a priest, and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights. at this point, the action supposedly starts. those who have time to kill are welcome to it. what is wrong with this film? everything, starting with the dialog and down to the prop department. the dialog which i heard in russian was clearly originally written in english, and it was compiled exclusively from clichés and platitudes picked from american films. the actors just as clearly struggled with english because the timing of their speech was labored and unnatural, and the russian dubbing followed suit. the acting is mostly atrocious, and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions. for the most part, they're just blank or you wish they were. the only exceptions being the sheriff played by lembit ulfsak, a fine estonian actor, and arnis lizitis who plays a wheelchair bound resident of castleville. oh, and a rooster of course who's absolutely natural on camera! i know actors complain of being upstaged by dogs and cats but when nikolaev is upstaged by a rooster it is a sad testimony to the general quality of acting in the film.there wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film, and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either. mind you, this comment's coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror. the film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the genre's inception. at a critical moment, the camera lingers lovingly on a kerosene lamp. the lamp promptly goes out. it must have seen a few horror movies, too. an example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment, a character jumps out of a bathtub and runs at the camera. he's wearing something the looks like loincloth! it doesn't get any more idiotic than this!those in russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller. i wasn't thrilled either. it was run-of-the-mill from start to finish. i particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town behaved as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie, except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not. therefore, some of them acted zombie-like just in case. the makers of the film say it's about finding faith. such a fine collections of idiotic actions, stupidly contrived moments, and, yes, clichés, doesn't deserve to be about finding faith. the movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum.

what's in here ?! let me tell you. it's the presence of (alec baldwin). he's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them. he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after. so not to mention (literally !) the matter of (steve mcqueen) being at the same role in the original because i don't want to make that comparison in the first place. i'm not a big fan or even a fan of (kim basinger), she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average ! and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty !!?? well, if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i'll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible ! and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger's legs ??!! it's surely insanity or bad tasting ? as i don't see them both as not sexy only, but ugly too ! and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what ?! i've just watched this movie so i'm dead already !. yet, what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the mostand of course i mean (jennifer tilly)..now we're talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette (marilyn monroe) however much more healthier !! (i can't help it, she was the only new and watchable thing in here !). (michael madsen) as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys, (james woods) is here to summarize the early events beside the pool (so the trailer would be by his voice later !) and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood's stuff so "do your thing, take your cash, and good luck as an actor in other movies !", the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography, so the main goods of it (the action, the thrill, ..) are here and fairly well-made, though any echo for deep meanings about (the kinds of betrayal) as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don't wait for it. ok, it's all in all another remake without anything special (except jennifer tilly's spicy moments !) so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn't end my review saying that (basinger) or anyone here did better than this movie.. it would be an insult because frankly.. anything is better than this movie!

any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. mcqueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said. mcqueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as doc, the film had excitement and suspense,baldwin and company made this into a comedy,i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film. and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors! did the makeup people have it in for michael, what were they thinking.if you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam peckinpah's direction get the original!

nowhere near the original. it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. but the directing is very poor. basinger is weak - without good directing. baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen. i watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of peckinpah's masterpiece, and i got what i thought. almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing. i wasn't even disappointed, i just don't know what they were trying to do. this remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.this is a complete waste of your time. save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:)))

don't even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on it's own merits, but when compared to the 1972 original (which is a classic) it's down right awful. and btw, somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book. this is silly, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. they are 2 completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does). if you used this criteria for all movies then "2001" would suck and so would "forest gump" and "silence of the lambs".

back when alec baldwin and kim basinger were a mercurial, hot-tempered, high-powered hollywood couple they filmed this (nearly) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 steve mcqueen-ali macgraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome. it almost worked the first time because mcqueen was such a vital presence on the screen--even stone silent and weary, you could sense his clock ticking, his cagey magnetism. baldwin is not in steve mcqueen's league, but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor--if so, this is not a showcase for his attributes. basinger does well and certainly looks good, but james woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role. a sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the '72 film and plays even worse here. as for the action scenes, they're pretty old hat, which causes one to wonder: why even remake the original? ** from ****

i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic. steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor. he has no passion in his play.also the action in the original "getaway" was fantastic. but the remake has no action! it is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. i don't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico. i think this is a mistake in the story.so i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like johnny depp or brad pitt...

spoilers throughout: the gettaway is mostly an action movie. and what action there is to!! shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy's.this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. but the movie itself didn't do it for me.the gettaway became really tiresome really quickly. the plot is overshadowed by one fight/chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in. in fact, by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning. i don't think bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here. the gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull. it really could have been better i think.bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives. sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale. didn't enjoy this one to much.

i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) a sam peckinpah movie, 2) featured steve mcqueen, ben johnson, and slim pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.by comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, kim basinger. mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.let's just get it said and out of the way -- alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role. like someone else points out, peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. by contrast baldwin, bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only michael madsen's and james woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. one viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.so i don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original. this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr. baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood. thank god for "team america" for putting him in his place.3/10

"this story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose-leaf system." when "politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only a decade old. and, the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group. advocating prohibition, and shutting down speakeasies, was a main concern for women at the time.good-natured marie dressler (as hattie burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. she wants the liquor-selling joints closed; and, is drafted into a mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally. ms. dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend polly moran (as ivy higgins) and her stuttering husband roscoe ates (as peter higgins). dressler's run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town; so, dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "parlor, bedroom, and bath." the film sounds much better than it turned out. the humor, frankly, isn't too good; and, it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations ("you look like madame queen" refers to an amos and andy character). and, the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well, this time. producers might have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on dressler and the characters played by william bakewell (as benny emerson) and karen morley (as myrtle burns).**** politics (7/25/31) charles reisner ~ marie dressler, polly moran, roscoe ates

tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn. the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner. just count the times tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. the old cliché about it "only happening in the movies" applies here in spades. then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. the static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. in fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. too bad that tieney's career never really gelled. i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. his ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough-guy best. anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.

the film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity. however, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here. the movie fixated on breasts, which soon became boring and i lost interest. if this was on tv, i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report. that's how boring i found this movie.

i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed. slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans todd's brand of humor. the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. maybe i missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience i am glad to be a man.

from the critical acclaim, i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins. the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot. and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity "over with." maybe i am too young to relate (i was four years old in 1976), but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings. the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. overall, slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, i would say skip this one.

the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it. the characters were stereotypical "white-trash", the movie's "plot" was stunted from the beginning, and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny. regretfully, that was the only funny thing in the movie. ms. jenkins would be better served if in the future, she would refrain from using her life-story to "entertain" people. it was simply that bad. the one positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the lack-of-quality of the film) is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker.

---what happened to these unlikeable people. alan arkin was, as usual, unfunny and just walks through the role. the kids are all a mess. mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way. and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad, mean movie? if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction, and not try in any way to do better, this is your film. all others, take a walk, read a book, or see something else.jane

this is a story of a jewish dysfunctional family. the parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house. the father, murray abromowitz, moves with his children to california, and moves around beverly hills so that his children can get the best education possible.things really become funny when marisa tomei, murray's niece, comes to lives with the group.the film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood.jessica walter costars as a woman who wants murray to move in with her since she wants a companion.carl reiner and rita moreno come in towards the end. they play murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; they're also the parents of tomei. in front of the children, reiner lets loose reminding murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along.the film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around beverly hills in their car. i guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self-esteem.

this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen. i'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog, so the language barrier wasn't an issue. i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. there is only one professional actor in the cast and i'm guessing no professional directors or writers.although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating. this is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back.the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length. however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give "lost in translation" a 10 as well.

as others have noted, this should have been an excellent hammer-style film, and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it... but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them) that it's all too overblown and self-important. this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr. rock finally realizes what he's done. the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight. freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.

not sure why this film was advertised as a wild, quirky, laugh filled comedy. there is not much in this movie that will entertain, nor amuse the moviegoer. annette bening (whose acting was touted as being oscar worthy) comes off here as mannered, with her performance seeming routine. brian cox's character is confusing and irritating, and the lead playing augusten  joseph cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role. the best thing about the film is evan rachel wood, but she is not enough to endorse this boring, unsavory film.the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason. i found some of the scenes distasteful (the scene with brian cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'you and me and everyone we know' and 'the squid and the whale'), some embarrassing, and most of them unsettling. i found the whole experience a waste of time. don't you waste your time

this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. so many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. this movie was the man's version of "mommy dearest." it depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god. someone told me it was funny. no way, i say! it is sick humor at best. the movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room. the best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through.

protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary. the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. unless you are a goldie hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.

my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her. everything about it stinks.as such it is a true classic.who gave it 10/10? were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one?everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film. it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire.

i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films, so when i saw protocol for $5.50 at walmart i purchased it. although mildly amusing, the film never really hits it a stride. some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose.then, of course, there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i'm concerned. i don't think this scene added to the movie at all. i don't like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some '60's burn out especially!in the end, although i'm glad to possess another hawn movie, i'm not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it!

this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this show...but i remembered this as being live-action. i don't think i ever saw the cartoon. but movie? maybe. i remember it very clearly. the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom. he even had the red jacket. it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him. the car/guy spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street. and then proceeded to drive off. that is all i remember. i really hope someone else out there remembers this too. if not, maybe i'm still crazy. but i'm hoping i'm not.

two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. we ought to have liked a man called sledge; but.....but... this picture is disagreeable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. since there is nobody in the story (good or bad) to warm up to, there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested. no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. sledge has a pretty girl friend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow.of the last 30 older movies rented from netflix or video vault, this was the rock bottom, the only true dud in the bunch.

it's possible that a man called sledge might have been done irreparable damage on the cutting room floor. maybe someone will demand a director's cut one day, but i seriously doubt it.james garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and in doing so brought a whole lot of americans over to fill the cast out. folks like dennis weaver, claude akins, john marley. and of course we have vic morrow who both wrote and directed this film.garner always gets cast as likable rogues because he's so darn good at playing them. but he has played serious and done it well in films like the children's hour and hour of the gun. he can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. but a man called sledge can't be counted as one of his successes.he's got the title role as luther sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. after partner tony young gets killed in a saloon and garner takes appropriate eastwood style measures, he's followed from the saloon by john marley.marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. garner gets his gang together for a heist.here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. certainly that was the case in the war wagon which some other reviewer cited. but in this one garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake us marshal dennis weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. that was just too much to swallow. if taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. but i will say for those who like the blood and guts of italian westerns, during that prison break there's enough there for three movies.that's not the whole thing, of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. but by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.the great movie singer of the thirties allan jones is listed in the credits. but for the life of me i can't find him in the film. maybe a chorus of the donkey serenade might have made this better.couldn't have hurt any.

there's not a drop of sunshine in "the sunshine boys", which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon's sole ironic moment. simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question "how long did vaudeville last, anyway?"). burns, who won a supporting oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. the noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of neil simon's screenplays; here, ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a tv commercial). at this point, matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give "the sunshine boys" some sunniness, yet walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from ****

allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films.i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies, but here he really falls totally flat on his face. even the one-liners seem to have deserted him. the really is no plot (bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare) - but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air, which just makes the thing even more witless and half-baked.it just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore. the best thing about this film (apart from the end credits coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it doesn't make for entertainment.

i do not recommend this movie , because it's inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory, this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert, (completetly different culture, i know i am from both tunisia and algeria), the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt, speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french, university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage, so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible, the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the "femme repudiee" segment which is s pure invention from the writer/director, things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever!!!

swing! is an important film because it's one of the remaining black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. it's also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton club--a time all but forgotten today.unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. however, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning. this is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown! and, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! it seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting i've seen in a very long time.still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture. just don't say i didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!

sniffing girl's panties kills a guy...and a stupid freaky puppet says a lot of stupid freaky things......my eyes could not leave the screen, my finger could not leave the fast forward button....i had to rewatch this spectacle to see if i had really experienced what i thought...i did.....god help us all!

somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed, zombie-like killers. the "guinea pigs" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons. this movie is awful, atrocious, and amazingly bad. it has little to no logic in the script. you really will have trouble following what is going on. it has no special effects. the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen. and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair(looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it) named george that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica(the leading "actress"). throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterings of this puppet. but wait...you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. none of the actors are good. there are just varying degrees of bad. the gore and "horror" aspects are especially ineptly filmed. the film really looks like an adolescent put it together. no coincidence henry sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! and how bout the ending? what happened? if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out. all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore!

there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is. it simply defies description. something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. the whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! i'm not making this stuff up. the computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.the "film" is total trash. surreal bad trash. spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.definitely one of the worst movies ever made. up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video boardinghouse, or boogeyman ii (both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on.

that's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs. a biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter jessica (debra hunter), who is in love with another biker (dale midkiff, from pet sematary), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. a small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies!if that isn't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song ("nightmare fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns "danger! danger!" just like the lost in space robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men!this filmed-in-florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. and, hey isn't that nypd blue's detective jill kirkendall turned cnn newscaster andrea thompson as one of oft-nude bimbos? sure is! supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985.score: 1 out of 10 (and i mean that in a good way!)

this was a cute movie until the ending. the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her. it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back. this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. it was a despicable movie for that reason.

i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars. the line about "have you even seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game, your gonna be glad ya did!

very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best (or was that the purpose of the film, to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks?) no romance here, no comedy either. acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies. man, can't you see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? try to be original yourself! a small budget is no excuse at all, first-time director neither. crappy, crappy, crappy. no wonder it only cost me one buck...

the broken is part of the after dark horrorfest iii. not a slasher or filled with gore. plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from france and writer/director sean ellis. a successful radiologist gina mcvay(lena headly)inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control. while attending her father's(richard jenkins)birthday party, the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason. things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a london street in a car identical to her own. gina sneaks to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father. she drives away and is involved in a head on collision. then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust. is gina beside herself? is she in a parallel world? her nightmares become more horrific...is she broken?kudos if you can figure this one out...it won't be easy. editing couldn't be any tighter. lighting is questionable. other players: melvil poupard, william armstrong, michelle duncan and ulrich thomsen.

this film really tries to hard. if your going to make a horror film, at least give it a reason to believe in to hook the viewer. you wait and wait through the film expecting for some grand explanation but it doesn't. instead it tries to be too clever ending and not revealing anything. what was the point of the movie ? where it's actually going ? and more importantly what the hell was going on . . . why were they there and how does it tie into anything? just another weak sci-fi horror. i love the fake reviews on imdb saying how great it is by related press releases to bump the movie (either that or people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2hrs at all.i'm not saying the film is better than the fragile, but at least that gave you reasoning and why things happened and has an end result. this doesn't and it just waffle's on with tons of padding to make everything feel scary. this film is about as low as when a stranger calls. god that was lame too. big tip, if your gonna make a horror, make it believable with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook into your story. because if there's no reasoning or believability then there's no firm hold on anything and it can't be scary. no disrespect to the cast or crew cause they did a good job. it's just the poor writing.

you gotta wonder how some flics ever get made... this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the moot. and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to pump some life into the story. the blue tint throughout the movie overshoots into 'yet again', which on its own would be depressing but here it's overkill. the idea that it's not a medical condition, not some house or gypsy or trinket curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, just winds up being much like taking a big swig out of an empty mug. some doppelgangers have super powers but others don't or don't know they do? it seems they're just as clueless as we are.it's a poor man's rip-off of "invasion of the body-snatchers" with keifer sutherland's "mirror" and "the sixth sense", were you to seriously botch those three together.

no,basically your watching something that doesn't make sense. to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story.a normal everyday to day women, is walking down a street then find's herself driving by in her own car. she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family.i specifically made an account to comment on this film, of how horribly written this was. the acting was great, the events were great, but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic. i'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this, usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking, what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing.spoiler starts__they had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. it was not elaborated on all during the film, and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened. nothing gets explained during the film. the main character shouldn't of even been the main character. at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away (her sisters boyfriend) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after. i bought this movie for $10, threw it out right after.. don't waste your time. i really hope nothing like this is made again.

have you ever had a cool image in your mind that you thought it would be nice to be in a movie: like seeing a detective peeking through the cracks of a broken fence of some abandoned house? or seeing a woman walking down a street looking cold and intense and awfully alert? yeah. imagine stretching that image to a whole movie, you pretty much got the idea of broken, though there's no detectives in this movie, i'm just using it as a visual example. but, the intense looking woman is here and she filled pretty much 99% of the screen time. i got nothing to complain about that woman, she's a perfect choice for this role.i consider myself a very open minded individual who can find enjoyment out of all kinds of artistic expressions and i can truly enjoy some really moody stuff. it would be really cool if i can frame one of the scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. let's be honest here, the acting is superb. some of the expressions on the actors face are what keep me watching.now onto the problem of this movie. beyond the mood, there's not much anything else here. the director basically took an obsession of an idea and ran it far beyond what it was worth. i don't consider it to be a spoiler if i say the obsession is "mirror". let's face it, this singular idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director got to work with. granted, there are a few twist and turn here and there. if you paid any attention, nothing is going to surprise you in the end, obvious plot holes aside.now, i'm not picking bones with this style of art since i enjoyed them most of the time. i still believe that we should judge an art base on the medium it uses to express whatever the artists want to express. movie is not a piece of music, or a picture, or a painting, or even a poem, and certainly not just a cool image in your mind. it's all that plus a good story and character development. i consider the lynch style of movie making cheating. it is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. we gave movies 2 hours running film time for a good reason. therefore, we should judge it differently than judging a single frame of imagery such as a photograph or a painting.this movie is not completely lynch style, thank goodness. it has a linear development and eventually came to a conclusion. it does not have much story or character development. it presented itself rather seriously with characters composed of common folks, thus distance itself from other fantasy stuff at least from the surface. it does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element nor did it ever attempt to build a coherent world around it. the oddity came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. maybe the coherency remains in director's head but from what i can see he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen.where did he put his effort in then? it seems that he spent a lot of effort in building the mood and enhancing it with the music. the music often built up tension which eventually turn into a tease. only in the later part of the movie the scare and tension materialized.in the end, i felt like: ok, i know what you are trying to say here but is that the point you are trying to make by spending two hours building up all these tension? it is rather irrelevant with who the characters are and what kind of life they have. and we are given very little about who the characters are. all we have is this circumstance that just took placed. disappointing but i guess the director did not have much material to work with and it shows.

i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. definitely, the broken is not one of those movies. i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments, they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. so, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. but though the movie was so slow in pace, it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. furthermore, if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one? i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! they're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, i guess. horror movies should have blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. for instance, the horror movie "train" with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with "hostel", it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message, it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, tv, safety/being pampered, etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons (believe it or not!), entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, death!

if the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate, everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck, because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here. if only the script was as shattering as the glass, then "the broken" would have been a brilliant film. now it's sadly just an overlong, derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences. sean ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie, but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating. i got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and "meaning" of the film. he thinks ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you're going to die. interesting theory, but i'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the internet about this, neither. personally, i just think "the broken" is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of "invasion of the body snatchers" but without the alien interference. "the broken" centers on the american mcvey family living in london, and particularly gina. when a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration, this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events. gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building. whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion, she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital. when dismissed, gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing. she doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes. does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her? writer/director sean ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script, but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them. "the broken" is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort, but only after just half an hour of film, you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package. there's a frustratingly high amount of "fake" suspense in this film. this means building up tension, through ominous music and eerie camera angels, when absolutely nothing has even happened so far. by the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in, these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore. some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly sean ellis' style with the repertoires of david lynch, stanley kubrick and even alfred hitchcock, but that is way, way  way too much honor. ps: what is up with that alternate spelling; the one with the scandinavian "ø"

what an incredible fall for sean ellis.you gather a bunch of your friends at home, all hyped about the follow up work of sean ellis. you have an vague idea of the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations.it is late at night, perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.15minutes passes and you start telling yourself it is bound to pick up, at 25mins you start wondering if you should just go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate the expected not existent subtle touches. over the half hour mark you realize half of your your hyped up audience is already asleep and call it a day.a few days later when you exhaust all other material to watch you go back to this, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself fastforwarding the unbelievably and needlessly long intermediate transitions and images. any other stuff i would have given up already but there is cashback and its legacy. but that legacy can only carry you so long, this is a new level of boring movie-making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with just descriptions, this is what it is.decent cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you in awe like cashback either. there are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time.final words, stay away.

i liked the initial premise to this film which is what led me to hunt it out but the problem i quickly found is that one pretty much knows what's going to happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take over everybody).there is no real twist (which is fine) , but the final reveal doesn't make a great deal of sense either (how can she be racked with uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if she's an evil id from beyond the mirror?).admittedly the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were chilling when they first appeared and the blonde's murder is also effectively creepy, but ultimately alas this seems to be a film in search of a story or a more engaging script, piling atmosphere upon atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite dull.

horror movie??really???? i cant believe how bad this movie was,what the point of this movie??? the movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it,is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident....not much talking at all,not even much actions at all.. i have to say tho,the last 20 minuets it got little tiny action.. and was still stupid....... and the end oh my god,i don't know where to begin,it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol.. don't get me wrong i love lena headey,i think she is great actress,but i don't know what got into her to do this movie.. don't waste your time and watching it,because this movie has no story,has no acting ..and has no point...not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever.

this film is pure, distilled, unadulterated boredom. i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room, took my seat. i was seduced by the "mysterious and suspenseful" blurb on the poster i suppose. also, lena headey is nice and unconventionally sexy, and richard jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around, so the cast seemed reasonable. it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on. i should've gone to see valkyrie for the second time instead.the thin plot revolves around headley's gina mcvey, her boyfriend, her father, her sister and her sister's husband who for some reason are being stalked, in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner, by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash. there could be a great film behind this idea (not exactly an original idea, mind you, but still...) and in fact, if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to headey's character's story, the broken could've made a reasonable 20-minute short. as it is, it is desperately unmotivated and boring, and terribly inconsistent.for instance, in one scene, a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it. in another scene, a mirror smashes in an empty room, and a doppelganger is visible as she "steps out" of the shards left hanging on the wall. so why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out? just for a little thrill? there are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly-lit london flats, peering around corners cos they thought they heard something, but seeing nothing there and moving on. we begin to wonder, why doesn't this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them? scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience. but we, the audience, will need to start threatening each other, in the darkness of the theater, if we want to have any thrills during the broken. by the way, once we've spent time with these evil doubles, we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them - they just stand around, blank looks on their faces, perhaps totally harmless after killing their others.there are some nice moods and touches throughout, and i dare say director sean ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time.

i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued. a woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car. well, i thought, this could be interesting......but it isn't. first, the title. the broken? the broken...what? what is broken? the...oh, wait...i get it, the title itself is "broken"! wow, clever! unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing going for it.the premise is not that bad, but i think kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirrors'. a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. a more suited title would be 'the boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages. or maybe 'the confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. it's just messed up.on the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to act.after watching the movie twice, i still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the e. a. poe or stephen king kind of way. do yourself a favor, and don't watch this one. simply put, there are better thrillers out there.

having read many of the comments here, i'm surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called "mirror image," starring vera miles. rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from "the broken." yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. some further observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cellphone! and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person who was driving the other car, or to the police who would have been required to do a report. my advice: skip this bore and watch the original instead!

this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen. every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - corey and danny are soo annoying. corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny's false promises.neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film. danny (dean paras) looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed - corey looks as if she's still in college.here in australia, this film is called too smooth; there is nothing smooth about this film at all. 1/10 avoid

a terrible storyline (amis at his worst), pointless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film (rather like "rancid aluminium") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted british film revival. the humour is, at best, limp, and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to grate.final summary - a half-baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no-one any favours. still, it's always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on screen...

this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucination.boringly directed by william marsh in over-saturated hues, a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking. and that's it. except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures, be it political or pampered. within the first reel you know exactly where this is going.what is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome, badly written bore? made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents! avoid.

holy crap. this was the worst film i have seen in a long time. all the performances are fine, but there is no plot. really! no plot! a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. ug... robert duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. this earns him the same responses over and over. i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens! sack

this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view.. sometimes it worked, other times it did not. tragedy that they changed the name for the us release though.. keep the apidistra flying is much better than the nothing title a merry war. acting was okay, script was okay.. overall it was a mediocre film..

in spite of sterling work by the supporting actors, and an intelligent script by alan plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character/actor. one of the characters describes richard e grant's character as "a whining little turd" and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly. there is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper-class publisher/friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. he is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. the part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate - a ewan mcgregor, for example.all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted, thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance. all i wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself.

the british 'heritage film' industry is out of control. there's nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why must they all be filmed by talentless nobodies? this film rips the guts out of orwell's tough novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'aspidistra' may not be orwell's best work, but no-one who reads it can forget its superb depiction of poverty. orwell emphasises not only the cold and the hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. in the novel, london is a bleak, grey, cold, heartless city, and comstock prays for it to be blasted away by a squadron of bombers. but this film irons out anything that might be in any way disturbing, and creates instead a jolly nostalgic trip to charming 1930s london, in which everything is lit with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of lambeth are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. comstock's poems about the sharp wind sweeping across the rubbish-strewn streets seem completely out of place in this chocolate-box world. worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, ancient jokes, and clunking dialogue. it's so frustrating because richard e. grant is the perfect person to play gordon comstock, and the film is packed with great actors. but it's all for nothing. this film made me so angry! britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its richness, complexity and power. and what do we do with it? we employ bland nobodies to turn it into soft-centred, anodyne pap for people who want to feel that they are 'getting some culture' while they drink their horlicks and quietly doze off.

i had high hopes for this film. i thought the premise interesting. i stuck through it, even though i found the acting, save helena bonham carter, unremarkable. i kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. maybe in george orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. if this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read orwell's classic. i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. if the film maker's message is "the mundane life is worth living", well then, they've succeeded. i would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.

as a wwii naval history buff, and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations, i was looking forward to seeing this movie. what a disappointing piece of schlock. i made it about 3/4 of the way through, but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene. the idea that a u-boat would fire a torpedo at a dde, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then be able to "run away" from the dde while submerged, is preposterous. and that's just a small detail. the whole movie was poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. i agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie. it's as if they decided that, since all those crappy wwii propaganda films were made with all-white casts, they needed to make one with black people. and as bad as those old movies were, this is actually worse. and it almost smacks of false advertising to headline ossie davis and stephen rea. it turns out they had very minor roles. i have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. i'm done. i've given way too much of my life this crap movie.

this is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the united states. (we are still working on it too.) however despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis. but even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. granted the script was terribly cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! i wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category. read some books about the true story of the u.s.s mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.

working at a video store i get to see quite a few movies and on occasion i try to watch some of the not so big movies. proud happened to be one of them. the initial idea of telling of the story of a primarily black crewed ship during wwii had some merit. however in less than 10 minutes of watching the movie you find out that the primary point of the movie was to tell about racial tension in wwii. the underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. this primary point is hammered at you to the point of excessiveness all throughout the movie. i commend the men that served on the uss mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and for the hardships that they endured. a movie should have been made focusing on the accomplishments these men did for themselves, the navy and for their country and not making a movie whose focus is racism during wwii.

i will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk. the movie was pretty terrible. all cliché, no real plot. historical and technical inaccuracies abound. look up the technical specs on de 529, or any everts class destroyer escort, and you will see what i mean. i now its black history month in the us, and im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. they did some escort work, chased a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. sorry, but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for. this movie makes them look like whiners. let the name calling commence, i can handle it.

full marks for the content of this film, as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii. a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. however, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. this could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the us was new, unique and also interesting. the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. it is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. i only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.

this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr. hartford's 8th grade social studies class -- way back in 67.what a waste, will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it.every time a scene had potential, all we were left with were a few clichés, combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action. shameful.ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest. the other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery.however, if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and aren't concerned with being awed or entertained, but want to learn about the uss mason, it is worth a watch.

i watched this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. a lot of the "time facts" were off. at the beginning of the movie, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when 9-11 hit. this movie was supposed to be taking place in 1994. also, one of the grandsons friends was wearing an eagles donovan mcnabb jersey. he hadn't even been drafted as of yet. the story line was good but the facts and actuality of the time frame was so far off base that it made the movie seem cheesy. my boyfriend is an avid reader of wwii books and memorabilia. i rented this movie hoping that it would be good. the acting was so-so. the dog was cute. but the way that this movie was carried out made me glad that i only paid 4 dollars to rent it as opposed to the 50 it would have taken me to watch it in a theater. i hope that who ever reads this understands that i mean no discontent to those who fought the war but the facts and time frame should have been a little more closely monitored.

it's a bad, very bad movie.well, for people a real realistic movie is a good thing. for me it is not. life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, senseless, sometimes. maybe that's the reason for people say that this film is real.too many common places: you're black, you're a criminal, you're doomed and cursed, whatever you do you'll end up by shooting or being shot by someone; don't let the kids play with the weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to the church, and then they are good, very good...before this one, i hadn't seen such a bad movie. that's perhaps the reason for i never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie. in this one, every scene shot in daytime, outdoor, is clearly and annoyingly blue. they didn't even care to correct the colour balance. oh! i've "rated" more than 300 movies in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.

over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities. the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken britain'. trainspotting, this is england, kidulthood, football factory, kes and from london to brighton.bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list. the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success. i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it (like the pursuit of happiness). i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but don't we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot? isn't it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner?i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors (like kidulthood, football factory) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch. there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned.

well it's not often that we in the uk have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the afro caribbean community, the last example that i can remember was the underrated babylon way back in 1980. so i had high expectations when i heard about bullet boy, a film that has been touted as the british version of la haine! well la haine it is not! i agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other british films of late, but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly.the film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in london, but i'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging. saul dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all, but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in london the only future is violence & tragedy

i love seth green. his appearances on that 70s' show is always worth watching but last night, i felt the show needed to overhauled. four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for. the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out. anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up. there did not seem to be much humor in it. i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night. i think they should go back, scrap this series, and start over. we need more family involved series. how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional siblings. the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it.

this sleek, sexy movie is a must-see. only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject left untouched, style of narration. the introduction grips you right away, and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really 'connect' with internal horror this film exhibits. the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully. not only for kids, but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience. ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography, it surely defines the word 'masterpiece'.

a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it. they never did. and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion.this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes, led by former nba star alex english, join his cause. not just a few of them join the cause. by the time his movement reaches its zenith, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more. just to move this review along, i'm prepared to grant them this premise. even though it would never happen in a million years, i'll just imagine it could, then go from there.i don't quite remember how, but some type of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. even if one does agree with the boy's stance, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed. and that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste. (peck, curtis, petersen). alex english does as well as he could have with his character however, and i wish he would try to act in more films. alas, it's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba. one wishes mr. english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better. alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop.as far as the film's message in concerned, it's just wrong-headed. plain and simple. all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war!!!!! it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. these weapons were in fact never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr.the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck's footsteps. kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck. the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars.if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, stick with dr. strangelove, instead.mr. newell, you are no frank capra!

i've no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot, but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money -- now.yeah, this is a plausible story, if you regard the alien abduction sequence in "life of brian" as plausible.this film is little more than a leftist pipedream. had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons, the result would've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war. bad as korea, vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were "proxy wars" fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement.this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. as if someone would say "mr. president, some kids at drastic high are not eating!" and ronald reagan would reply "my god! i'd better revise my defense policy!" right.like this film? wouldn't it be better if the soviet union would've collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build... wait, that happened!

i saw this in the summer of 1990. i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001.implausible plot. you'd have to be a child to think this could happen.i'm just really annoyed by it. don't see this.

this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war. as if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in cow dung collehe, the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy.the worst thing is that, while dangerous, the concept of a policy based on if the ussr and us went to war it could mean the end of the world, worked. the us and ussr never went to war.had we only conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a "win-able" war, in europe and asia was not unthinkable.not that i think they should get rid of this movie. it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "how not to make a film."it should be 0 stars or maybe black holes...

i saw this in the summer of 1990. i'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001.implausible plot. you'd have to be a child to think this could happen.i'm just really annoyed by it. don't see this.

i can't imagine anyone would ever, in a million years, want to watch this movie. not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it's about 20 years old and oh-so-out of the mainstream. i was trying to find out where i saw an actor before and this popped up. so, yeah, a kid stops playing little league because he doesn't like nukes, this prompts major media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. the end. a fantasy, to be sure, but one so cockeyed it would make john lennon blush. since terrorism has replaced communism as the -ism that scares the hell out of us, this movie really has no relevance, except as an (innaccurate) look back at those times. the writing, acting, and film craft are similarly undeveloped. the reason i rated it as highly as i did was because i watched this movie around 50 times while i was 5-6 years old and still have a little place in my heart for it, but i now realize that it doesn't quite cut mustard. so, if the law of large numbers holds true and someone eventually does decide to check out this movie, realize that there are much better ways to spend your time, but also much worse ones. (i will refrain from a john q. tirade for now.)

this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s.the idea that a kid and a basketball star could "change the world" is pretty far-fetched, given how many "children's peace marches" and "celebrity protests" there were and are.but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik kids learned of a "silent protest" in the west, is ludicrous.what ended the cold war? america's tough, dare i say "reaganesque" stance and the internal failures of socialism. it was not the peace marches, the "die-ins" or films like "amazing grace & chuck", "miracle mile", or "testament".

this movie is a bad memory from my childhood. this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, anything else. at least that's what it was like when i was in elementary school. i just remember hating this movie. granted, i haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone: you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. trust me, pick anything else. even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that i can't remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, i felt the need to warn all of you against it.

i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's. this was, by far, the worst film i ever showed to the public. one thing that made it so bad was that it put on airs of trying to be a great, inspiring film. even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre. jamie lee curtis, in an early non-horror film role, demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act (she's still trying, but it isn't getting much better).i'm sorry, and here's the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball! even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck.this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv. it is not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you picked (because it can only be better than this).

this movie was awful. the ending was absolutely horrible. there was no plot to the movie whatsoever. the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones. their performances were excellent! the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. instead, robert duvall's and james earl jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. there was nothing special about any of the characters. the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. when the movie ended, i sat amazed...amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. it never happened! the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. it wasn't even a story. the entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. that's it. it was one day in the life (and death) of some southerners on a plantation. how much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie training day)? the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.

the title says it all. "tail gunner joe" was a tag given to the senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about world war ii aircraft. the rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. when the senator was practicing on the ground one day, he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. he couldn't have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. the gunnery officer responsible for that admitted, in public, before a camera, that he was responsible -- he had made the error, not the senator. the fact that the film did not report that fact, shows how one-sided it is. this film was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person.a much better program was the pbs special done on him. he was a hard working, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. he made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them.the popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, one=sided stories, so that they don't have to think.

the little mermaid is one of my absolute favorite disney movies. i'm sorry to say, however, that disney completely messed up when they made this sequel. i'll admit it has some good points to it. the songs aren't bad, and the animation is clean and clear. there is some humor, i'm sure--i don't remember, because after watching it i immediately banned it from appearing before my eyes again. the worst point of this movie is the plot. in this movie, ariel becomes her father. she forbids her daughter to go near the sea (yes, out of fear), just as she was forbidden to go near the land. i personally think that, given her past, ariel would maintain some of her headstrong ways and not treat her daughter like she herself was treated.besides this fact, ursula was replaced by a non-scary, pathetic sort of sea witch (the underfed, forgotten sister) who is more comical than scary. she, too, has some little underling to do her bidding--but she's not scarier or worse than ursula. ursula spoiled us with her believability for badness. this sea witch is a joke.to make matters worse, flounder is a fat, deep-voiced father (no longer the cute guppy we all know and love) and eric's voice is not even done by the same actor (something that always annoys me in a remake/sequel). (his voice difference was very obvious to me, by the way!) i felt that the only reason this movie was made was so that disney could catch a few fast dollars, something i hate to think about a corporation i actually really do enjoy. i felt that this plot lacked imagination. i know that this act (child following in the footsteps of a parent) happens, but ariel was different. that was what we loved so much about her. she had a dream, she fell in love, and she made that dream come true. until she appeared in this movie, that is. then she became just like the other adults. this isn't the ariel i know. and i don't like her.i know of some children who have enjoyed this film, and i know some adults who didn't mind it, either. but for me, and for all of you out there who have the utmost love for ariel, please don't see this movie. the ariel we know dies within, resurrected only for a song or two and one final scene that actually isn't bad (where she accepts the water back again)--although she takes very little part in the ending, regardless.

as a child the first installment ("the little mermaid") was my favorite movie. it was filled with great characters, songs, and a fun family film. a week or so again i watched this movie for the first time. i believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't surpass their original. i think that i feel this way possibly because i had high expectations and i have grown up. however, it is not a bad film.it starts when ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, melody. eric and ariel feel threatened by morgana (eurselas' sister), so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea. as melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go. trouble stirs up as morgana tries to take control of the seven seas.i don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out. i did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing. i think this is a good family film though overall!

this was the first sequel i'd seen (apart from return of jafar) and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. i was horribly disappointed.the storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. ariel and eric have a daughter, melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. she wants to become a mermaid. however, ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when melody finds out she's upset and angry. and she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. so she's happy swimming around, and ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid.the story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. and adding the fact that melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable.there's also a whole load of other new characters-tip and dash being two of them. they aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of timon or pumbaa! the songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. the animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements.another piece of advice-try to forget about ariel's original character while watching this movie. the beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. this is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to.however, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as cinderella ii. but it's not in the same league as the original. but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans.

though i've yet to review the movie in about two years, i remember exactly what made my opinion go as low as it did. having loved the original little mermaid, and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child could be, i decided i'd take the time to sit down and watch the sequel.disney, i've got a little message for you. if you don't have the original director and actors handy...you're just looking to get your butt whooped.in the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older ariel and her daughter, melody. my first big issue was that eric and the rest of the crew sang. yes, i understand that disney is big on sing-and-dance numbers, but really, that's what made eric my favorite prince. he was calm, collected, and a genuine gentleman that knew how to have fun. and he did. not. sing.and then there's the villain. oh, how could we forget the shivers that coursed down our spines whenever ursula slunk onto the screen, terrifying both ariel and audiences around the world? unfortunately, that gene was not passed on to her seemingly useless sister, morgana. nothing was ever, ever said about morgana in the first movie; she just pops out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. oh, how cute. the younger sister is ticked off and instead of going after the trident, decides to kidnap a month-old baby. gag me.other than being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, morgana was just very unorthodox. the same plan as her sister, the same minions (who, by the way, did not scare anyone. i had a three year old on my lap when i watched this movie, and she laughed hysterically.) she had no purpose being in there; i'd like to have seen mom be the villain. i'm sure she would have done a better job than little miss tish over there.king triton held none of the respect he'd earned from me in the first movie, and don't even get me started on scuttle, sebastian and flounder. triton was a stern but loving father in the first movie, and in the second, it's almost like he's lost his will to knock fear into the hearts of his subjects. scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his 'dingle-hopper' (yes, i'll admit it; i did call my fork a dingle-hopper from time to time after that). in this film, scuttle's all but forgotten. a supporting character even in the first, he at least added something to the movie. he was rich with a flavor the others didn't have, and in the sequel, they all but stripped it from him entirely. sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. disney, don't do that. don't even try to mess with our favorite crab. or our favorite little fat fish, who becomes a dad and has a multitude of very annoying children. he's fat, and he's bland, and he looks like he's going to flat line any second.the walrus and penguin were unneeded, and after a while, you just start to resent everyone. especially melody, who has no depth to her whatsoever.and one of these days, disney, i'm kicking out of my life.if i didn't love your originals so much.

i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much. it seems that disney, however, is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-dvd sequels. they deserve a razzie. several, in fact. i thought the idea had merit, but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better. what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films. mary poppins, aladdin, beauty and the beast, the lion king...even hercules and the hunchback of notre dame. they've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres.i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation.

i loved the first little mermaid. i know the songs, i love the characters and i love the story. i can't say anything like that about the little mermaid ii: return to the sea. it was terrible. let's start with the story. the plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. same situations, except in reverse! ariel wanted to live on land, her daughter melody (creative name) wants to live in the sea. ariel was tricked by ursula, melody is tricked by ursula's sister, morgana. ursula had a sister?? not sure where that came from. besides being a strange copy of the first movie, this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. now the characters: 1. ariel- what happened to her??!! no longer the spunky, headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie, she has now "grown up" and her personality went down the drain. her singing voice wasn't as strong either, due to either jodi benson being a lot older, or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. prince eric- while he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie, like all disney princes, somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. to top it off, he just can't seem to defend himself, and ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. sebastian- say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie, because a whiny, aggravating little crab just took his place. he also had no good songs in this movie. you can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible "under the sea" and "kiss the girl" from the first movie, and it is very sad. 4. flounder- they destroyed him!! he is not cute anymore, his voice is terrible, and he has kids now?? who's the mother??? 5. morgana- she appears to be ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother, who always picked ursula over her. so she plans to get king triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea. sound familiar? anyway, she's a very cliché villain and falls short of ursula's greatness as a villain. she epically fails at witchcraft, she's not very tough, and not threatening at all. 6.melody- ariel and eric's daughter. ironic name because she, unlike ariel, can't sing. her voice is annoying, her friends (a walrus and a penguin?? really?!) are not funny or likable, and she's exactly the same as ariel, in reverse and not as likable. skip this one. don't watch any disney sequel except for lion king 2. this movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories. i will look back at this movie and just laugh.

i don't quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10. what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. there are so many clichés in that flick, the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. there's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. it's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. watching it i couldn't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland. but.. maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation? who knows. definitely one of the oddest movies i've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! sorry.

this movie is funny and painful at the same time. the "cinemagic" almost gave me a seizure. despite what they imply, "cinemagic" is not some innovative technical procedure. it was "developed" as the result of an accident, and they used it because it disguised the fact that their "monsters" were so stupid-looking. i also don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is sid "pink".this movie is good for a laugh, if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200,000 dollars. it is entertaining; at least i can say that about it. the bat/rat/spider is the highlight.

**possible spoilers ahead**gerald mohr, a busy b-movie actor during the forties and fifties, leads an expedition to mars. before we get to the red planet we're entertained by romantic patter between mohr and scientist nora hayden; resident doofus jack kruschen; and the sight of les tremayne as another scientist sporting a billy-goat beard. the martian exteriors feature fake backdrops and tints ranging from red to pink-the "cinemagic" process touted in the ads. real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a three-eyed insect creature, an oversized venus fly-trap, and the unforgettable rat/bat/spider. the whole bizarre adventure is recalled by survivor hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs. the angry red planet reportedly has quite a cult following, and it probably picked up most of its adherents during the psychedelic sixties.

first off, i'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing. one comment that bad sf movies become good comedies is right on the mark. mst3000 made it's living off that.if you look at the angry red planet as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker. all the elements are there: the pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilariously infantile. the adolescent boy attitude toward sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good call on that one, guys!) making eyes at the buxom "scientist" with hair so red it's a wonder it doesn't set off the fire alarms. the ridiculous conception of mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red, yet one alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kid's toy. the comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. and of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. if these people had met e.t., they would have roasted him in two seconds flat! "ow" indeed!don't get me wrong. i rated this movie low. still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit, in your little kid core, it makes you jump a few times. okay, then don't admit it. i guess you were never 10.

the film begins with people on earth discovering that their rocket to mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in space near out planet. when it's retrieved, one of the crew members is ill, one is alive and the other two are missing. what happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member.while on mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters. oddly, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest i have seen on film. plus, in an odd attempt at realism, the production used a process called "cinemagic". unfortunately, this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of mars and the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed--it was that bad!! despite all the cheese, the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel. for lovers of the genre, it's well worth seeing. for others, you may just find the whole thing rather silly--see for yourself and decide.while by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci-fi film, compared with the films being made at the time, it stacks up pretty well.ps--when you watch the film, pay careful attention to dr. tremayne. he looks like the spitting image of dr. quest from the "jonny quest" cartoon! plus, he sounds and acts a lot like him, too.

it's telling that as of the entry of this comment, no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie. not surprisingly, cheesy science fiction doesn't appeal to them quite as much... if you like a good "b" movie, and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch, you will like this. if you don't have fun watching bad movies, this one's not for you.

this sci-fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. i agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late, late, late show viewers. space explorers on the planet mars fight off strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures. pretty cool.the cast includes les tremayne, naura hayden, gerald mohr and jack kruschen. get comfy and enjoy. don't feel bad if you nod off for a moment. i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss.

a spaceship returns from mars; about a couple of months earlier, a 4-person expedition had been sent to the red planet. most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there. the picture is saddled by inane, melodramatic dialog, typical of many sci-fi efforts of the fifties & sixties. note, for example, how the ship's commander (mohr) tells another crew member to 'stay there' for no reason; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem. later, the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside. the two he ordered to stay say 'no way' and follow out; i didn't have high hopes for the expedition's success by this point. there's much talk of 'ears twitching' and hugging a freeze-ray gun named 'cleo' (short for cleopatra, of course). it would at least be pretty funny, unintentionally, if the story didn't drag.there's a very slow pace to the whole thing; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship's window portals (which change color from red to blue), commenting on what they see, as they do outside actually exploring. the martian landscape, advertised as filmed in 'cinemagic,' usually resembles animation cut-outs, or drawings, shot through an orange-red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors, who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process. but i don't think it fools anyone over 10 years old. the one clever mention i did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality, so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista. oh, okay...i was amused by some of the astronauts' actions as they begin to explore; right off the bat, they test their freeze gun on a plant, killing it, just for the hell of it. then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider-rat monster. nice going, lady. look up next time. no wonder the 'intelligence' on mars gets upset and doesn't mind that one of the lower lifeforms, a giant amoeba, attacks the explorers. the acting isn't too impressive. mohr especially, had a very annoying technique, saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out - reminded me of it! the terror from beyond space. the ending is fairly anti-climactic; don't expect any huge revelations beyond the 'no more expeditions' with freeze guns named cleo.

this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background. it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream music.unfortunately, the td music is dull, and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim. too expensive a dvd for what it is.

first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere. however, i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version. i found this movie excruciatingly dull. all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie. i'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy. i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie. maybe i missed something, but i have to tell it like i see it. i rated it a "1". what can i say, u.s. oriented tastes, maybe.

reading my review of the house that screamed, many may assume that i'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered "classic" horror. this is not the case, as i'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. but admittedly, i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etc...types of horror films - so i do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - i can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film...i just don't...the house that screamed is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls. the heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases...) to keep the girls in line. she has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower (in their nightgowns no less (?!?)...), and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus...i can see why the house that screamed is often compared to suspiria (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that i could barely stay awake. i'm all for "tension" and "suspense" in horror films - but this film held neither for me. luckily, i wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one, so i can't say i was really disappointed - the house that screamed just reinforced the fact that i personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's. this isn't a hard and fast rule, but those that i have enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception. probably a "must-see" for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as i don't really know too many fans of that sort of material, i can't really recommend this one...4/10

if this could be rated a 0, it would be. from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull, plodding pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film.the plot is predictable, as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence. from a boring, unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation, watch one of the ilsa films. at least they're unapologetic and up-front about what they're trying to do. how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.it's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not arousing in any sense of the word. it is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.not even elvira's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is. avoid it at all costs.

i can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to argento's. his work is far more imaginative and vicious--and a lot more fun.the director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. the murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. it was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and i really didn't care when it was revealed. the cinematography isn't memorable, and the much-praised 19th century gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in. several of the actors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do.yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism, and lesbianism, but amazingly, they add very little spice or suspense. if you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.

60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she's brought to at the beginning of the movie. is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate, a monster, black-gloved killer, or supernatural evil? no, she's running from a bunch of bullies. for the other 40 minutes that follow, various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught, which doesn't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava. we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo, we get no sense of sinister mysteries/unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but doesn't quite know how to do it. we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says "something is seriously f-cking wrong here, man". when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students, he does so with quick-cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched "this-is-shocking" music blares in the background. none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here. it's all a bit clumsy and aimless, with no real sense of urgency or direction. a number of people are presented as suspects but there's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie. i like the first kill, the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background, but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste. i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child?

the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. how about this? you want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. however, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.

the 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right. every network had one, and they all lacked one thing originality. ricky lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. the english language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. titltes ranging from girl you a pigeon head and so on. how could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage? has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? the people who appear on this show were trash. the people who watched this show were trash. anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto dvd is trash. people wonder why americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs, its having shows like this tell them its ok to be 500lbs overweight, and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes. having such trash on tv has ruined morals.

i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off, but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful. i have found a holy grail, a real touchstone of bad cinema. if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with evel's awkward camera address monologue, then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur's butt. the script seems to be pasted together from press clippings, and esl textbooks. but..... i just can't believe how bad george hamilton is. he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue i can detect is "gosh i bet they think i am cute. really cute!". this is an epiphany! i now know how bad it can get.

practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play evel knieval than hamilton is anthony perkins, yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal (and as producer of the film, he wasn't likely to be fired or told he wasn't right for the part!) the early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks. the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white-leather, star-spangled gear spouting the world according to knieval as if to say, "don't worry. this film is about my youth, but i'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture." hamilton is preparing for a huge jump, yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife lyon both supports and derides him. he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity. this flip-flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed, but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters. hamilton, usually a suave and debonair persona, does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject's mannerisms and demeanor including his walk. his hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking. (he even pays minor tribute to knieval's many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in "scars" from the multitudinous accidents.) facially, he looks nothing like the real cyclist, but he does suggest him in his physical performance. lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife, though her 3-pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment. she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over. other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor, cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea-bitten sideshow barker. the film was made on a low budget, but the story is a rather low rent one anyway, so that doesn't affect it too badly. the makers wisely used actual butte, montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance. several of hamilton's antics are amusing, though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people's property! some of the real knieval's completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage, one of which features a mind-boggling "splatter" in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll. hamilton's then-wife (stewart) appears briefly as a nurse.

the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in "women in love." the script, taken from d. h. lawrence's novel, contains an endless flow of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric.what a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise; what an empty array of characters given such attention. in spite of high production values, this film comes across as tedious as its personnel.a revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies, dawdling nowhere, and fumbling every step of the way.

well, you might not actually see any women in love in this movie, but you'll certainly hear women talking about love, and men talking about love, and women talking about men, and men talking about women, and men talking about men, and everyone talking about death, and talking, and talking, until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all, like paint your bedroom or water your plants.welcome to the world of d.h. lawrence, where psycho-babble reigns supreme, and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are. spending time with the characters in a d.h. lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self-absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party. when i read "women in love," i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it, but since i couldn't, i was hoping they would at least strangle each other. alas, only one of them dies, not by strangulation, and i won't spoil it for you by telling which one, in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people.to give director ken russell his due, he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel. he throws out much of the psychological mumbo-jumbo that lawrence adored, and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts, so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields, two buck naked men wrestling by firelight, and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates (yup, buck naked again) roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass (i'm not kidding). glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun, the more dominant of the two sisters at the story's focus, and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material; anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russell's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified-looking cattle. oliver reed has one expression, an intense glower. the whole thing is over-written and over-directed, and it's deliriously campy. indeed, this vies with "mommie dearest" as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i've ever seen.grade: d

if you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the surprise. even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is anything but.as the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. they can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.what that translated to, is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. have shapes created, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it through a mind-numbing loop. and repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. if anything, the chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the "other" world. it gets no better as well, when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. while firmly dated, its dull colours, non-existent story, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans. don't waste time.

not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot. during the whole film, i was like...erm...what is this movie all about? i don't get the animations at all. probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s. during the film, there is a group of people walked out. after the movie, many people said, "that's it?" frankly speaking, i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award. if you are thinking of watching this film, i strongly recommend you not to. you will regret it. i'm not joking. you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it.

i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying " this movie reminded me of billy elliot " but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so it's mr hall who's making a fool of himself not me am i being a bit cruel on him ? no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain don't have - he has his foot in the door , he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next ? he gives the audience more of the same young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate . he is bullied at school and no one loves him . the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer . no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer . he has a macho waster of a father who thinks " ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says " ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet . i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet ... " yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days - not . come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses , so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to . i have often criticised channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times ( the land that time forgot at 6 am for example ) but they showed this at 2 am and for once they've got it spot on . considering the story involves politics , ballet dancing ( gawd i hate it ) lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers ( don't blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject - there was no need to refer to them ) there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either . of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot

a study in bad. bad acting, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. pieces of schlock don't come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this... thing. by the end of the "movie", you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place. poor malcolm mcdowell, was he short of cash or something? still thinking of seeing this? *spoilers ahoy*: if you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named "cytown", you will. avoid this, my movie-loving friends. avoid.

cash (now played by khrystyne haje in for angelina jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old age, said protector was played by elias koteas, an actual decent actor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. she leads a group of burned out cyborgs (that includes william katt, evan lurie and a human scientist played by zach galligan) against bounty hunter richard lynch. malcolm mcdowell has two minutes of screen time as lynch's employer. cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. the problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as mcdowell, katt and galligan are given little to do. haje is indeed a whiny heroine and lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (the one with van damme, the second one is just dull.) also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. as an action flick this is routine and by the numbers b-movie stuff and it is competently made, that's the only thing positive i can say about it.*1/2 out of 4-(poor)

years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. cash, a female cyborg, travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. on the run from recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), cash tries to find her way to cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs."cyborg 3: the recycler" is the third (& last so far) entry in the cyborg trilogy. the first film was originally planned to be a sequel to masters of the universe, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. cyborg 2: glass shadow was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder).this film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. the budget was obviously lower than cyborg 2, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the 90s were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs.the film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime ova series armitage iii uses it to a greater extent). but the film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. the visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects.the acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (khrystyne haje) being the single worst performer on display. instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she acts all whiny & sullen. her co-stars are much better, malcolm mcdowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in & richard lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain. of particular note is andrew byniarski, playing lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in the texas chainsaw massacre remake & its prequel.

i wouldn't give this movie a rating, it's not worthy. i watched it only because i'm a pfieffer fan. i love her and would watch anything she made. even in this dud, she didn't disappoint. every scene with her in it, kept the viewer watching...waiting...for something to happen but nothing ever did. it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started. some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it.pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely. the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good. i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i can't find something to like about it, but this was a dud. i don't understand. the worst thing about it all, it had a big cliff hanger at the end. it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow, this film is finally going some place, then the credits roll. good grief. i agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting. well said. actually, that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well. i too wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.

so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills: natica jackson. or power, passion, murder as it is called in holland. when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality. unfortunately, it didn't.1) the plot of the film is really confusing. there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. only they have nothing in common. throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. but it still hasn't.2) the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson. well it is, sometimes. like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest. so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.to conclude my story, i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life, as i did.

i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan. i decided to watch it myself earlier this week.it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. she literally bumps into brian kerwin (a regular married guy with kids)after driving her car into the back of his. after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot.the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin. this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan, lois chiles, steven bauer & stella stevens. they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me. i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine.

really, they spelled it brain in the credits, not brian.ok, they didn't have the budget for a spell checker. all the production money went for great old cars. there are at least two packards visible here. one is a darin convertible. a nice yellow packard convertible.the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations. old cameras, an exterior of ciro's, street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there. poorly written and directed.my dvd says it runs for 104 minutes, approximately. it was more like 85 minutes. it came to an end without reaching a conclusion. there was a collision but no conclusion. the movie just smashed up against the credits. 99 cents for this. i paid 99 cents for this. i could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face as he emoted more excitement.for a few seconds in the ciro's scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call, it looked like, maybe... this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film. then it just sat there.the young latin actor played by steven bauer (tony montoya) could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here. this cast could have made a good film.i think if they cut brian's part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band, then they got something.here kitty, kitty...tom willett

we rented five movies for new year's eve weekend and watched this one first. all i can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one. it was pointless and vulgar. harvey keitel's script must have been easy to write -- just make two out every three words a curse word. andie mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll, but the movie has nothing else to recommend it.

interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work.when you see the film, maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did. i didn't really know who to root for in the movie, taye diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant.if the victim alicia(mia kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead. i can't understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work.

being the only movie i was able to see at this year's "nordische filmtage" at lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.this movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.first of all, the actors are not the best. but even better actors would not have rescued the movie. e.g. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. the so called "sex-scene" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. lynch, but of course without their geniality.so, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time... bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).

in reviewing this film i can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in july, august, and september of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth, fort polk, louisiana. take the high ground was not anything like i remember basic training.but one has to remember at the time this was post korea which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew them. it was not vietnam, a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit. the draft at that time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense.richard widmark is a veteran of korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas. the film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train. they're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade. one thing i will praise take the high ground for is the fact that mgm recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of william hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. it was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing.but i will say that a recruit like russ tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one. richard widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give jerome courtland confidence with a weapon. and no way would have he worried so much about robert arthur deserting. he's have just let the mps deal with him.of course being shot in and around fort bliss and el paso, texas did give take the high ground good authenticity. but view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day.i do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you weren't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95% of the time. but there ain't no way that karl malden would have slugged widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. both would have realized that would have undermined authority, something the military just doesn't let happen.i wish i could have said something better about take the high ground because i certainly like its talented cast, it's talented director richard brooks, even the silly theme by dimitri tiomkin and ned washington, fresh from their oscar a year before for high noon. the film actually got an oscar nomination for best screenplay and story by millard kaufman. it must have been for kaufman's vivid imagination.

if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror, don't bother with gawi. the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a-list work such as ringu, a tale of two sisters, cure, and ju-on (or even such good material as the eye or inner senses). those films brim with subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly non-western take on what's frightening. gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty-five years.the film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick, but it's a bad fit. one aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which? having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil-child subplot, but the situation is hopeless. clichés, crap characters, witless plotting, a dull ghost, ho hum.

we see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl, but whatever he tries they won't stay open. after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. so, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? oh what a great and always spooky story! well, that's what i hoping i could say. and 'hoping' was as good as it got. this is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before, but i went in thinking it was my first viewing. so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things, but like i said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. "nightmare' is just another type of it's field that adds a 'few' changes to the gruel. oh, please give me something that's a bit more fresh. it doesn't have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired j-horror flick. even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit.but in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. while, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it's murky lighting. the first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it's not trying to shock you. i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shut-eye. that might be harsh, but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don't really care what happens to them. the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. it just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous. the film's haunting ending is a high point, though.the film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. the performances tread a fine line, but gyu-ri kim is strong in the lead role.it's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. although, i found the handling of it rather lethargic, despite the odd effective chills. a standard effort all round i guess, but still it's equally missable.

this is the kind of film one watches in gape-jawed, horrified silence, and yet continues to watch, mesmerized, as if watching a train wreck in slow motion. and yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts are churning: "who on earth green-lighted this garbage?"some of the preceding user comments say things like, "a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy" -- an insult to children everywhere. that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over. others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond: so what? one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series (rocky and bullwinkle, avengers, flipper, mod squad, ad nauseam) would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be recreated. the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video: why bother with this?as for f. murray abraham, a fine actor of stage and screen... well, all i can say is, he must have been in trouble with the irs.run, don't walk, away from the television if this trash comes on!

this is far worse than those awful laurel and hardy cartoons of the 60s. they were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then stan and ollie resurgence. new audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. it was to be expected. but, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... i can't even think of a word. i'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another laurel and hardy revival, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. the impressionists (i hesitate to call them actors) do a vegas act and that's where it belongs. the plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. if this film was someone's first exposure to the real laurel and hardy, i'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. the only movie i hate worse than this is i spit on your grave. and, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to stan and ollie.

this "film" is a travesty. no, wait--an abomination. no, wait--this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors.i thought "inspector clouseau" with alan arkin (!) instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious, but even daring to "remake" stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money grubbing.mr. laurel and mr. hardy have been dead, respectively, since 1957 and 1965. why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l & h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me. i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn't disappointed. everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic, disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film-making. avoid this movie at all costs--you have been duly warned.

who was george c. scott? george c. scott was a renowned actor. practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it. now ol' george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie..., but he once said something that describes said movie to a t.i don't recall his exact words, but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting, but great acting cannot save bad writing. never has this little observation been truer than in "the all new adventures of laurel & hardy: for love or mummy".the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. bronson pinchot (laurel) and gailard sartain (hardy) not only look the parts, but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal (mannerisms and all). this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents. that said, this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to (you guessed it) writing.aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain (which was very "in character") and a brief gag involving a taxi, this movie is an absolute chore to sit through.problem # 1: too much time and effort went into the plot.i don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady. what i want is to see stan and ollie (or at least, their stand-ins). way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around.however, even if this movie had been all jokes, that would still leave us with......problem # 2: most of the jokes are what i would call "watered-down" slapstick. what do i mean by "watered down"?in slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect (ala looney tunes, 3 stooges...,or how about laurel & hardy?).in "watered-down" slapstick (as i define it), a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced, and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect.maybe an illustration would help:in looney tunes, daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd. his bill falls off and he puts it back on. that is classic slapstick.in this "gem", ollie accidentally bumps into some people. they turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue on their merry way. that's not slapstick. that's not even funny. that's just...boring...and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. it's as though they're this movie's bread and butter. the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny. granted, the example i just gave is the most extreme case, but i can only cut it so much slack.long story short: the film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot's and sartain's abilities to impersonate stan and ollie. instead, the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes. watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with.not a good movie, but an incredible sleeping aid.i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal (just so long as you steer clear of "atoll k" and "be big").

i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so i gave it a chance, from director gregor jordan (buffalo soldiers). basically ned kelly (heath ledger) is set up by the police, especially superintendent francis hare (geoffrey rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. that's really all i can say about the story, as i wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest. also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne, naomi watts as julia cook, laurence kinlan as dan kelly, philip barantini as steve hart, joel edgerton as aaron sherritt, kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick, kerry condon as kate kelly, emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott. ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but i can't say i enjoyed it as i didn't look at it all. okay!

good grief i can't even begin to describe how poor this film is. don't get me wrong, i wasn't expecting much to begin with. let's face it, a pg-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm... slashing, so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore. but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away. we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. and here's a turnup for the books... she never changes - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again. on top of this, we're handed possibly the least intriguing (and definitely the least scary) killer ever to grace the genre. i'm not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie.finally, because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept (and apparently thirteen-year-old) director, what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time? closets, that's what. lots and lots of closets: big closets, small closets, mirrored closets, closets to narnia, so many damned closets you'll not want to dress yourself for another year. in fact this movie should have just been called "closet", and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case. on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert - something to the extent of: "what the f*@! did we just waste our time watching!"

okay. so i just got back. before i start my review, let me tell you one thing: i wanted to like this movie. i know i've been negative in the past, but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film. i didn't.it's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this. and it's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare (walking into a baseball bat left on the floor? are you kidding me?). it just wasn't scary. one thing i was surprised about: there was more blood than i thought there was going to be.. which isn't saying much.the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa's mom at her house. she comes in.. goes upstairs. camera pans to her father dead on the couch. spooky. she goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. finds her brother on his bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? he didn't have a spot of blood on him). killer comes in, donna hides under bed, mom dies. she runs outside screaming for help. killer behind her: "i did it for us." cut to therapy session. this confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back. filler dialogue ensues.they cut to the chase pretty quick. few scenes at the salon, they go to the hotel. of course the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped 3 days ago but the police/family weren't informed until he's already there). more filler ensues.i'm not going to go on about what happens in the film, because i don't want to spoil it too much. if you want to know who dies, horror_fan made a post about it already. but on the subjects of deaths: they weren't that exciting. people in the theatre actually laughed out loud (an experience i've never had before in a horror movie, not even in when a stranger calls) during several of them. one in particular: the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face i've ever seen. the only death involving any blood was lisa's, and that was pretty scarce. her throat is slashed, blood (if you can even call it that- it was practically black) splatters on the curtain-thing. the only other blood was on claire when we see her body. apparently, fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death. um, okay? the movie was one of the most clichéd i've ever seen. let's see here.. obligatory close-mirror-curtain-boom! scene. check. twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). mandatory backing-up-into-killer. check. there's also the backing-up-into-lamp scene, but you've all seen that. oh, you say you want a birds-flying-away scare? well, you got it! (yes, they managed to incorporate one of those in here). and, of course, the we-have-security-on-all-exits-but-he-still-escaped scene. shall i go on? i could.for anyone saying the characters weren't stupid, are you kidding me? "oh, even though the massive alarm is ringing, literally saying please vacate the building, and 3 of my friends are missing, i'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap." these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. the only likable character - lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie. "oh, i just realized the psycho-teacher is here! i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her! oh, shoot, the elevator is being to slow? guess i'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site!" ugh. by the end of the film, they all deserved to die. the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna's boyfriend (i can't even remember his name- is that bad?), and by that time, the audience was completely drained out of this scareless, clichéd film.there were some positives- the acting was decent for the most part, and it was well-shot. but that's about it.i'd give it a 1/5, and that's being generous. just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few), and brittany snow.oh, and the reaction was bad. very bad. people were boo-ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative. expect bad legs for this one.

and rent a good horror movie. it's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like "scream" and "scary movie".in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written. stupid "we're going to the prom" junk. i wanted to claw my ears off. honestly, "the hills" has better dialog.there really was no need to make this movie. leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking "her? really? guy is obsessed with her? really?" all the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (cover the place in teams of 2! front and back! not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed.) the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem. no resistance from victims (or doors). nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back (or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door). the people are like mentally disabled sheep.by the by, if you're a gore fan, you'll be disappointed too. all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done. (so boo hoo for you!) none of the killings is the least bit interesting. most of the time they've already happened by the time we find out.the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies. "oh kitty! you scared me! i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee!" and then at the end when it's time for the killer to die -- well, let's just say it's the easiest and most obvious choice. snore.the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout. it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough. don't encourage this kind of lazy film-making.(oh, and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen. no tiara. no bucket of blood.) so save your money and rent "carrie" or "friday the 13th" or "halloween" or "scream" or "scary movie" (any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.

imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the museums. you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. it's sold out. options? - the bank job, in bruges, the leatherheads or prom night. you've seen the bank job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and in bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. you don't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see prom night right? wrong. you take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. it would be money better spent.it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. probably both. an insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen (ben affleck and hayden christansan (i hate his acting so much i don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s)) so in summary 'not good'

i'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly peeved me off. the original prom night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! the scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. (a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) this film couldn't successfully pull that off, so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. there needs to be a likable hero or heroine. this film doesn't have one. the person i most identified with was the head detective. his calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. common sense approach to events that occur. (if you're running from an axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) if you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. and if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. these clichés are tired and well overplayed. in the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.

in bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher richard fenton (johnathon schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel (brittany snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. three years later, the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. on her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party. but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.the forgettable slash "prom night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. the stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer. the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. my vote is three.title (brazil): "a morte convida para dançar" ("the death invites to dance")

i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie"...enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those. it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall. i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development.the plot is just...well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, that's brilliant! hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me. her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression.please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then i wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine. can't believe this film got made!

from the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. in this film you will find none of that. the police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. we see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. i found the film a real chore to watch. it is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.

if deborah messing were not already cast as "grace", this might be a tolerable film. however, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (dermot mulroney) she reads about in a time magazine article to travel to london for her sister's london wedding. how new is this plot?neither funny, nor remotely romantic, the wedding date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and paid for escorts to pass off the film as four weddings without hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (amy adams). while messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30- something woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her tv series. if this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time.lots of drunken female bonding, cricket visual jokes, and mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending. expected messing sequel: divorce date.

there have been so many many films based on the same theme. single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending......this has been done many times.the thing is i knew this before starting to watch. but, despite this, i was still looking forward to it. in the right hands, with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.this was none of these.this was dire.a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me. i truly did not care if she "got her man" or remained single and unhappy.a male lead who, after a few of his endless words of wisdom, i wanted to kill. just to remove that smug look. i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment.a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have jobs, all of them had more money than sense, a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend....plus "i would miss you even if we had never met"!!!!! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross.....i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name "woody" but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film.

one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. "the wedding date" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to london, when basically, this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. then there is the problem with the stars. debra messing and dermot mulrooney? they have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!since the kat and nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. it's clear that kat will fall for nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. amy adams, who was the best asset in "junebug", comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.for anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes!

too much of something borrowed grade b-super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year. because of this, movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend. every few years a studio releases a counter-programming female skewing movie (2001's "the wedding planner") to compete with the big game. this super bowl weekend similarly titled "the wedding date" will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game. sick of people feeling sorry for her, single-woman, kat ellis (debra messing, tv's "will and grace") hires male escort nick ( dermot mulrony, "about schmidt") to pose as her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in london. her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married, and her ex- fiancé of seven years, who dumped her without a reason, is the best man. to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing. but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up, and let someone love her.the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. it is almost a carbon copy of 1999's "picture perfect" and mixes in scenes similar to "the wedding planner" and "my best friends wedding". the movie also has a reverse "pretty women" theme going for it, and knowing her audience, the director makes clever references to that and other films."the wedding date" has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie, there is the stereotypical overbearing mother (holland taylor, "legally blonde"), and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. the twist at the ending has been done before, but it was something that wasn't completely expected. the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour.even though "the wedding date" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. debra messing, in her first lead role, proves she can be charming and funny. dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing, but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. he is able to make best of what he is given, and be able to salvage the character. by the use of many clever puns (often sexual), the film is actually funny. although primarily a chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy. the feel good story, and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time.

seriously, i'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into miss congeniality as easily as goodfellas...but this movie? it doesn't make any sense!!!! and i'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. why does her family live in england? or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a british accent? she's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. (on that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long). and what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? i'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making. i'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on deborah messing's nose--i'd have sued the filmmakers if i were her! i mean, honestly, i'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of will and grace viewing, have i not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? oh! because those producers are kind to her! this movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. i can see both messing and mcdermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer.this easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies i've ever wasted time on. i'm just glad a friend loaned me her dvd, so all i wasted was time. if there were a way to make this review zero stars, i'd do it.

for romantic comedies, i often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience. unfortunately for "the wedding date," i can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.my apologies to fans of debra messing and dermot mulroney, but i did not see much chemistry between their two characters. the premise of the film is a reverse "pretty woman," with dermot playing the role of nick, a high-priced male escort hired by debra's character kat to accompany her to england for her sister's wedding. a romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. but the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. and there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of nick and kat.in a supporting role, amy adams was a standout as kat's sister. whenever amy came on screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. perhaps if amy adams had been cast in the role of kat, the film might have had more dynamism. but as it turned out, instead of reaching for kleenex, i was looking for the visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.

how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask? the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure. for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed, it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, the acting is bad, et cetera. i want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk.

as you all may know, jigsaw did not make its way to blackbuster because of a member of full moon's own staff, devin hamilton. devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains. he recently released a movie, bleed, which he was selling to blackbuster at the same time as jigsaw. he convinced the blackbuster buyer not to take any jigsaw, and double the number of bleed. the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop, and bleed looks like a hit. the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, jigsaw is, well, gold. i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged jigsaw, and all of your talents. likewise, you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it (if you already haven't). we need to get jigsaw up to at least an 8 or 8.5, and bleed down to around a 2 (thus putting it on the internet's 100 worst movie listing). also, try to convince friends and family to do the same.hope you all are doing well, - matt

this is a low-budget "scream" style movie. "maddy" is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office, where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker "chris". during a hot tub-party, chris and his friends convince maddy they belong to a "murder club" where everyone has killed someone for kicks. when maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue.the film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast), but, after the credits roll, you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.

*spoilers included*with a title like "bleed", you know the creative juices weren't running on high when this puppy was conceived. the movie is your basic run-of-the-mill low-budget slasher movie. oh sure, it tries to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn that was just a joke anyways. okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co-worker. he invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party, they tell her how they have a "murder club" and they murder people, blah blah blah. well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. now, the "members" of the murder club are being killed one by one. oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. by that time, you won't really care though.in retrospect, the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense. the motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained. i would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film, but on the dvd there are deleted scenes! i'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of "bleed", but apparently the people behind the dvd thought the viewers would be clamoring for more. on the box, it says there are easter eggs, but why the hell i would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me. i was expecting a bad movie, and "bleed" delivered on that front. it wasn't a fun bad movie though. everyone looks good in the movie, and there's plenty of nudity, but the acting is just awful. my least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer...i think he's supposed to be funny and amusing, but he just ends up coming off as a tool. i think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage, in a hilariously unconvincing death. heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole, and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing, and she spits out a mouthful of blood, and "dies". for those who think that movie making is an intricate, creative process done by professionals, check out "bleed". it will change your mind, and you'll realize any hack get can a movie made. otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this.

wow...speechless as to the making of this film, i can't say much. the coverbox at the local videostore should've said it all...nothing but 6 actors/actresses who get lost on the set of scream and decide to shoot a movie!the acting was apparently not in the budget, but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! style over substance almost makes its mark here, except most of these acting-class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script. after only 4 or 5 kills by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing tie-in plot about a murder club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join (only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car), you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this.i feel bad for the people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take it off their hands. another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials. throw it away if you did buy this.

let me being by saying the i followed watching this video by watching saw and after bleed, saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though i thought it was only fairly good. bleed is pretty bad. the best part is seeing the female cast nude. the gore is very fake looking and over-done. it has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and i didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending. if i could, i would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason being is that debbie rochon (maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and i've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures. they should not allowed to continue this madness.

this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror. debbie rochon's talent is completely wasted in this film. she is not even the villain. the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it.do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform "better than sex" it's total 80's disco candy song. nice up tempo song about gambleing & sex. way more entertaining than "bleed". put it this way, when one has the equipment to copy videos, but decides only to record the song at the end of movie, you have a really "bad" movie.

when you put this dvd into your player and hit "play," you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc. cherish this moment. make sure you have some tylenol or something (preferably pm's so you can fall asleep), because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts.starring a bunch of big-breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit, i thought i'd be in for a good time. sure, the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff (by the way, my sole chuckle was from julie strain's final comment in this scene). but then i knew there was trouble... the opening sequence had a terrible rock song. during this terrible rock song, i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said "topless in the backyard!" and "better than sex!". i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be.and that's the sad truth: the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast. other than that, it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an "innovative" concept about murder clubs, which ends up being fake anyway. so, the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery, but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters. i mean, when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman, can you really feel any sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life? the scream influence is prevalent throughout, with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes. we're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad (lloyd kaufman! the only other cool part of the movie!) about an abortion or something. uh. yeah... this isn't a "so-bad-it's-good" movie, it's just bad.someone compared this to a troma film, but... you know, most any film that comes from full moon (or its offshoot, as this film proves) is horrible. not horrible in a troma sense -- i've seen many troma films, and i can honestly say they all offer something, anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later. however, this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it. beware.

my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good 'halloween' take-off. a killer terrorizing young people, a white mask...you get my drift. we were dead wrong! no pun intended. we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! it is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. the actress who plays maddy is pretty, but that's about it. i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget--i always support movies like that. just not this particular one.this movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise don't bother. unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did!

sadly, more downs than ups. the plot was pretty decent. i mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. the other good thing was the cast. i'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. the rest was quite boring. another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. it's not that i'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'the dreamers'.unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of debbie rochon, than this is the movie for you. but if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.

a killer, wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat, is killing the friends of hollywood producer shawn banning(danny wolske)who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest. perhaps the psychopath is newly hired maddy(dabbie rochon), an attractive, raven haired beauty with a troubled family past, plagued with nightmares. shawn and his friends play a practical joke on maddy, concerning a supposed murder club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill. when maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person, she finds that shawn's pals were jerking her chain. but, shawn and his comrades are concerned about maddy's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities. deciding to wait on a definite decision, each member fall prey to the white-masked psycho with maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before. or, is someone else behind these murders? low budget slasher, executive produced by charles band, with gore murders that fail to convince. plenty of tits on display and allen nabors goofy character chris might entertain those with low expectations. the murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing, a neck sliced, an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape, an ax buried into the back of a male victim, and, to top it all, a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax(..for added effect, the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks). there are enough plot holes to drive a truck through, such as why maddy has nightmares of murders she didn't commit, how she could murder someone so violently(..with blood all over her)winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her, and how shawn could go so long, allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed, and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn't exist.what bothered me the most was the film's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone, later proclaiming it to be an accident. the film builds maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past. her family disowned her for an abortion. she has black-outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact. in a lot of slashers, the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring, but this film goes out of it's way to point the finger at maddy. when the twist occurs, we're left rooting for maddy, yet we know she's not right in the head. it's a tough sell caring for this chick. she does look great in a man's army shirt, though. and, rochon isn't afraid to let her puppies breathe, either. low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite brinke stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what maddy did, calling her a murderer as beloved troma producer lloyd kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge-wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about. cult siren julie strain has a minor cameo, showing her tits(of course)as the opening murdered male's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer. oh, and check out the office for which shawn works, you'll see a lot of full moon posters and art-work spread throughout the walls.

the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.i bought it ex-rental for £3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance.within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake. the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.as for the devin hamilton (writer and director), he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.avoid this film, if you see it in the shops run away.1/10

maddy (debbie rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker. when her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `murder club,' maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage (for denting her car!). but is maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it?the plot of this film (originally titled make 'em bleed) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous, out-of-left-field twist ending. some of the dialogue is downright laughable. i didn't have a problem with rochon's performance, but the supporting cast was atrocious. however, i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained. there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart. horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from brinke stevens and lloyd kaufman (as debbie's parents) and julie strain (an early victim).score: 4 out of 10

devin hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary full moon entertainment. sadly, his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years. however, in his short career hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories. now, this doesn't mean that his movies are good, but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre.in his debut, "bleed", hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre. maddy (debbie rochon) is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams. not only that, but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in shaun (danny wolske), it seems that life finally smiles for maddy after many sad events. until on a party with shaun's friends, they tell her that they created a "club" where members have to kill somebody to enter.obviously they are joking, but maddy wants desperately to fit in, that she actually murders someone. after that event, someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the "club" one by one. it is up to maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer, including her.maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful debbie rochon. it is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects. the concept is so original and rochon's performance is so good that it is a real shame that hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little bit better. the movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie.the rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. danny wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical. julie strain, brinke stevens & lloyd kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. also, there is lots of nudity (both male & female) and the cast is very good looking, so it is really a plus.the low-budget hurts the film in the effects department, as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); nevertheless, considering the budget, the film at least looks good.hamilton's more recent effort, the sexploitational venture "delta delta die!", is a better crafted and overall funnier film. while this one is not as bad as other better known films, it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of debbie rochon or fans of independent no-budget films. 4/10

odd slasher movie from producer charles band. in the days of full moon's greatest success band said that he would never make "real killer films" because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun. a nice philosophy and a true shame that band, having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. the team behind this one also worked on 'delta delta die!' and 'birth rite' - both equally bland by full moon standards. debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a 'murder club'. she - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not. the choice is there's and with regard to this movie its yours...not recommended but not entirely bad either.

quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, debbie gives another fine performance here. although her work in american nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film.the cast is filled with your typical melrose place types, chiseled features and seductive curves, that i had never seen before. other than debbie, laura nativo was the only actress i had seen before, in the similar delta delta die.the plot centers around a group of california arrogants who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique. they tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she fell for their joke.violence: $$$$$ (plentiful! debbie rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face. gore hounds will surely enjoy!)nudity: $$$$$ (plentiful as well! debbie rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors. the pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike. julie strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes).story: $$ (could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes. i understand that b-rate films use nudity often, but this is borderline excessive).acting: $ (the acting is sub standard to say the least. rochon is always a treat, easily the best b-rate actress in the business today, but her character in american nightmare was superior. danny wolske does a fine job as debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about).

another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film. it wasn't that bad. rochon does a serviceable job and damn! the cast is good looking. i've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis. this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer, but it was not to be. my biggest problem with the film was that by the end, i didn't much care who was the killer, and the real killer made little sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha, betcha didn't see that one coming, sucker!'. yeah, there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms. rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad. i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a gimmick. the dialog was overly think and painful at times.just don't have high expectations going into this, and it won't be that bad. and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.

renown writer mark redfield (as edgar allen poe) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as a baltimore, maryland magazine publisher. however, blackouts, delirium, and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts. he would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart, a significantly flawed prospect, as things turns out. mr. redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of edgar allen poe. redfield employs a lot of black and white, color, and trick photography to create mood. kevin g. shinnick (as dr. john moran) performs well, relatively speaking. it's not enough.

let's be honest. as a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this is a passably interesting film. as something to be released on dvd for an innocent viewer, it's a very poorly produced product. if i would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally, it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while. as a person who bought this dvd under the impression that i would be getting a proper cinematic product, i.e. a film, i feel deeply disappointed. it's a videotaped tv play, something along the line of old sixties serials, but without that certain charm. aside from the leading man mr redfield (who also is the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (a bit too old for that actually), or members of the director's household, who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches, but also the make-up artist or hairdresser (a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s). it's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds. synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame "period" inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion. the film attempts to be "dreamlike", whereas in fact it's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing (and believe me, the standards weren't too high to start with). there are interesting dialogs every now and then, but overall it's pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew. that's how "artsy" films attempted to look in the 80s. mr redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director.

this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over. poor directing, over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence. i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not. i'm not sure what makes the film worse. oliver stone does his worst directing ever. from scenes where woody harrelson's face morphs for no reason or robert downey jr's dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers, this movie is simply a mess.

god, what an awful thing ! oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here) but what for really ? the whole thing behind "natural born killers" seems to be a "clever" look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself. please mr. stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie ! michael haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways. how true... only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap !

natural born killers (1994)cinema cut: r director's cut: nc-17it's an unusual oliver stone picture, but when i read he was on drugs during the filming, i needed no further explanation. 'natural born killers' is a risky, mad, all out film-making that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic pictures.'natural born killers' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about mickey and mallory, and the teenager says 'murder is wrong.... but if i was a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory'. mickey describes this with a situation of 'frankenstein (the monster) and dr. frankenstein' - dr. frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killersmost oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america, the country that the director loves and admires. i guess 'natural born killers' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, americans are (and most of the world) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.the killers played by woody harrelson (mickey) and juliette lewis (mallory) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers. mickey and mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social darwinism (survival of the fittest) - mickey says in his interview in prison, that other species commit murder, we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film amounts to, in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour, rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to.two other interesting characters; first, a reporter who runs a show about 'america's maniacs' and is obsessed with boosting ratings, that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and mallory. the other is police officer scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at waco, texas by charles whitman.the cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).the camera work is insane; shaky, buzzy, it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it. highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual.'natural born killers' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers, it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute...although the above review sound quite positive, i did dislike the film. quentin tarantino, who originally wrote the script for the film, was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed. i can see why. while mildly interesting at times, natural born killers is a mess of a picture.4/10

*spoilers* some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. but this contention ignores the actual content of the film. oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. instead he lends them justification. the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. engaging in vicious stereotyping, stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-english speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. the one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using american-indian - because they're trendy, dude? let's make him an admirable character. fat, chinese clerks and "hicks" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. mickey and mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. justice is mocked. the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the gq murderers. again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the "reality" in the film. there is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. the film's "message" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. the clever message is nowhere to be seen.

you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  "herbie: fully loaded with crap" and yes it is true. this movie is really dreadful and totally lame.this got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen. the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie. i don't see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie, isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it? what i didn't like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle. i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining. little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.final words: unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie. what wastage of my money. i feel like cheated.rating: 3/10 (grade: f)

i wanted to love this movie. how could i not love it? cary grant, jayne mansfield, stanley donen; all icons in their own way. however, the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me. her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing my eyes or ears. i could barely make it through one viewing, that's how hideous she is in this.cary? gorgeous and in fine dramatic form. jayne? adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball. the supporting cast does alright, and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance.then you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief. who told this creature she could act?? oy vey, people.

while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review, i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities. both were made just a few years apart, both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies. however, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. kiss her for me, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some very broad performances--even when compared to operation petticoat. i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield. the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main.

oh dear, oh dear...for jm fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as her a-list hollywood career was concerned. after solid turns in girl can't help it, wayward bus, the burglar and rock hunter it seemed jayne was well on the way to becoming one of tinsel town's hottest stars. however, an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap euro loan-outs until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of suzy parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. many people blame poor jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. after all, cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? after a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing (simply for the sake of appearing with grant) to portray this squealing, idiotic menace. her character of alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. we all know jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. a real shame.steer clear of this so-called comedy. it's more depressing than funny.

there is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by cary grant, jayne mansfield, ray walston and werner klemperer. those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by stanley donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, damn yankees!, bedazzled and charade. for the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations might be met and then. nothing. what is supposed to be a light comedy, plunges into leaden, heavy handed melodrama, with nary a chuckle to be had.relative newcomer suzy parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a movie in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden, attacking parker seems unfair. not even as bright a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering, dreary and wholly pointless script, which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer's interest and patience down with it.the rest of the cast, especially ray walston, keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation. the desperate, inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film's final moments only serves to add insult to injury.this film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels.

this film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play--which flopped on broadway. the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii. they have 4 day's leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel. the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama--but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn't really pull it off. tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices. audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant, but had other commitments--so suzy parker stepped in. she had never acted before, but was america's top photographic model at the time. i think that she did a good job, considering all the pressure that she was under. grant's pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes--did not really work. the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant--but the character had no substance at all.

a good cast (with one major exception) pushes its way through epstein's smart light satire. mansfield was never better, or funnier, than she is here paired with walston, who's a veteran who's determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. he and his buddies -- including suave con-artist grant -- head to san francisco on leave and start the city's swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours. the only thing about this movie that's not delightful is suzy parker's one-note performance as grant's love interest, which takes up too much of the film's time and slows down the pace in the second half. walston and mansfield have good chemistry; the gimmick is that she's set on making love to every serviceman (to do her duty for the war effort, of course) but he's a married man who, nonetheless, loves his wife. they steal the movie with little trouble from grant (who's amusing here in the first part of the film, when not paired with his non-actor co-star.

not one of keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the talmadges. a polish/english language barrier and a series of coincidences leads buster into a marriage with a large irish woman, who (along with her father and brothers) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune. mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off.this metro short does have at least two real laughs - buster's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate. the other is a family photo, with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability.the yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags, but stops short (for all the buildup) of development.kino's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. not one of buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.

there seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since. given the very low average rating given to the film by other people, i think you may draw your own conclusions.this is a very bad film. i'll admit it, i thought the concept was kind of cute, and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work, but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known.acting: the leads seemed competent enough, but everyone else? terrible.plot: chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through.direction: non-existent.humour: did they really think people were going to laugh? oh boy.eye candy: ok. there were some really beautiful women in this film. not just the three main female characters, but right across the board. it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was. if so, they failed miserably.in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic. it wasn't even close.

i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end.i don't understand how this movie *genuinely* got any good reviews. i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes. their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job, which makes things more pitiful. movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones!! the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie, and not in a funny way. i don't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. i found the lead character to be irritating. his facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish. i thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded, but they were even worse. the script was also very awkward (his bosses overdone business speech) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks. i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.never have i felt that a rating was this misleading. i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else. of course see it if you want, but i just didn't want anyone else to get their hopes up/waste their time. maybe it is just me... probably not.

> you are warned this is a spoiler! > this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him. madeline kahn and john houseman were classic. dudley more god bless him could have done better. john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him. in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure. maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler,when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it.they must have paid the writers standard rates. to produce one chuckle.

in the questionable comedy vein of mel brooks, "wholly moses!" tries to take the bible story of moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest biblical spoof ever filmed.there is no real plot here, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. dudley moore and laraine newman are on a bus tour of the holy land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. there they read the story of herschel and zerelda, also played by moore and newman. herschel's life parallels moses'. he was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time moses was. herschel's birth father, the late james coco, becomes herschel's slave after herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. eventually herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending moses' flock of sheep. herschel and moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and herschel thinks god has chosen him to free his people in egypt. of course, moses was receiving the divine word, but herschel misunderstood. i'll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving moore and actors who are making "special appearances." these scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.jack gilford plays a tailor. dom deluise has maybe three lines when he meets herschel in the desert. john houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in "the paper chase." david l. lander is a fake blind man "healed" by herschel. andrea martin is one of zerelda's sisters. i was not sure who madeline kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. john ritter plays a very unfunny devil. richard pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! in the end, zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on new sodom's destruction, ha ha. herschel writes the ten commandments, and gives them to moses, who is basking in all the glory. in the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having herschel bait god into an argument. god comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the ten commandments. we even have zerelda quip "god works in mysterious ways," thereby excusing everyone's very unchristian behavior during the film.this film is not funny. there is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. at least monty python made fun of many established religious mainstays in "life of brian" in addition to their questionable take on jesus' life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. this makes mel brooks look like merchant/ivory. churchgoers will be offended, not by the film's attitude toward religion, but by the smugness the movie exhibits, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (i know, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. "wholly moses!" is wholly bad, and an embarassment to all involved. i suggest you read the book instead.this is rated (pg) for some physical violence, profanity, sexual references, and adult situations.

i'm sorry to report that i have seen this film several times. when it bombed at the box office, it was repeated nightly for about a month on hbo. and i watched it over and over because television in general is so bad--or was at that time. i no longer watch, so it might be wonderful now--like samuel l jackson says about swine, "it might taste like sweet potato pie, but i'll never know because i wouldn't eat the filthy mfer." let's see. dudley plays arthur wandering in the desert, always a few steps behind moses. it came out right after life of bryan, so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from. the few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth. there's one scene where arthur and dom deluise meet in the desert, both of them dragged out and dessicated, dying of thirst. then they meet like old acquaintances who didn't really know each other very well, promise to do lunch. it could have been funny.but the scene that i remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full king tut regalia. he must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release, they overdubbed his scene with the hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a jimmy walker wannabe (kid dyno-wannabe). or it might have been jimmy walker--who knows? who cares. they managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist, very unfunny, very long piece of excrement, one of those legendary things that just won't flush, no matter how many times you try, so you leave it there for someone else to deal with.well that's my review. if you rent this movie (don't buy it, whatever you do!) prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of corona.now that they've remade the poseiden adventure, this one is probably high on the list for remakes. maybe they'll hire a comedy writer this time.

the comeback starts off looking promising, with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer. the mask itself is pretty cool too, and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's slasher film "granny". from then on the film is mostly boring. we get a few more deaths, which again are good, but there's not enough of them. the reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody. the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part. i would avoid this unless you're a die-hard collector - there's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick.

linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, chuck traynor. i don't understand how having sex with a dog (which is animal abuse, as well) can be found to be entertaining or funny. linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films. i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. we call ourselves "civilized" however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized.

what can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd? nothing that would be positive. avoid this travesty at all costs. in any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa. i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! i am, by no means, a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's & 80's; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the (then illegal) stag loop.

ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful. it's an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america. also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent...it is the worst film i have seen in a long time

spoilers? maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. not like it would matter with this movie. air rage blatantly rips off the mid-air infiltration premise of executive decision. ice-t leads a team of four "elite" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd graders use when playing star wars on the playground) lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire. what entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look-alike has-been actors. you'll immediately recognize cyril o'reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it (it was porky's). here cyril plays a decent knock-off of a bill paxton character. most hilarious is porker gil gerard, who's so fat that you will never recognize him as tv's buck rogers. instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past, gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for john goodman. finally, alex cord gives us a nice hybrid look-alike performance as a chuck connors/kirk douglas type. in the 10 years since new jack city, ice-t's acting has deteriorated remarkably. it's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized. one of the items that plays into this movie is a cd-rom of classified information. it's being hand carried, and it's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted, despite the security-savvy aura of gerard's nsa character. what a joke. i'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the cd would ever even all be assembled into a portable format. despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the gunfire is about as loud as canned air, and causes nary a person to flinch, so apparently no foley budget. the assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. the flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. when she takes intuitively to the mini-uzi pistol, which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that's just too stupid. a true elite team would carry mp-5s for this type thing or maybe socomm .45s, or even customized hi- powers if they were really old school, or maybe something fn 5.7 if new school... the lame-o standard issue 92fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their cool after lethal weapon i. the bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have an assorted mixture of absurdity, like the aforementioned mini-uzi pistol and a tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that isn't a silencer. there was one touch of realism on which i would like to correct the other reviewers: the flight attendant and ice-t did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for "breathable air" before they opened the door. and i also got the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed, that she basically just gave up on that point. as far as the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. sigh. only the dukes of hazard eluding roscoe p. coltrane at the "pass" could shame this movie for use of stock footage. they obviously chose the incredible (and retired) sr-71 because they couldn't get stock of an f-117. aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the sr-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the b-2, and that at point blank range... well, i'm no expert, but i'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on radar. as others have pointed out, the repeated references to "f-15s" when they were showing f -16s was laughable. details of the 747 were pretty stupid. no airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring. wow. what a show. catch it on stars or something. don't pay to rent it, but do watch it for laughs. in contention for worst movie ever, right up there with no holds barred, which at least had some originality.

what a complete piece of trash. plot notwithstanding, when a movie's action revolves around airplanes, you'd think the writers/producers/director (or anyone!) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details. the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie. here are just a few: i'm glad i missed the sr-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the "air force one" f-117 spectacle. commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing 747  likely the (cheap) use of some boeing advertising/publicity footage by the director. exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring, much less multi-million dollar aircraft avionics wiring. airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air, and if they did rely on an on-board supply, the canister would be far bigger than fist sized. medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection. those were f-16s, not f-15s. mach 1+ (speed of sound) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff (watch the airspeed indicator). "standard formation" is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile, "route" formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept. "acquiring missile lock" is not likely to get an airline pilot's attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures. "wait for my signal" is not inter-flight communication for preparing to fire anything. depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank. yelling into a headset does not make it transmit. magnetic headings are given as "headings" not "bearings," and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees (compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground!), so turning left (not "port"  that's a boat thing) from a "bearing" of 618 to 502 is just stupid. it is in most cases impossible to just "turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached"  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again. the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely. airplanes don't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back, and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi-engine thrust. flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension, not seconds before landing (good way to crash). wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane, simply pulling the throttle(s) (this time a different lever in the movie) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed. did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f-16s and not f-15s? guess i did and that's just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie.

one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and, to be kind, acting of less than oscar caliber. but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft, and especially a 747. some of the major blunders:1. no flight engineer (or even a flight engineer station. 2. mis-identifying the f-16 interceptors as f-15's (no resmblance whatsoever). 3. loading passengers into an "aft baggage compartment" supposedly accesible from the cabin - even if such a compartment existed, placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable. 4. hollow point bullets that "won't damage the aircraft". 5. the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke. 6. an sr-71 (of all planes) with a pressure seal hatch 7. opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!ah nuts, it was just a truly lousy movie. gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year.

to be honest, i didn't like "executive decision" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. it is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. the film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.you can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.

when i first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago, i loved it. i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent, as is the music. but it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more. i find emma thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off thompson herself.i do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where willoughby in the book is redeemed? for someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.as for the actors, i love kate winslet as marianne. she is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality. alan rickman is great, a bit old perhaps, but he plays the role beautifully. and elizabeth spriggs, she is absolutely fantastic as always.

from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically

jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.the women are beautiful and the photography stunning. the dialog is inane. its a laughable mess. great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful. i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. at the same time is it a put on or not? its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to "mean" anything, and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle. something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women.

french director jean rollin isn't exactly known for great films, and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why. one of the most confusing things about this production is the title. for a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires; you would expect a film with the word 'nude' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one; but in fact, there's not a lot of nudity here at all. instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on; we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality, a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult, who don't get to do much. the film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young french man, who also happens to be the son of a man of importance. through his investigation, he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady, and as he delves deeper into the cult; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets, drinks blood and can't go out in daylight...sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me.jean rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film, but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed. it is possible to keep up with what's going on, but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one. the director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too, as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience. there is a twist thrown in at the end also; but the film would have been better without it. i guess this was jean rollin's attempt to be a little original, but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such, rather than a logical continuation of the story. the cinematography is fairly neat, with lots of the plot taking place in suitably gothic locations. the girls on board complete what is a pretty picture, and what rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency, it somewhat makes up for in style. in the film's defence, it was made in 1969; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but i can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of.

i thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous australian story. heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles, and gave their characters some personality; but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical.the beginning could have been a lot more involving; perhaps starting with a shootout, and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad tv soap.i was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something a lot better. the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version, but not by much.

i watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and liked it then. i remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. the second time around was not pleasant. the acting is 'so,so', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable.the acting...i'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. the plot...there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd. (side note: why did tt not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer! ding, ding...we have a crook!). it horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. it plays too much on sympathy b/c all of them die in the end (bar jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'they were so stupid; they deserve to die). you just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person.i can't believe this film rates over a 5.

without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years. the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. it's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions. oh no, the cops are on to us, they know who we are, what do we do?...let's rob one more bank then we're outta here! what!?! every character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who's gonna end up dead.

an interesting idea (four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by f. gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by takashi bufford and kate lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, gray, bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. it's melodrama at its worst. gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces. and bemused they are: although actors such as jada pinkett, kimberly elise and vivica a. fox have some raw talent (queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. steer clear.

after a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene, 'set it off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. this is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. in short, it's no different from 90% of hollywood product. but it's the racial angle that makes 'set it off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. posing as a celebration of 'sistahood', the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican-american 'gangsta' stereotype. the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. worse, 'set it off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to rodney king), and aspirational 'good' sista, jada pinkett smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. 'set it off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. while the likes of 'shaft' and 'superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'set it off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african-american film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.

we all knew even before it aired, the ron moore mini-series is no battlestar galactica. that's fine. it just means it must stand on its own. it can't lean on battlestar galactica. if it's any good, it's good on it's own merits, and ron moore has something to be proud of. if reports are true, this is what moore wanted. however, if his mini-series rots, he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on-screen, not to mention the myriad off-screen personnel. and this is what he's done.yes, this mini-series is no remake. i wouldn't even call it a re-imagining. it's a new production, inspired by battlestar galactica. it does not take place in the galactica universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. it doesn't tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica. ron moore's mini-series is a space-opera, action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica.maybe i should say, "just another" space-opera, action flick. because as plots go, his has little that's original, or even interesting. i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. but i won't inflict that on you. i'll just hit the most important point. ready now? here it is: just watch the trailer. it will tell you everything there is in the story.yes, creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man. (i guess they forgot azimov's rules, again.) they look like humans, so there's the whole aliens-among-us thing. at least there's no time-travel. oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came off more corny than respectful. i mean, couldn't he even think up anything of his own?from the first few minutes, i wanted to watch something else. i didn't care about any of moore's characters, since i couldn't identify with any of them. this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack. armageddon on a planetary scale, and i didn't give a damn. how depressing.moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, rather tucked tail and saved their own butts. after all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. they took the safe way out, rather than risking their own lives to defend others. at least disgust is not apathy.but in the end, the ron moore mini-series was just activity without purpose, a movie on a treadmill, forever running yet going nowhere. and i just wanted it to be over. and by the time it was over, my life-force had been sucked from me. against my own will, i was turning into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably of the type to which this mini-series would appeal. i needed to replenish myself. i needed to-and i swear this is true-i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5. two episodes, in fact, and i felt much better. and happier.

don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?such is how i felt watching this so-called "battlestar galactica". arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains, it's not what the fans ordered.imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned. you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip steak which you loved. when your meal arrives, you find they've applied the name "new york strip" to a chicken dish. you complain but the waiter merely states "but ze cheeken, ees really good zir"! do you really care if the chicken is good? you wanted new york strip - a steak! the waiter then explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to to do, as you zay, zomezing new. we felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh". you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called "new york strip" now on the menu, you'll never see the original new york strip - ever again.such is the case with creating something new and slapping the "battlestar galactica" namesake on it.* this mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! *it's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original. the team put in charge of resurrecting bg should have loved the original series - seeking to improve what the fans loved, not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the battlestar galactica name.if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show, then do so! give it a new name! don't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers. that effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future.we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as bg because we liked something about the original! we didn't simply want the name and remnants of the basic concept. there are things we loved about the original series!sadly, probably the best elements of the original were those which were omitted. sure, the original bg was imperfect and could have used some updating. this mini series, however, was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects (which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards).many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream.that being said... i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself (not in comparison to the original):the battle sequences were the best part. effort was obviously put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". i would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made-for-cable original movies. what was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? some views tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms. however, it was over-used considering there was no apparent source of these cameras. the infinitely more intelligent series, babylon 5, is the only instance i've seen such "live cams" used effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing action from security cams.the script, you ask? the script felt like it was written by a teenager, for other teenagers. the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. indeed, the whole story felt pieced together from other well-known stereotypes. the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series. it was obviously "dumbed down" for digestion of your average tv audience.the human interaction was pitiful. rather than drama based on subtle looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer. such was obvious in any interaction between adama and son. the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention. sorry, but real humans don't behave like the continually.i wouldn't have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own. nothing great; it will never be revered by true scifi fans or artisans, but it would be watchable by the masses. i personally could have lived without it, though. i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original. how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers. how even scifi channel has "dumbed down" its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the science fiction fans. it will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints.i leave you with only one thought - no "moore".

this movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it. for once, i should listened to the critics and passed on this one.despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. i can see now why it went straight to video. i had thought that with bloom, ledger, and rush it could have some value. all have done wonderful work in the past. the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. it won't satisfy even that.

this movie was so unrelentingly bad, i could hardly believe i was watching it. the directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between heath ledger and naomi watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. the characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. the acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. the film plays like a particularly bad t.v. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter. that's all very well, but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn't make the movie good. no one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans, but that doesn't mean i'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. a failure all around, though heath and orlando are lovely to look at.

ok, i admit i watched this movie on mystery science theater 3000 (which i am a huge fan of), but i am not one of those people who automatically gives an mst3k movie a 1/10 rating. although i hate many of the movies they play, and some are among of the worst movies i've ever seen, i have actually been able to enjoy some mst3k movies. that being said, this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. (it is no wonder, in fact, that the mst3k writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst. don't believe me? check out their site.)to me, this movie is a good example of what not to do in filmmaking. the dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic the direction (while perhaps being the best thing in this movie) is bad.the pacing is the worst part in this movie. a few times in this movie, the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. while minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time, it can be in a movie, particularly in this one. i'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but i was just very bored. it truly felt like ten minutes.if "suspension of disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie", then this has plenty of that. but the screaming skull is just so horrible, there is no way i could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film, and thus the "suspension of disbelief" was indeed non-existant.one of the worst, and probably the most boring movie i've ever seen.1/10

that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances. that sounds well and good, but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom. in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin. well trust me, no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners, and doors being knocked on. and the music is the worst, it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader. and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking. someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate. yes in the end this is a slow paced (which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour), boring little tale, that is easily figured out by the average person. apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person.

the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie. they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker. a young couple moves into a house, where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived. extremely boring, and very predictable. in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie.avoid this one at all costs.

i saw this movie on mystery science theater 300. it sucked so much. if i hadn't been watching it on mst3k, i probably would've thrown it out the window. the characters were incredibly lame and it didn't provide much of a plot in my opinion.

i am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the "halloween"s or "friday the thirteenth"s) - but i can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. and i'm pretty sure this isn't scary. what's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? in all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .) the plot concerns claus von bulow's third cousin (john hudson), who marries a donna-reed look-a-like (peggey webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. did i mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? ooooh!!!! wonder who did it!!!! this is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. if you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try "reversal of fortune". and btw, jeremy irons is one hundred times more talented than john hudson. the msting was okay but nothing special; paired with the "gumby" short, however, it makes for good viewing. two stars for "the screaming skull"; eight stars for the mst3k version. and now, to paraphrase mr. von bulow himself: "how bad is this film?" "you have no idea!"

after disney's witty live-action george of the jungle, i had high hopes for this flick. major disappointment. thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. this film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. i took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. the only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!

why?!! this was an insipid, uninspired and embarrassing film. the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it...pittsburgh pa! why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie there?when this movie was originally to be released...it was more of a romantic comedy...and no robo-anything. that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney. why???? they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either. sheesh!!

i really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography. but, even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really badly-made movie. the continuity and pacing were both simply awful. the best bits in the movie are under the ending credits, so it's (almost) worth sticking it out to the end (though, oddly, it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so).when the best performance in a movie is by andy dick, you know there's got to be a problem...

luckily i did not pay to see this movie. also, i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie. it was that bad. i laughed once, when the yahoo! billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came on. however, that was only because i thought it was making fun of it, but then i realized it was yet another product placement. i loved the cartoon. i used to watch it almost religiously. (although i missed the last episode. i heard that they show dr. claw and it was nothing more than a claw, somebody comment on the show's page) the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point. i hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of robocop. then broderick screws with the whole feeling of inspector gadget. he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was. another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point i saw, except for the oil slick. he also screwed with the tone of "wowsers" which used to be in an excited tone. i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. everybody else felt that way too. us 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.i went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon. i was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. it relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along. product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows. the wise-cracking car is not that good at cracking wise. the gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy. the cartoon was a better look. the silly scenes were crap. in the 40-45 minutes i watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the dudley-do-right preview. this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. i highly recommend "the iron giant," which was sad, but very very good. this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1

since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80's, i went to see this movie. i wasted my money. the plot was very thin. also, the movie could not keep me interested for long. i was glad it was over.if you want to see inspector gadget, watch the cartoon instead. it was much better than the movie.

i'm not quite sure why, but this movie just doesn't play the way it should. it should be humerous and fun, but instead is just boring. i think a large part of it is because they way over played the "gadgets." the old cartoon it is based on is much better.3/10

this is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible. obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny. what is it with the talking car with buttons that say wendy's, mcdonalds, m&m's and skittles? there was no talking car in the cartoon. (dr.) claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. why is rupert everet 'claw' anyway? were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? it looks like they were (badly) lampooning robo cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. i tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if i watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you don't get a refund. i'm sorry i watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap. after i was told the no-refund policy, i decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called inspector gadget.

if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability, you'll love this film. otherwise, you'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget.in the previews for the film, many scenes were shown which were not in the film, and within the film, some scenes just don't make sense. while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half, i can only think of one truly memorable moment, and that is just before or during the credits!

well. where to begin. let's just say this; avoid this movie at allcosts. it's based on a cartoon series. the movie makes the cartoon looklike hamlet. filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to behere, lousy camera work, terrible music, and enough product placement tomake you want to never visit yahoo! again, this movie is really thebottom of the barrel. to quote the new yorker, matthew broderick andrupert everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandonof men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance."they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it.awful.

i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series, and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen -- but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible. the pace was way too fast, there was no plot, and 'wowser!' - what the hell is that?? it was 'wowsers!!'.

i grew up watching the old inspector gadget cartoon as a kid. it was like get smart for kids. bumbling boob can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog brain and his niece penny. i had heard the live action movie was decent so i checked it out at the library. i rented this movie for free and felt i should have been paid to see this.broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting don adams had as the voice of gadget. his voice was all wrong. the girl who played penny looked nothing like the cartoon penny. she is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. but she does do a decent job given what she had to work with. dabney coleman gives a good performance as cheif quimby. saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by gadget.the gadget mobile was wrong. it never talked in the series and it did fine. why did they do this?gadget was too intelligent in this film. in the show he was a complete idiot. here he had a halfway decent intellect. it would have worked better if he was a moron.also the completely butchered the catchphrase. borderick says "wowser". it is and should always be "wowsers". it sounds lame with out the 's'. i got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase.the only decent gags were during the credits. the lacky for claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen/sidekicks. seated in the audience is mr. t, richard keil aka jaws of bond movie fame, a herve villacheze look alike, oddjob, kato and more. this is about the only part i laughed at.the other is at the end where penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin. don adams voices the dog saying that "brain isn't in right now. please leave your name at the sound of the woof. woof." of course this isn't laugh out loud funny, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear adams in the movie. he should have at least voiced the stupid car.kids will like this, anyone over 13 won't.

i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made. it had much the charm of "get smart". while it admittedly had its faults, it was rather enjoyable.naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version. that was before i saw it. afterwords i wished it had never been made.besides being miscast all around (who on earth though broderick was even close to the role?) it just didn't make the grade.the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action! what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude. it was fun. the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously. if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a "cartoon on film" it might have been enjoyable.as it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of the "gadget legacy".

once again, disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background. about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names. the most glaring errors are the characters - penny does not have her book, brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, dr claw is more a show-off than an evil villain, etc. but there are more than that. the horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget. and right in the beginning we see disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce brenda, who only serves to make this movie disney-compatible. add to this the fact that the "claw" seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline. what would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed, disney failed in that too. the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after brenda. as if to add insult to the injury, disney introduced the "new" gadgetmobile - it doesn't look, function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical "comic relief" figure. disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the clever running gags (like the assignment paper exploding in the chief's face) and replaced them with gadget being a moron, the gadgetmobile being a wise-ass, and "claw" showing off. someone should tell disney that "children's movie" doesn't imply "total lack of any brain usage". gadget should be targeted for children of 10-12 years... not children of 10-12 months like this movie. whatever this movie is supposed to be, it is not, repeat not, the real inspector gadget. because i love the old gadget, i hate this.

i grew up watching inspector gadget. it was, and still is, one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. i learned a lot of geography and history from the spin-off inspector gadget's field trip. i wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.but the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.matthew broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely not the role for inspector gadget. first thing- in the film, inspector gadget is smart. not so in the cartoon. in the film, gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself. in the cartoon, it was almost always penny, brain, and the awesome book (i still want her book!). if gadget solved the mystery, it was by accident. gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon was pretty dumb, which was where the humor came from.another thing is that it's too much "good guy v. bad guy" in the film. it's not just meant to be a silly saturday morning cartoon. also, gadget never should have a love story, but disney corporation is filled with idiots.also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had, and especially the gadget car. in the movie it was a chic convertible. in the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van. it also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.but if anything, the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie. inspector gadget was a silly saturday morning cartoon. the movie was too serious, too overdone, had too much of a plot and wasn't even remotely as funny.tip for those who haven't seen it: never see it. ever. watch the cartoon, it's a true classic.

why every horror director wants to imitate "the exorcist" is a complete riddle to me, as william friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. and yet here's another clean rip-off, a spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. paul naschy (who i must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. at first the priest doesn't believe it but when john's body is discovered with its neck twisted, leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... "exorcism" is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. this is just an awful film, end of story. other european "the excorcist" rip-offs are "the antichrist" and "beyond the door" and they suck as well!

while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. as a consequence of that, i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip-offs, and if exorcismo is anything to go by, i'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. it's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. like many spanish horror films, this one stars paul naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. exorcismo was directed by juan bosch, who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo 'the killer wore gloves'. i haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. there's not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. i certainly don't recommend it!

nahhh! leila (grace mills) is a teenager turned on to satan (and lsd) by her archaeologist fiancé richard. there's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle, where leila and richard drink blood, drop drugs, join in sex orgies, dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants, masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all. unfortunately, these kind of extracurricular activities have left leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded "spirit of evil." leila also comes from a screwed up family, which doesn't help either. her older brother john is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. her mother patricia (maria perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death. to top it off, her sister (maria kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) debbie gibson. there's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone), plus udo (luis induni), a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on leila changing clothes, takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. oh yeah and borg, the pet german shepherd.paul naschy is father adrian dunning, the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after john and richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. leila tells him "they say i am perverse and i'm going to prove it is true!" during her birthday party, she tells her guests "you make me sick! i hate you all!" and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches "i don't want to see that fat ass!" debbie suggests they commit leila to a "sanitory," but leila runs off and joins the cult again. she is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time).by this point in the movie, there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how leila is acting weird. it's almost as agonizing to sit through as an andy milligan movie, minus the gore and laughs. but finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an exorcist-like possession flick. unfortunately, the best part of it are the contact lenses leila gets to wear. some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms, legs and face, she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. she begins reeking of rotted flesh, spits up some clear gunk, starts speaking in her dead dad's voice, sneaks into her mom's bedroom, slaps her around a bit and calls her a "filthy bitch of a whore." in comes father adrian, who now finally believes she is indeed possessed, fends off her attempts at seduction, hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses leila with holy water. doors open and close, a mirror breaks, there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. after she tackles dunning and the two roll down the stairs, the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? why, borg the family pooch! the demon dog then turns on adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. it's leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. but then there's another time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. it's so badly done, you really have no clue what to make of it, which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless pos.screw the contacts, 1 out of 10 it is.

this movie was a stupid piece of crap. bad everything. why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns. it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval, kevin kostner, or tom selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worth messing with. for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s models. even the shooting was bad - in one scene the marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away. i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting.

i love westerns. i could watch them all day. "the good, the bad, and the ugly" is my all time favorite. i watched "silverado" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt. however, this movie, shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched. the acting was terrible all around. they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store. i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end. i turned it off half way through because it was so bad. to the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns.

i just got through watching this dvd at home. we love westerns, so my husband rented it. he started apologizing to me half way through. the saddles, costumes, accents--everything was off. the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. his only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left." we watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. i mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what's the point of that? and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. however, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.

there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running. if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail. i thought i had seen bad but this is it. a white van in a western. did they not catch this? oh well, and i paid top dollar at the rental. it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. the talking was so so slow, the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming. there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming. i say watch this movie, and move cabin boy into #2 on the worst of all time.

i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood. the acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful. i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do. i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees. it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap. i bet the movie was made in less than a day. i don't know what category it falls into. please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie.

where do they get the money to make films like this? i mean, there's nothing redeeming about this film. none of the actors are known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurry, the story wanders between being a bad version of repo man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable. for someone who watches all kinds of film, good and bad, i must admit that this film is about the worst i've seen since attack of the eye people back in the 50's. i don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, heaven forbid, art but this film would seem to appeal to no one. the story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who's a bad version of the celtic soul eater, although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones. the bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from. take it from there as that, alas, is the best part. my advice is that unless you are into bad mythology, amateurish writing, unconvincing acting and tedious settings, you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos.

....cause it's crap! the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say "why?". horrible camera work...count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't. the dialog is ridiculous. the acting is comical. it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible. i'd bet $10 they used home video cameras to make this. either that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie. if you ever want to host a "worst movie party", bring this one. want more entertainment...stare at a wall.

knowing enki bilal's comics for quite some time, i had to see this movie. i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience. i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend, and i thought i will enjoy watching it... i was wrong! the movie was a true torture to watch. the idea has potential... but, movie leaves way too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better. i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not. chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it, or that you're gonna see it - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes.

my first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the tv report scene, which i couldn't handle. it went approximately like this:reporter 1: hmm, there's a pyramid in our skies. reporter 2: i think it's aliens. *awkward silence* reporter 1: in other news...a few days later i watched it to the end, and it wasn't as horrible as i've imagined, but there are serious problems with this. about half of the plot can be easily discarded. and the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something.what use are the detective, the eugenics people, and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by horus? more amusing was the monopoly scene. "we're all powerful "gods", who have lived for aeons, and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly." monopoly? monopoly?! even erich von dainiken looks coherent, compared to that.the other half is terribly lacking. what did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? why was there no big event when he was released at the end? he had those pesky followers, remember? what happened to normal humans? what's the deal with the masked guy? how did the blue-haired girl appear? what's with her eyesight? etcetera, etcetera.visually it's ok, more or less, if you disregard the egyptian gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads.

the movie remains in the gray for far too long. very little gets explained as the movie progresses, with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch. it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i'm going to do that. it is that i watched this movie in the morning, i'm sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep. to me the movie was like a poor man's "blade runner".the movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities. it makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impression.also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much. the movie is halve cgi/halve real life but it's not done halve as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as "sin city" and "300". they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer, which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice, also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking. sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say.some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as; 'i'm going to do this but it's none of your concern why i want to do it'. than just don't say anything at all mr. horus! it's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie, if you don't care to explain anything about the plot. also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script.the actors still did their very best. they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special. so i can't say anything negative about them.the story and movie is far from original. it rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me.a failed and uninteresting movie experiment.3/10

i know i'm in the minority, but...uwe boll is about as talented as a frog. not even a toad; just a frog. he's reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another. this movie? is a crap-fest. slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things (like his failed relationship) on his mind. reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons, been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in the history of film. i'm voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. uwe boll has never done a single thing from which i've derived even the slightest pleasure. frankly, i'm satisfied that he made this stinker. i was concerned with bloodrayne competing with "underworld: evolution" for ticket sales. now, i'm confident that len wiseman has nothing, and i mean nothing, to worry about.this rates a 1.0/10 rating for this messy, convoluted crap-fest, from...the fiend :.

it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie. to put it bluntly, it's as if a dung monster defecated, ate the result, and then vomited. the final product would still outshine this movie.seemingly based on an ancient (!) atari video game, the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth, the unleashing of demons, and ancient civilizations. something about there being two worlds, that of darkness and that of light. (guess which one's ours.) oh, and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal, demons came over and had a blast, then wiped out the civilization. which is why we've never heard of them, conveniently enough.christian slater, perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume, plays edward carnby, a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old. he's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization. carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713, which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization. but carnby believed he wasn't going to be able to find the answers he sought, so he left the group.but see, these beasties are out, and they get their prey in varying ways, such as gutting them, splitting them down the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or just turning them into killing zombies. yes, it's another zombie movie.that's about as distilled i can make the plot. it's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible. in similar movies, one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time, and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher, it's a lot of fun. but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context... not so much fun.the acting is dreadful, save for slater, who (although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load. he had to; get this - tara reid is cast as a museum curator! honest to goodness, i thought i'd seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies. but reid here matches richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. hightlights include reid pronouncing "newfoundland" as "new fownd land," reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed, throaty monotone (kinda like she'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming), reid - a museum curator, mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans. oh yeah, she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes. oh, why must the pretty ones be so dumb? (note: i don't think tara reid's all that good looking. she looks like she's in perpetual need of food.) almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable, except perhaps for steven dorff, who played burke, one of the leaders of 713. dorff's character wasn't terribly well developed, but nothing in the movie was, from the sets to the characters to tara reid. but i digress.anyway, the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace, but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding, mind-deadening soundtrack; it's so loud you can't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes! that can't be right. given the acting level, however, perhaps thanks are in order to mr. boll.oh, and a fun note. the opening moments of the movie include narration... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time. remember the first star wars? you heard that now-familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled. there was surely no need for narration; why do i need some doofus to read what's on the screen for me? were the producers simply looking out for blind people? maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people. also, the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it. bizarre.alone in the dark is a loud, dopey mishmash of dreadful acting, an incoherent script, and ham-handed directing. hardly a note rings true. there's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise. even in the dark, the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.ironically, since there were only three other people in the theater, i watched this alone in the dark. i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way? i can't quite give this the lowest rating, because i had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it. it's atrocious, although slater redeems himself a tiny bit.

in 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness. when they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed. twenty-two years ago, the government paranormal research agency bureau 713 was directed by professor lionel hudgens (matthew walker), who performed experiments with orphan children. on the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator edward carnby (christian slater), who has just gotten an abkani artifact in south america, and is chased by a man with abilities. when an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to earth. with the support of the anthropologist aline cedrac (tara reid) and the leader of the bureau 713, cmdr. richard burke (stephen dorff), and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.in spite of having a charismatic good cast, leaded by christian slater, tara reid and stephen dorff, "alone in the dark" never works and is a complete mess, without development of characters or plot. the reason may be explained by the "brilliant" interview of director uwe boll in the extras of the dvd, where he says that "videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore". further, his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty-five years old. sorry, but i find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations. i have a daughter and a son, and i know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says. further, imdb provides excellent statistics to show that mr. uwe boll is absolutely wrong. my vote is three.title (brazil): "alone in the dark  o despertar do mal" ("alone in the dark  the awakening of the evil")

first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10, then i'd give it a -4. it's not that i'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is that bad. everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful. the story is not even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it is based on a video game, something i was not aware of going into the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed. honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. so do yourself a favor and don't watch it.

alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year. i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that.i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. a low budget dreck like red zone cuba, monster a go go and manos. or a huge budget disgrace like gigli, superbabies or this guff. you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director hasn't a clue. movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience.it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll (the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. the really terribly bad horror film. everything about it is a mess. cheesy cgi, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody. woo hoo! review over. give me a bud, roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again.don't watch this film.

0*'s christian slater, tara reid, stephen dorff, frank c. turner, mathew walker, will sanderson. directed by uwe boll.based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed. instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made! even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater, tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line, and some basic relativity of what's going on in the dark and the light. the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control. and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters. even though they did look cool and the feedings were well, a little lame. honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. my final rating 0/10.

....this mini does not get better with age. i saw this and it's sequel when originally broadcast, and like so many others was blown away. in early 2002 i borrowed the novels for both wow and w and r and was even more impressed. i then decided that i had to see both again and invested $200 plus on the dvd sets. i watched both minis again in painful detail and realized i had done things backwards - i should have purchased the novels and borrowed the dvd's.don't believe it is abysmally miscast? read the novels and see for yourself. don't think this is dated? screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs).according to the trivia section for this mini - dan curtis himself chose ali macgraw and robert mitchum. yikes!! production quality, music scoring, dialog - a great story was turned into a late 70's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer/director who was in way over his head. this thing was dated the minute it was completed.these two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then, tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. imo - this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints.

a wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue! no exaggeration - that's the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor. this tv mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up.that alone makes this completely unwatchable, despite the fact it's one of the best filmed wwii 'global' dramas tv has ever produced. if you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance. i'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story (pun intended). did they watch the film with their eyes closed? or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". i'm a boomer myself so don't think for a second i'm some hubristic young punk. 45 will always look 45. get used to it. deal with it. age gracefully damnit.the winds of war could have been... so good. how much more would we be talking about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role? right now, with the constant haggard old biddy distraction, that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war.

despite much style, flash, and glitter, this french musical fails to speak. the tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. the story is uninteresting, as are the many characters. people break into song and dance, without motivation or reason. most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.to be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. certainly a shame, to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort. goes to show, i guess, where followups (in this case, to the great classic, "umbrellas") often do go awry. one cannot recapture, only recreate.

the comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. those attracted to the intimacy and depth of umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the american style - awkward, stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. gene kelly's french accent was apparently so poor, that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember, the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in umbrellas). the translation of the french (for subtitled versions), as well, leaves something to be desired, although this can't be attributed to demy. the film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting, such as references in songs to legrand himself. and the costumes - well, the tight pants/white boots combination, and the freakishly unnatural colors, reminds one of an austin powers film . . .but demy does reward the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; note, for instance, the suitcase carried by maxence in his departure from rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by guy in his departure from cherbourg. also, note the "convenient brunette of resolution" - madeleine in umbrellas, and josette in young girls.generally speaking, those expecting the natural feel of umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene), or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in umbrella's script, should probably pass this one b y. those looking for a french version of a thin '60s american musical will be quite happy.

before writing this review, i went back and reread the reviews of others. this movie was a particular disappointment to me, since it features two of my favorite dancers, gene kelly and george chakiris, boasts a score by the often wonderous michel legrand ("wuthering heights," "ice station zebra," "the thomas crowne affair"). the dancing was stilted, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgettable, the story a joke. even the costuming was not particularly flattering. only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit. i'm glad other people enjoyed "the young girls of rochefort," though i most certainly did not.

what a disgrace! i was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered james garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! the production quality was fine, but the plot was undeniably lame and i can honestly say that i am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now. the movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out, it will give hallmark a bad name. for those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in this case, it's not a good thing. we are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth, who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her. she drags him through one mess after another, gets him into one embarrassing situation after another, and is proud of herself the whole time. then the movie ends. what a relief that was! not worth the time it would take to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is.

this film is the worst film i have ever seen. the story line is weak - i couldn't even follow it. the acting is high-schoolish. the sound track is irritating. the attempts at humor are not. the editing is horrible. the credits are even slow - i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting.

the funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of jules verne's classic "journey to the center of the earth" is verne spinning in his grave. the only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with "journey to the center of the earth" is the title. otherwise, everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching. in fact, the director has written here at imdb.com that he directed only eight minutes of "journey to the center of the earth" and the studio tacked on part of "dollman" helmer albert pyun's sequel to his own "alien from l.a." with kathy ireland. evidently, the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations, they grafted pyun's sequel onto director rusty lemorande's movie. please, don't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage.unlike director henry levin's period piece "journey to the center of the earth" (1959) with james mason and pat boone, lemorande's "journey to the center of the earth" takes place in contemporary times in hawaii. two fellows, a british nanny, and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence. richard (paul carafotes of "blind date") and his comic book obsessed brother bryan (ilan mitchell-smith of "weird science") are going out to explore a cave. the heroine, crystina (nicola cowper of "underworld"), works for a domestic service called 'nannies r us.' being a nanny has been crystina's life-long dream, but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs. nevertheless, her sympathetic supervisor, ms. ferry (lynda marshall of "africa express"), sends her to hawaii. crystina's new client, rock star billy foul (jeremy crutchley of "doomsday") who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career, has a dog named bernard. foul wants crystina to take bernard to a doggie day spa. crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals bernard in richard's jeep. you see, foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises. foul has disguised the dog as a human baby. anyway, crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow richard.after she catches up with them to get her dog, the cabbie cruises away and abandons her. crystina demands that richard drive her back to town, but he has other plans. unhappily, crystina joins the guys and they get lost, and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator, at the center of the earth. the rulers of atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist. our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident. atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera. the ruler of atlantis, general rykov (janet du plessis of "operation hit squad"), is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human, wanda saknussemm (kathy ireland of "necessary roughness"), to visit atlantis. predictably, general rykov machinations to rule atlantis and overthrow the earth fails, and our heroes and heroine save the day."journey to the center of the earth" is an abomination. the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships. albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors, but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga.

journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii, three of them siblings, and one of them a young british nanny babysitting a dog. when the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits, the nanny follows them (it might've just been safer to purchase more) all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore (i guess). for some reason, they actually go in the cave and then, when the place starts caving in, they try to get out to no avail, except for the six-year-old sister who they tell to go get help. meanwhile, the more they move around in the cave, the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core. and behold, it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn't want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own.i see that rusty lemorande, the named director of the film has provided comments on this film, in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l.a. well, whatever it was, it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits (a 1988 sci-fi film also made on a non-existent budget) because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film-making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth. i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times, funny, even if only in its subtleties. for example, the aliens asks the british girl if she's an alien and she explains that the ministry should be sending her work visa shortly. or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of altantis and he mistakes this for atlantic city, new jersey. little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable. imagine how great the film could've been though if they had 1) actually intended to make it, and 2) actually had money to make it.i do like how in the end, no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help. she'd just be wandering around the hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano, mind you.

who in the world told harrison ford that this was a good role for him???and josh hartnett...how does a 19 year old who can't fire a gun become a cop? over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film!!!

the movie was "ok". not bad, not good, just ok. if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far. sadly, fast and furious 2 also stunk, but i'd rather see this than ff2. :) if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk, this will be a "cute" movie for you. personally, i'd wait for hbo or blockbuster.

remember when harrison ford was the biggest star in hollywood because he made great movies? those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.while "hollywood homicide" is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. it's a comedy that's not particularly funny, and an action movie that's not especially exciting. an overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. hartnett is adequate, but he and ford aren't exactly newman and redford as far as chemistry is concerned.all in all, "hollywood homicide" is a reasonably amusing diversion, but just barely. take out ford, and it's not even that.

this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey. sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest.the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on. we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism. here's what's concerning joe gavilan (harrison ford) at the end of the film:1. his real estate deals 2. his affair with a radio psychic 3. he's being investigated by internal affairs 4. the homicide investigationif you add in casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen. the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking.as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. all these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught. we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, i won't. this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting. sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.while this will probably be better than the likes of "the hulk" and "lara croft ii" that still doesn't make this film good. i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, i'm not sure if that's true or not. what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither in its lead roles. my advice to harrison ford would be: to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run.

josh hartnett's dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and harrison ford being in a buddy-cop comedy ! here's 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.the buddy-cop movies are fun. however their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s. making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than (hollywood homicide).what really did happen to this entertaining formula ?! since a whole decade the things hadn't been the same. you'd have a buddy-action stubborn flop after another. i'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : (i spy - 2002), (national security - 2003), (taxi - 2004), (starsky & hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all yet (miami vice - 2006) ! i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during 2 decades already. add to that, particularly here, the negligent dealing and the dull humor. actually the matter this time is totally unbearable. yes, we've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs, and the background of sinful city, but what else was new ?! it's not about cliché; it's about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made.the acting, especially from (hartnett)'s side, is terrible. this guy is anything but a comedian (or actor !). so his character was wanting to revenge for his father's death ! revenge on yourself man, he probably died out of watching your acting !!. even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy (or that's what they seemed here anyhow !).the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh, some parts managed to be highly dull (arresting the black guy through the lack ??) ; it's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action/comedy ! they didn't utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place which's full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could've given it few interesting moments).it's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars' glamour, and as being a buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! guess who ?!), and a buddy-cop destroyer more than movie ! god, don't make me, or my children, live enough to witness (hollywood homicide  part 2) ! at last, look at harrison ford's performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we didn't.

lame movie. completely uninteresting. no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down. the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum. they manage to switch vehicles a few times, but always end up right on the tail of the baddies. the scene where hartnett grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be. he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die, which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty. it just came off as moronic, totally unbelievable and even cruel.some subplots weren't even explored, they were just used as filler. why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes? why, and on what grounds, is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief? why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist? for some reason, even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor, (he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer's house to jack up his own commission), they keep coming back to him anyway! they knew he lied to both of them! yet there they were, coming to terms that both said they would never go for. stupid, just stupid. this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders. there they were, just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover. amazing that they didn't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each....the scriptwriting was terrible, the action sequences were boring, the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett. it fails miserably. and ford's phone! turn the damn thing off! how many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie? 50? 60? it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie! every 30 seconds, that stupid tune would play! and if it wasn't ford's, then hartnett's was ringing! it was incredibly annoying!complete waste of time, ford's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights, which was without a doubt, the lowest point of his distinguished career.

monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory (are there any else in hollywood?) polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish-like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women. james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul-mouthed boss barnes who himself can't keep his hands off of his secretary's rear to get to the bottom (pun intended) of the story. while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america. i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns. there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which, by the way, also supplies the town with jobs for the locals, but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy-feely enviro-marxism. pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex-girlfriend on the beach, tells her that he is seeing the mayor's daughter juanita and it's over between them, then she is promptly eaten that night. a little side action without the evidence. my hat is off to you sir. john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners. you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face. might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn't bounce.supposedly based on a true story, so much so they say it twice in the opening credits, this film is awful on all fronts. filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters, even putting his daughter, andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine. the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming. this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night. the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending. james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed. utterly unwatchable dreck. shame on you john carradine.

hey hulu.com is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name monsteroid, good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie ....have fun with bad movies. anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70's were for horror flicks bad effects, bad dialog, just bad movie making. avoid this unless you want to laugh at it. while you are at hulu check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection.

this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced, written and directed vanity project ...while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me (before the burning at the stake sequence): "this is the worst piece of sh*t i've ever worked on ...and i've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t." also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario (a religious shrine in chimayó) - at which point one of the local "vato loco" low-rider onlookers growled "...show some respect man", which apparently caused jim to remember where he was, as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior. in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer/director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in. like they say: "ya gotta' love the biz..."

i didn't know this was a silent movie with narration. i don't care for silent movies - the corny humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. i'm sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it. it was about chapter 8 before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen. maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd? the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. isabella rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie. no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. i cannot recommend this movie.

when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction. karloff and lugosi both play scientists (rukh and benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. the science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." in that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "radium x" - which can heal and destroy. a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here. lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in africa. the story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. it was ok - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10

a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station. antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and...that's about it. for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.

i've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot. i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera. how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies?? porn movies have better scenarios and effects... i wish i had those 2 hours back...the only good thing about this movie is the cast. even though, their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable, the rest was just way too bad! it's the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight.even worse, i saw a translated version of this flick...imagine, a bad movie...with an even worst translation...yikes!

you believe in god or you don't. you believe in jesus or you don't. you believe he is the son of god or you don't. the choice is up to you.director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary, who opened heaven again for us. encouraging the big bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. the film depicts a theologian bringing some "modern findings" to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play, who happily incorporates them in his play.the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy. more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible.the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life. this is an admirable attempt, but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus.my opinion is not important, god's opinion is, but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne.

well, jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie. the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. but, although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (i am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. why is this movie so incredibly boring? i don't know. it just is and so it is not recommendable.

this film really disappointed me. the acting is atrocious. unbelievable. and it's about actors. the story is incredibly obvious: a group of independent actors stage a passion play and, in turn, they start to live out the lives of the characters they play. i've been watching a lot of movies lately, thanks to netflix, and this is the first one i haven't watched all the way through in a long time. i felt i didn't need to see the end; we all know the end of this story.for some, it seems, this "modernization" of the gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening. i cannot speak to any of this as i wasn't raised in the christian church. that being said, i was raised in the us and i live in an increasingly christian culture. i'm curious enough about jesus and about the modernization of the religion, for better or worse. i haven't seen mel gibson's version, but i'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this, except for the most conservative. i just wish this was a better film.lots of these reviews praise arcand's direction and especially the cinematography. i liked neither. the film itself is rather prudish and preachy. i didn't believe the characters' personae and i was never involved with their on screen lives. the play within the play is very much dated and would not, i think, carry it's own weight in a real time production. but that's beside the point. what i really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about. and the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.there were two examples of this that come easily to mind. firstly, there is a reenactment of the parable of jesus driving the money lenders from the temple: the lead actor, who has fallen for the woman who will play magdalene and who is also a model and dancer, becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial (with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience) with her pants off. he trashes the place and chases them all out. i guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach. the romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high-school rendering of death of a salesman, i.e., not well. please stop hitting me over the head with this high-handed "significance." the other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who, eventually, turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays-corrupt church. why. why does she sleep with this guy. "it brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain." ah, the saintly whore and the lovable old coot. it seems to be just enough for arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters. they are going through the motions and i'm reaching for the eject button.feel free to write me off as bored, jaded or just not interested. feel free to watch this movie and see the passion, in all its beauty, sadness and inspiration, delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade. feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel. but don't say i didn't warn you.

this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham. redgrave's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with thurman's 20 something for the love of fox's character (why is beyond me). the title of the movie should have been "shallow people on the lake". the actors played like they were in a rehearsal. a dreadfully predictable ending to boot. i can't believe this is on this website as a comedy!

ok, the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. first of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. an organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier. though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna, then change your own rna code. explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses? i could see that, but obviously, the writer didn't think of that.

this service comedy, for which peter marshall (joanne dru's brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares) and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin' is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there's one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they're about five feet apart, noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar, there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pair.it isn't enough to save this turkey, alas.

the rookie suffers from so much. there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie, the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush. noonan and leavitt just don't know when to quit. it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped japanese guys. but, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. then it just abruptly ends. even a naked julie newmar in a towel can't save this one.there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long. the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing. stick to martin & lewis. at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face.

it's hard to tell if noonan and marshall are trying to ape abbott & costello, martin & lewis, curley & larry, or some other comedy team, but whoever it was they were trying to imitate, they failed miserably. there's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. noonan (who helped write the alleged "script") and marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; marshall seems to be trying for a dean martin type of devil-may-care coolness, but he doesn't come even remotely close. god knows what noonan thought he was doing, but being funny sure wasn't it. he seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is, but not for the audience. i remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. it was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old jeff chandler western ("pillars of the sky," which was pretty good) and a three stooges short ("sappy bullfighters", which wasn't), and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the three stooges shorts. i stayed around for the end of it (not that i wanted to, but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended), and by the time this mess was over, i was the only one in the theater. i saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night, and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as i remembered. it was worse. the only thing it had going for it was julie newmar, who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her, this thing has absolutely nothing to recommend it. the two of them also play japanese soldiers, and the way they do it makes jerry lewis' infamous playing of japanese characters as thick-lensed, buck-toothed, gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. marshall went on to host "hollywood squares," and noonan kept trying his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad as this. not quite, though, as i don't think anything could be quite as bad as this. a truly pathetic waste of film. don't waste your time on it.

in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.

too many secondary plot lines without a primary one. too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring film, that does not say anything, with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep real love" you would think that it would make for an interesting movie, but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there. boring. not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. pity.oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are quite good. that's what kept me from turning it off. to bad their talents went to waste, the film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. it's just the meaning that's missing.

"kings and queen" is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie. the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live. the other story involves a young man named ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, "kings and queen" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships. it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching. but, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on. even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over. for instance, nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours. nora is admittedly no mother theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father. nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? i don't think so.perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom. but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and co-writer/director arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here. this is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

"rois et reine" is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. it focuses by turns on ex-lovers nora (emanuelle devos)and ismael (mathieu amalric) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. while nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone, ismael's is played mainly for laughs, although it's not particularly funny. nora's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis (maurice garrel), and ismael's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party. ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped nora's life, and in turn have been shaped by her, the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias. as events past and present are played out for the audience, and the ex-lovers become involved in each other's lives once more, it gradually emerges that nora's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here, one which has garnered major plaudits in france. he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone. had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked, but it's not clear in the end what exactly desplechin's film is actually about. heavy-handed allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but, at least for this unschooled movie-goer, remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters. at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne "moon river" as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.**spoiler alert** i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us. this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis' secret diary, but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis' respective relationships with nora. this seems a cheat on desplechin's part, as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative. one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare, but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story. in fact, for all its heavy-handed hints at depth, the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced, as if they function more as ciphers for their creator's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right. much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic. for example, ismael, as we are constantly reminded, is a viola player, but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play, and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated. hence, he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist. amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane ismael, but i found devos cloying and monotone (which may be intentional, however) as the elusive nora. meanwhile jean-paul roussillon as ismael's father, elsa wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and magalie woch as the psychically wounded but defiant sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors. catherine deneuve's in it, too, though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo.ultimately, "rois et reine" is very much an acquired taste. should it fail to push your buttons, it's very likely that desplechin's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching.

i'm sure this was one of those "woah!" attractions in 1982 when epcot opened, but now it's just silly. the film's message is cliché. the circle-vision is disorienting. and that awful song at the end is grating. and i really wish they'd install seats. after so much walking, all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. and when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! you get entertained while sitting down, right? wrong! you're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull, lackluster film. not fun. skip it. in fact, skip canada altogether unless you're eating there. move directly to the united kingdom.

anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal, the author of the novel and screenplay, to air her prejudices, grievances and general antipathy towards the english. the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul.the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, promiscuous, engaging in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor food, and dim-witted -- tellingly, only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be "redeemed" at the end of the film.by contrast, the indian family are beautiful, clever, educated, can speak many languages, are caring and loving parents, and grammar-school fodder. the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all. had it been the other way round, an english family in an indian community depicted this way, the film would have been seen as racist.there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead, i thought it would lodge in my hairline. first, the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration -- undertext: the english are dirty and promiscuous -- and the men -- undertext: english women are prostitutes. second, the meal with anita where neema's family lie to her about cutlery -- undertext: the english are so stupid, you can make them do anything.but the underlying contempt towards anything english -- even english weddings are an object of scorn -- is evident all the way through the film. the character of anita was drawn so appallingly -- almost the fallen woman trope -- that i finished the film feeling angry.this is not a "bend it like beckham" where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community, and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together. instead, anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste, and this is underscored by a thinly-veiled series of attacks upon the film's "other" community: the english.i felt anita and me is a hate-filled, grievance-based piece of work. on that basis, the bbc should not have funded its production.

i had high expectations following "my beautiful laundrette", "bend it like beckham" and (less so) "east is east". the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series (goodness gracious me, etc). this one falls flat. inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a "those were the days" soundtrack, and lots of "issues" in an attempt to be worthy.i found myself cringing at many points during this film. the writing is predictable. every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. in fact, i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren't. the characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy indian parents; the working class neighbour; the 'wise' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. the script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. and why it had to be set in the 70's (apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. i don't know.even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. instead, the usual "bbc comedy" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. "bend it like beckham" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.in summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. give it a miss.

in some ways, the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination. however, no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close-up shots. i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people.the writer appears to have simply lifted clichés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters. the actors did not help matters. no chemistry. i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. however, the writers didn't work very hard to develop the chemistry. sure, they're both attractive, but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.the confidence turner's character shows in sabato's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason. sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules. think of the jeff goldblum character in "independence day." usually, that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance. sabato's character does not. he's cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball. he appears to be right by random chance.the death scenes are comical. every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. the symptoms looked like bad claymation, sort of like that video from the 80s, peter gabriel, i think.

'anita and me' is a drama about growing up in multi-ethnic britain, rather like 'bend it like beckham', or more closely, 'east is east', with which it shares a 1970s setting. the tone is resolutely chirpy (in spite of the dour black country accents), but the film lacks 'east is east's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite. moreover, the portrayal of the film's central relationship, between an asian girl and her white friend, is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it. i have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer, this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story. 'east is east' was fun and sharp; 'anita and me' seems obvious and dull in comparison.

paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable "twist") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another "twist." it's all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)

i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television. i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants. what i didn't remember was how awful it was!!!i recently caught this movie on television late at night. i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again! suzanne somers (at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three's company') plays a vacationer at lakewood manor. constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants' nest. or should i say, a *man-eating ants' nest*!! one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants. one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one, the next minute he's covered in them. the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.if you thought that was pretty far-fetched, you should see myrna loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter! i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!the final scenes depict suzanne, robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered in ants.that's basically the movie. there's really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw to the film. it was intended to be a 'grand-scale' television event at the time. now, it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best, then watch an episode of three's company. if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie.0/10

this is another one of those 'humans vs insects/eco-horror' features; a theme that was popular in the late 70's. only you can't really call it horror. there's zero suspense and no gruesome events. in other words: this movie is pretty lame. it's not that it's really bad or something; it's just very boring. a construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants. later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous. some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on. robert foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours. then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued. and, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them. i won't spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter. all the time when i was watching this, i sat there thinking "come on, people, you all got shoes on. just run out of the building. i'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you." it's all pretty ridiculous.of course, lots of close-ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie. ants in the garden. ants in the garbage. ants in the kitchen. ants on the roof. ants in the bedroom. ants in the sink. and the best part: ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws. but when you see groups of ants in wider shots, they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall.one small surprise came near the end. no, it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot. it was just that brian dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman. ehrr... what more can i say? this movie is called it happened at lakewood manor but the box-art of my copy read ants and the title during the opening credits was panic at lakewood manor. there you have it. now, since this is a made-for-tv movie from the 70's, i'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating. now, the savage bees, another 'humans vs insects' tv-movie from 1976 was much better than this one. i even feel i have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ants. lacking suspense, action, thrills, shocks and creepiness, the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ants is an annoying itch.

a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed. there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible. he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. it has to be a mysterious virus. after the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony. this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.end spoilers overall, this movie is extremely lame. i don't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none. my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film. this is a movie to avoid.

i remember watching this movie when i was young, but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies i find it and think to myself "that is the title?" this movie is a kind of combination disaster film/insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it. it is also somewhat boring too, as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such. the plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants. i think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but do not quote me on that. the most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course summers attack scene too. what else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through. in the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants.

is there a book titled "how to make a movie with every 'man vs. nature' cliché imaginable"? if not, ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. the set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. it's amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie.and can someone please tell me what in god's name myrna loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie? a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies.

even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s, ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending). it is sooooo preposterous. apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal. watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way. so many scenes just look ludicrous: a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked, suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed, robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper, bernie casey faking a gam leg, and the list goes on and on. the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls. the cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. poor myrna loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. i hope she found a good use for the money, for it is obvious that was the only reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. although it is quite a bad film, it is watchable - once for me, and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves, that made-for-tv feel, and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man. this time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected. really quite dreadful.

not only was he invariably annoying to listen to, but he had no jokes. i swear, some fobby asian guy telling yo momma jokes would've been funnier than leary's crap. (well, maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least i'll be able to laugh at least once!) leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes"... apparently he was still high on something; he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related. one of his jokes was something like, 'i wouldn't use crack, especially having the same name as between my ass' - oh man, how did he come up with that one?! i swear the only guy that needs to shut the f**k up is denis leary. thank god i didn't have to see him live. this guy totally sucks.if you're easily amused by swearing, and "jokes" where you can come up with yourself, then waste your time with this junk.

this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top korean movie, i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie trailer...by the way, this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8, even though has no clue what it is about.

i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire, there were numerous political and social messages, the names make refer to some other names etc. it might be. i cannot realize such things (i don't want to do anyway) because i am not interested in, i am interested in 'cinema'. as for the movie itself, again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful. i could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half. yes, that scene says somethings about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. the movie is entertaining (mildly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but no more than that. as for the biggest flaw of the movie, it is visual effects. it was just shocking, i could not pull myself together for a while, because i had expected a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not. it is like if you don't believe that there is a monster, you cannot care about. if you agree with me about this, i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic. the design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. dramatically powerful critique. some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie. yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful. i don't want to compare the host with other monster movies, but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. by the way, may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema. yes, i like asian cinema too, but this is the fact.

monster - he was great; i loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of "the creature from the black lagoon." the scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping.social commentary: much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (under orders from the government) state that sars-like disease is out there. in a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover-up story. you know, i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. in here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this "monster." it just drags the film down. the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.moral: a typical "don't pollute the water" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster. this used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films. now its "environmental issues" that are the focus.the humor this was mostly stupid. i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny. i don't know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old "godzilla" movies. let's hope it's the latter.transfer - the video transfer was good. this was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise. i watched this in korean with the english subtitles. that might have been a mistake as the korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.overall - this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film. two hours was way too long for this story. how this film drew record crowds in korea i don't know. they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support.

the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. her aunt (edna may oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like wheeler--a sentiment i can easily relate to. the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler. they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. at about the same time, woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. so when wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. i have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers! despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood (cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey), i can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. for example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother's film, duck soup, yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. at times, woolsey talked a bit like groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! in fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. his only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. additionally, wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as "who's on first" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. in fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. i knew that "who's on first" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.once again, i have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly (such as silly billies and the rainmakers--which i actually gave 6's to on imdb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey. where was all the humor?!

inept, boring, and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which college student cassie (melissa sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean (casey affleck).i can't begin to tell you how bad this is...nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value. i did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all sadly unconvincing (then again, their roles are no good). to promote this as a horror film is a joke. where are the scares? there's no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs but that's about it.how on earth did this project get the green light? writer-director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense. worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless.the alleged "killer cut" that i watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium.1/10

what's wrong with this film? many, many things. the editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him/her with a powerful headache. the plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short (story or film). the plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film. we all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? exactly. they get thinner. in the end, the plot is just so paper-thin that you might even miss it, if you aren't paying attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. the acting is not even slightly impressive. the characters are poorly written and dull, uninteresting. one of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently, whoever was in charge of the score/soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be about(not that i blame him, i couldn't figure it out either). as a result, half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all. also, what was with all the sexual undertones between eliza dushku and the main character? naturally, this was in order to attract young males, but it was just so cheaply done. and did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? on any conceivable level? at all? the two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all, they were just there in order to have some chase scenes. i doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. but i digress. i recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it(although that may only be true for the killer cut, which i saw). 1/10

having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn, i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead, of all movies. haven't seen that one yet, but, considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever, safe to say i made the wrong choice. there is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. it didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend. it simply made no sense, held no excitement, had very little interesting acting or compelling writing. the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running, and the reason is obvious. the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, to meaningless effect. get wrong turn instead, if you want to see dushku. i would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot elisabeth harnois--but i don't think even that would have made this movie watchable. casey affleck, so promising in good will hunting, is awful here--he seems to lack both intelligence and guts. that's enough on this one.

this film concerns a very young girl, cassie, (melissa sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman. one night cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him. as cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend. cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are, who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal. cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. this is a way out film, and not very good at all.

what a bad, bad movie! i tried watching without fast forwarding...that failed. after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie, went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was. (only 84 minutes, whew!) it was a confusing, boring movie. i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one!! the one funny thing is that i watched "the killer cut" version of the movie. the box boldly states "more blood!" "more sex!" "more terror than the theatrical release!" yikes! if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the "un-killer cut" was??? if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series!!

may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much. i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent. with this said, soul survivors was a very, very bad movie. very bad.i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script. affleck is a very talented actress, wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty, melissa sagemiller did well, and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood. i don't think any of the actors really got into the script, and i understand why. to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. it did have the twists and turns you would expect, but they just didn't lead anywhere... except to more confusion. i just found the ending very anti-climatic, because it just didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline.i wish i could give this movie a good review, but i can't. in all honesty, the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.

i'm just quite disappointed with "soul survivors". it doesn't worth even a comment in this forum. the script is very poor as well as all the "acting" and for our entertainment it features a pointless plot.please, do yourselves a favor! be a real "survivor"...don't waste your time in this piece of crap! someday you'll thank me!

i have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film. while some people walked out of the film, i decided to stay, only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting, lack of suspense, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line. i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film. the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack. this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing. in retrospect, i wouldn't even rent this one, let alone pay more than $5 to see.

...had i watched it in my teenage years. this movie was mildly entertaining. what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes, and the constant flips between 'dream' and 'reality.had there not been movies like 'the 6th sense' and 'don't look now' i would have been surprised by the ending.

steve carpenter cannot make horror movies. first of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer. this movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie), no action, no acting, and no suspense(also a key ingredient). wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. i thought that this movie was rated r, and i didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg-13. anyway, see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer. that's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. and seriously, this is to you steve carpenter, stop making horror movies. this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre.

melissa sagemiller,wes bentley,eliza dushku and casey affleck play young students at middleton college in the town of middleton.the four teenagers form two love triangles.one night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road.not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed.the ghostly nightmare begins...pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity.it's obviously influenced by "carnival of souls".the cinematography is decent,unfortunately there is zero suspense.4 out of 10-just another instantly forgettable teeny-bopper trash.

first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. nothing, and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the entire thing, to which i say..."more power to you"!! i on the other hand just want to be entertained. which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not. this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. seems that most here agree also. most of this didn't make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and....well i guess you see where this is going. avoid, this one sucks....bad!!

i didn't have huge expectations for this film when renting it for $1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its "killer cut" of "more gore! more sex!" can't go wrong there! well... needless to say, the box is a fraud. how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.from there, repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased/killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. add in one tit shot. that is soul survivors.i wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick. if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex.... i want more violence and sex! one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. if this is the killer cut, what is the theatrical cut?! of course, i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place. shame on the actors in this film. i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released. i don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. but what i want to know is.... they really spent $14 million on this film?!

an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track, "soul survivors" is the latest entry in the "who's dead and who's alive" genre of horror films. two teenaged couples, sean and cassie and matt and annabel, prepare to go off to different colleges, but before they part until thanksgiving break, they attend one last fling at a rave-type party in some burnt-out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel (eliza dushku, a.k.a. faith, the other vampire slayer). motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie (the generic melissa sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and before long, the quartet leave the party. driving away in their suv, they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys, who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river. sean is killed (or is he?), and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt (she was driving) when she's not being haunted by sean's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys. much unexplained incoherence follows as cassie's mental state degenerates further, until we reach the predictable conclusion. so, who is dead and who is alive? after ninety minutes of this purgatory, who actually cares?

this is not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker either. it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.my gf and i have figured this movie out (we think) so here it is:***major spoilers below***firstly, this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95% of the movie.)ignoring the junk, what really happened is this: a group of school friends go to a rave one night. they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die. that's the simple cut down version. (that's right, i said sean, bear with me)right after the accident, cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie. this is where the dream part starts.the movie is called soul survivors, right? cassie's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls (annie, matt, raven, the 2 weirdos and jude) along with images conjured up by her mind (sean, school and everything else around her). the souls continue doing what they were defined as: annie the rave-going chick, the 2 weirdo-killers (from opening scene), father jude still helping people etc.we are then taken on a very long ride, shown lots of images (many of which my gf and i still can't tie in) but it all boils down to it not being cassie's time to die.at the end, cassie wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. her family and sean are there. this is reality again. she's ok.then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled. but this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up beside sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience.due to space restrictions, we didn't cover every little thing, but feel free to drop us an e-mail if you want to.

i wanted to watch this movie because of eliza dushku, but she only has a smaller part in it, and her character isn't very likable. however, the main character, played by melissa sagemiller, is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie. this is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. she does a very good job.the story itself is, on the face of it, pretty nonsensical. after a car crash, some friends are possibly dead, but keeps on living their previous lives, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. some bad guys are after them, but we never really find out who they are (possibly they were the ones in the other car, but we certainly don't hear anything about why they are after them). the final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious, but i can't get anything coherent out of it. the opening scene, where the bad guys (who wear some strange masks) cut a blond girl's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on. unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who're trying to pull cassie (sagemiller) back from the dead... but no, that doesn't seem to work. the bad guys are just bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting. in a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who the hell needs bad guys?3 out of 10.

(a possible spoiler or two)  "soul survivors" is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever. nothing makes sense at all, there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together, by the end of the film.  tha acting is non-existent, the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even harder to watch. i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came. definitely the worst film of the year. -****1/2 stars.

if the writer/director is reading this (and i imagine you are since you should now be out of work) then i must tell you - i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever heard.spoilers - nothing happens! a total waste of time. i laughed out loud at the end. side note - (if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?)utter rubbish.

like a relative that gives you a bad gift, soul survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution. stephen carpenter's writing/directing effort borrows freely from other, better films, such as jacob's ladder and abre los ojos (open your eyes). for those who haven't seen either of these films, i won't give the premise away; suffice to say it's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films.melissa sagemiller stars as cassie, about to go away to college. her current boyfriend sean (ben affleck) and ex-boyfriend matt (wes bentley), both friends, and annabel (acerbic eliza dushku) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers (?) in transparent masks. she survives the wreck, but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? who's alive? what's real?soul survivors has the look of a bad been-there, done-that, gore-filled, blood-splattered, body-stacking teen exploitation flick. true, it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (plentiful, repetitive, and mind-numbing), but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches, unfortunately rather unsuccessfully. it breeds confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes jumbled, messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery (predictable as it is.)horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count. credit goes to carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick; too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller. sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling cassie. it's great the filmmakers try something different, but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment.4 out of 10

final score: 1.8 (out of 10)after seeing 'jay and silent bob strike back' i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie. 'soul survivors' is a junk "psychological thriller" dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like dushku, wes bentley (american beauty), casey affleck (drowning mona) and likable star melissa sagemiller. luke wilson is also in there, ridiculously miscast as a priest. the movie, the brainchild of writer/director stephen carpenter, seems like a mutant offspring of 'open your eyes' or 'vanilla sky' and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. i don't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with, but 'ss' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. the visuals, the script, the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. plus, it's pg-13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t&a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). i had heard that the movie contained some "hot" shower scene between dushku & sagemiller. as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least i would get something out of this. then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. that's it. people thought this was hot? 'soul survivors' is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it. it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. in the end it leaves us empty. carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part. it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci-fi channel, due to it's low cost and pg-13 rating - and that's probably best for it.

this su*k! why do they have to make movies that they must know su*k from the beginning? i mean, look at alien from 1977. if the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before, why make it? i had problems with the plot and who the main character was. that's not good either.

i saw this movie a long time ago... luckily it was for free. i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. i don't remember a whole bunch of it, but i do remember i was incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was. i just was incredibly bothered by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? how stupid do they think we are?

the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart: yes, it's solar crisis, aka crisis 2050, which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one alan smithee. the plot hook's pretty much the same as sunshine - suicide mission to the sun, saboteur on board, logic cast adrift - except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth. with a talking bomb. voiced by paul williams. who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most dementedly ott, charlton heston at his most rigid, top-liner tim matheson at his most anonymous, the original hills have eyes' unforgettable michael berryman (you may not remember the name, but you do remember that face) and peter boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because, er, if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down, you'd expect if not a laugh-a-minute at least a laugh every reel. no joy. this is the worst kind of bad movie: a boring one. the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace. there's low-key and there's walking through it, but here the cast don't even do that. instead, they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time. you keep on hoping for paul williams' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis, but instead the film just... stands there, doing next to nothing. literally. this is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if clive owen had been cast, he'd almost have looked lively by comparison. even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves, yep, the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness. even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world. merchant-ivory films have better action scenes.things aren't much livelier down on earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with matheson's son/chuck's grandson corin nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with palance's insane desert artist "looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me" while waylaid by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach. just don't expect logic, if you haven't already guessed that much. best moment? a ditzy girl in a bar describing jack palance as "an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather," though chucky baby taking out the villain's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin'. richard c. sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of vanishing point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film. a film so bad it's not good, and painfully unfunny with it

yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.boring direction and performances (with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the ever earnest charlton heston) earn the rating of a real stinker.it's amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is. he even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie. the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't. it simply falls off the end.really. don't waste your time on this one.

i had high hopes for this film, since it has charlton heston and jack palance. but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so. palance was ridiculous. not even heston's acting or annabel schofield's beauty (or brief nude scenes) could save this film. some of the space effects were quite good, but others were cheesy. the plot was ludicrous. even sci-fi fans should skip this one. grade f

okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say. to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' santa clause? is it some sort of corporation? a little explanation would of been lovely. second: the movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care. third: i suppose this was suppose to be a family film? its rating was low at just pg. for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. it didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem. through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against vaughn, he's been good in other movies)so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick. in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental.

how hard is it to write a watchable film with vince vaughn, paul giamatti and kevin spacey? apparently very difficult for the writers here.i still have no idea how santa is younger and looks 20 years older than vince (who plays the big brother). i must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of "funny notion" scenes that are drug out way too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.the director/producer tried to go "tear jerker" at the end, which would have been suitable if anything leading up that point had been worth following.ugh, major disappointment. i can see how some people might enjoy this ok, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but i would strongly encourage waiting for dvd on this one. not worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.

every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life. i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa. so sue me. i admit it. i like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. i like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of santa in all his guises, from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton? fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls, but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. "fred" is a perfectly ok holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. my wife and i laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince. paul giamatti was a top-notch santa, which helped a lot. not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions. but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. there's nothing wrong with that.

painfully bad christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by vince vaughn, who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his r rated films. vaughn seems like he's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance. after 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say "bahumbag" at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. out of all the actors involved in this mess, only paul giamatti and rachel weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. paul giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of saint nick himself but he's forced to vaughn's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. you can see in giamatti face that he's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. rachel weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she's well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. fortunately for her, she's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike giamatti, who looks like he's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. the direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.i don't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved (giamatti and weisz) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a christmas movie of all things) and a actor who just does not care about his performance (vaughn), you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch.

i just saw this film tonight and i have to say that it's a mess. i love vince vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic " santa claus the movie" but with out the camp or the bad sheena easton song at the end. .the story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with north pole as its setting. of course fred (vince vaughn) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend (rachel weisz in a cameo role) dumping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother santa claus (paul giamatti) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of christmas. now if you think you know the ending of this film, i think you would be right because it's predicable to the hill. as for the acting, vince vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable, miranda richardson plays mrs. claus but the role is more than less one note, elizabeth banks plays santa's assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film "glengarry glen ross" but a little more anal. the only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is paul giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as santa claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and rachel weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs, which is a shame because both rachel weisz and paul giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.to put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment.

alien hunter: 5 out of 10: is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell, new mexico suck. take alien mixed with the thing, mixed with contact, mixed with of all things on the beach, the andromeda strain, the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot. derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. aggh!) in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. i mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke.with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif. (note that since jason of friday the 13th fame, pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) the characters in the cornfield dress like logan's run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear. john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie.

i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing, final fantasy, the abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless. moreover there is nothing to watch - the fx'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. but it is definitely a good lullaby.

this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. there were a couple of sub-plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end... but they didn't. if you want a "alien in the frozen waste" story, stick with the 1950's version of the thing (not the abomination that was remade in gore-o-vision 20+ years later).i couldn't get over the fact that the "alien" looked pretty much recycled from independence day. the "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood.lots of scenery chewing with little payoff.

snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station, as you toss this into the waste disposal unit. spend a useful 90 min. living your favourite game. disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk. it takes a bits from several other "science fiction" movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story. there's nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game, but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film. any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally i would like my 90 min of life back.

is it a remake og the thing (1982/1951), i think it is, there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.so the acting is bad, james spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other actors i did't even notise. you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. and the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. score/music is ultraboring, imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. if you like slimy aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the thing, alien 3, outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer/michael bay production gone really really bad. now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing, and the only ones on this production that knew that was, no one.though i have seen far worse, i would not recomend this movie to anyone, but if you are up one cold night, and just wanna glanse at something, it will pass the time, slowly.

begins better than it ends. funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. it's like those scenes where documentary shots...--- spoiler part ---- the message dechifered was contrary to the whole story. it just does not mesh.

an unoriginal, overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci-fi formula that we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something, and in of all places (surprise, surprise) antarctica!the film features james spader and an almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of carl lewis, who's actually not that bad for a non-actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances that do little to invigorate the script's unimaginative dialogue. to make things worse the film's pace is slow, there's almost no subplot, and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting. its little wonder that this thing went straight to dvd. what is a wonder is why spader - an excellent actor at times, who won the cannes best actor award for `sex, lies and videotape', and did a splendid job in the innovative sci-fi flick `stargate' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project. or maybe not, if you look at his career, for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.the most remarkable thing about `alien hunter' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci-fi films, and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived. there are huge borrowed bits from `the thing' (both howard hawks' original and john carpenter's excellent 1982 remake), `contact' and `outbreak'; a few hints of `alien', ce3k', `the andromeda strain', `kubrick's `2001' (i.e. the `alien black box') and `mission to mars' (i.e. the mystery message); and even a little dash of `sneakers' and `a remarkable mind' (although not sci-fi films, they share a `cryptology' connection). hell, there's even cornfields and antarctica, just like the recent `x files movie'. and the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from `the abyss'.its all been done before and done a whole lot better, although i will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end. i could say a little bit more about the plot, but there's absolutely no need. you already know over half this movie without ever seeing it. (5 out of 10)

very bad acting, and a very shallow story. not even a decent b-movieevents that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.this is one of the worst sci-fi i've ever seen. i saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, but it sucked so bad.now there's really very few good movies on alien subject, i think because most of them are low budgeti give it 3/10

with one of my very favorite actors, james spader, i expected this film to be at least tolerable. it wasn't. after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. so trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. one can even predict the dialogue word for word. this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, "how did this movie ever get made?" in an effort to say something positive, i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. but, on the whole, if you've seen 5 sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.

recap: something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica. the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica. julian rome, a former seti-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. soon the object is in the open. the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. it is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, julian decodes the signal. "do not open". but too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. the first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. and washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. so a russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica.comments: the movie holds a few surprises. one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. it is never really explained why washington know so much, why washington is able to command russian submarines, why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now. it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english. some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose english, why?). but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus, send their "do not open" message encoded! and finally the end is as open as an end can be.the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.3/10

"hey everybody! i've got an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space so why don't we thaw it out and open it up?" "yes, i know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race, but hey, i want to know what's in it". "and nobody tell nasa, they might take it away from us". "wow this thingie gives off vibes!" "yes,really strong ones on contact so don't touch it but it's okay to cut it open". "hi there handsome, check out my nips". (later that day); "do not open"!!!!! uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we don't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here. "i've never seen such organic technology!" "yeah, lemme take this stick and stab it.". "i'm getting out of here, i don't care if i do kill the other 6 billion people on earth, nobody's nukkin' me!" "look! it's the friendly aliens from "the abyss"! they want us to come with them". the end

the acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. brad pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious austrian climber quite well. other acting is fine. the story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but i could not, try as i might, involve myself in this story. as an unabashed brad pitt fan (i consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), i expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.it could be a failing within myself, but i tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. it's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. it wasn't. probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much, and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as i was. mostly, it bored me.

ok, here it is: "nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama." what we do is, first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent, and we let him flounder around between french, german, american, and british for over 2 hours. then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely, so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly. but just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep, we throw in details which are shockingly absurd, such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet. naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles, so we have every character, even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of lhasa in 1943, speak perfect english, also with dubious accents. of course, the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is this: we have the dalai lama befriend the now-reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors, radios, antique cars, and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west. in return, our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague, undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion. we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama, even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader. in other words, we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist, sort of, in his own way, even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go. and last but not least, we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans (which is certainly true), thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a "political" movie, even though it is nothing of the sort. so, zat ist my idea. vat do you zink? can ve make zis movie?

i read the book "7 years in tibet" from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how wrong it all was told:when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet, so they greet back... in the book harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book harrer mentions, that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young dalai lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young "living buddha"?? childish... and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was ok for me because "7 years in tibet" is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. i'm very disappointed by this "adaption" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.

i've read all the comments on this film. i am a great admirerof the dalai lama. as such, i read the book upon which thisfilm was based. the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. i do not criticize it foraltering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it isnot a documentary. but the script changes the impact, reaction,realities, and changes in every main character. it vastly altersthe real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama. from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman (which demeansthe culture of tibet) to harra's music box gift, to harrar'schange of heart, everything about this movie is false - exceptfor the amazing photography. i understand that the shots of thepotala (the palace) were smuggled out of tibet. however,changing a real story about the relationship between two people,one of them very important to this world, in order to build up amovie star is sad

i can't believe it, imdb really does have every tv show known to man! i have not seen this show in over 20 years. i only remember two episodes, and i barely remember those. i remember that tony may not been on from the start, because one of the episodes i remember is the one in which everybody trying to get tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of power house, with everybody cheering.the other one i remember is the one where lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners). i don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.this is one of those shows that i convinced myself that i must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it.

this doesn't quite plumb the depths of creepshow 3, but it comes close. it also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is distracting to say the least.it also rather irritating rips off the twilight zone (with the bookshop being comparable to serling's later night gallery). unfortunately, the producers & writers forgot that serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over. none of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.framing story: adam west is... well, himself. he doesn't go the bruce wayne/batman campy 60s route, but he rarely does. he simply plays the not-particularly-enigmatic "jay" (there's an ominous spine-chilling name to compare to the likes of dr. terror, eramus, and the cryptkeeper), and makes some mildly awkward/creepy statements.abernathy: seen rod serling's "a stop in willoughby"? then you've seen this. the red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a wimp. as well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent.nex's diner: reminiscent of various serling time travel stories, mixed with steve allen's "a meeting of minds." most of the actors aren't too bad (except for josh astin as cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is mildly interesting. but like abernathy, it doesn't go anywhere. the main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out a bit (who wouldn't?), and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.life replay: not a bad little piece, and manages to predate both click and creepshow 3. i suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls. the main character is mildly sympathetic. nothing substantially innovative here, but it's okay.fighting spirit: you see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption.finale: so... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits? don't know. and doesn't make sense. so... all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped? kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), and the guy in the first segment died. so how did he get trapped? did he visit the bookstore before he died, got trapped and... didn't die? what? huh? i supposer this isn't expected to make sense because it's supernatural. but still...overall: basically not dissimilar from the two newer twilight zone series, or some episodes of tales from the darkside or monsters. the last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. but there's nothing really spectacular here.

i actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. no doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job. the actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film, it certainly was not. besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. the one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. to bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.i'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. i only watched it because of some good comments posted here. they must have been planted by people with ties to the film. you may fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them into liking what they saw.i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming. sure it failed miserably, but it tried. i reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. i wish i had.

and maybe, as fred sandford used to say, "one across the lips". that to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public. and perhaps to the person in "rue morgue" who called this a "fender hellbender" and said it was good.five young girls, apparently taking a short-cut home from a high school football game, become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere. while there the driver accidentally hits a parked suv & knocks out a headlight, but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver. but the driver does come to find them, and it's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged, it's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. when the driver does first catch them she (yes, it's a she) brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down, and keeps screaming at them, "how much did you see?". of course the girls are scared to death & don't know what she's talking about.as the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the suv, who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls, who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they didn't want them. eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman's psychotic rage. and eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.there are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary, but unfortunately, those moments are undermined by bad acting, bad dialog, and huge lapses of credibility. one girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded, and she's feeling cold, her life is passing before her eyes, but she got better? and how far can a mini-van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour? i need one of those things, it apparently gets great mileage.there should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge, but the film goes on for a bit after that, which is an anti-climax, but they at least learn some of what set the woman off, and the driver is still worried about "messing up her mom's van", which is obviously the least of anyone's worries.so this isn't the worst film i've seen, but it's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible. but it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this. which, by the way, i don't necessarily recommend. 4 out of 10.

five across the eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew, they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it. soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them, makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off. shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas...produced & directed by greg swinson & ryan theissen with swinson writing the thing & theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing i have to say that five across the eyes is easily one of the worst films i have ever seen if not the worst, i mean i'm struggling to think of a film i have seen that's worse. now let me start off by saying that i am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere, tension, realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of five across the eyes that i didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on youtube & even then it's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that i could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers. the reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the imdb (the amount of 1 star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong, right?) & it's message board which i think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase 'the worst film i have ever seen' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & i have to agree with them. the story is terrible, alright i suspect it's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal? there's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random. it goes on for ages, the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature. the dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot. oh god the screaming, there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly. then there's the real killer, the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van, seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring, add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & five across the eyes is a film that i hated with a passion.on a technical level again i can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but i have to be honest again & say five across the eyes is the worst looking film i have ever seen. as a fan of film i like my films to look like proper films as it's a visual medium & i definitely don't want them to look worse than the average youtube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while i was drunk. it really does look that amateurish & that bad, it's a complete eyesore & i hated every moment of every second of it. just think the blair witch project (1999) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there. there are times during five across the eyes when you literally can't tell what's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels. the violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.low budget doesn't even begin to describe five across the eyes, with a supposed budget of about $4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release. the two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that's basically pretty much the entire budget right there, the locations. the acting is pretty bad by the main cast, i just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely.five across the eyes will go down as one of the worst films i have ever seen & i have seen a few films, whenever anyone now ask's me what's the worst film i have ever seen five across the eyes will definitely get a mention. i hated it, every single aspect & wretched moment of it.

i never finished this movie for a reason, it was dreadful and thats just the acting. i wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful. i mean ususally i like some nude in a film (lol) but it was just sick because of what was happening. all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities. this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it. (n)

im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.

less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful. all this "horror" movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it.the movies plot had potential to be something great, but it just doesn't happen. a group of five "teenage" girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them. two minutes into the movie, and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop. all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing. none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too, so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them.the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers. none of these women looked a day under 20, and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old. at least get people who look the age. none of them gave even remotely decent performances, and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities. the "actress" who played the killer overdone it, but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't - a little bit of talent.the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny, stupid bitches. that is all i can really say about them, and it did not help that they all survived. if i have to go into detail, in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot. one girl injures herself and is whining about it...four of them aren't wearing seat-belts...what do you expect? one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer...and you all just happen to be conveniently "too hurt" to help? whatever.the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible. i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut, the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie. the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out, shook and brushed up against an "actress" was horrendous. it was also grainy, and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying (not that it was anything worth listening to).supposedly the killers car in the movie (that supposedly got hit, even though we only heard the accident) is actually the directors car in real life. no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit! this movie is so cheap, they can't even show a car getting a little scratched up. oh, gotta mention the soundtrack also...if that's what it was. it was horrid...sad one second, then hard rock the next. at the end of the day, five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home-movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes. it doesn't help when the script is terrible, the scares/tension/suspense and (hardly even any gore to make up for it) are absent, the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous.this was a horrible low-budget movie. avoid it at all costs.1/10

this "film" attempts to follow the genre of low budget, hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.this one, fails, and how.it's amazing how many so called "awards" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this....words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is. seriously, it's that bad.i watched it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continual fast forward.from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing, grainy visuals to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting, this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making.it seriously, has no redeeming qualities - whatsoever. save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there - dead end, the blair witch, rec, to name but a few.avoid this rubbish at all costs. do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.take heed of all the other comments! you've been warned!

um... okay, i guess i get the whole shaky-cam, gorilla-style filming technique but unfortunately i think a gorilla could have made a better movie... this thing was just a complete mess from the get go. bad acting, bad directing, bad story and horrific cinematography. how this piece of garbage was released i will never know, but it has and unfortunately i watched it. filmed on location in tennessee by the directing team of greg swinson and ryan thiessen (harry and lloyd), "five across the eyes" i'm assuming is supposed to resemble a "blair witch" type film but falls short... okay it nose dives off a cliff. i was actually embarrassed for these young women, whom i'm sure were promised hollywood stardom, but ended up in this dung heap. the dialog is ridiculous, and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. how this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery, as there is nothing even remotely scary about it, except for the fact that i watched it... try this one on for size: there is 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat her ass... "the end". saddly it went on (and on) for 95 more minutes of mind-numbing stupidity...i saw it for free, and wanted my money back.

what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe. that doesn't rule it out however; get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter. great wasted night stuff. al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???). but how clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality (grange hill) or soon to go on to poor quality drama (eastenders) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable. are we really to believe that the icf (on whom of course the drama is based) would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokes?the icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds. andy nicholls' scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- oldman is so camp it is unbelievable. most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey. a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it.

i'm sorry, but this is such a bad movie it's hilarious. football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge? suits? shades?! alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this, it is as far from the truth as you can get.the casting was atrocious...gary oldman as a football hooligan? he doesn't look scary, act scary or even come across as someone who would like football. and as for yeti? what the hell? suits, shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with "its about time you got your nappy on". please.and the yeti's gang spraying the icc's underwear? i don't see how anyone can even take this film seriously!.4/10. its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen.

i heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good. but i started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested. this could be a really great, darkly black satire on todays morals in media. the small featurettes on every contestent were good. it build up to something i wouldn't wanna miss. but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. but instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.the ending is so bad i give it a 1. even if the film starts of promising.

alan rudolph is a so-so director, without that special touch. as an example, there was one shot in the secret lives of dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife. rudolph squandered it. the camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices, with dana and dave each alone in their respective rooms. you get the idea of their desolation and isolation, but not much more. the lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon. if i were directing, i would have spent all day, if necessary, to get that shot right. that's the beauty and power of film: it can express so much, whole lives, in a matter of secondsthe shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on. the child should have shown more fascination with the puddle, should have stomped and shuffled her feet, should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention. campbell didn't deliver. he plays a uncommunicative man, true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played by denis leary.

an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. so, no new story lines here. however, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. if you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife's teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film. if not, move on to something else (my fair lady, anyone?)

it's common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone. there's a difference, however, between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members. in "the secret lives of dentists," starring campbell scott and hope davis, director alan rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible, with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life.scott gives a fine performance in the role of david hurst, a dentist married to another dentist (davis). rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly - he is completely absorbed in the day-to-day duties of being the parenthood, she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life - and then ratchets up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man. from this point on, the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery, or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good. from time to time, david is treated to visits from an imaginary "friend" in the form of a former patient played by denis leary (borrowing heavily from brad pitt's tyler durden in "fight club").while there is enough uncertainty about dana's infidelity and david's instability to warrant examination, the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative. instead, rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the hurst family, culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film's climax. the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn't so dedicated to his family; neither does it spend much time looking at dana's precarious balancing act between her family life and her other, more fulfilling ambitions.by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry, rudolph kills the momentum of his film. by the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly, the film has used up all the good graces of scott's well-measured performance. david and dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale. with nothing to build on over the last hour, the conclusion seems awkward and patched-on. "the secret lives of dentists" takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it. altogether, a disappointing, unimaginative film.

i really don't understand all these positive user reviews. this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be pessimistic.eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film. but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors. he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.the star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.don't watch this bullshit, go watch a fellini, woody allen or some david lynch.

live! yes, but not kicking.true story: some time ago, a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show. a contest rather. the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure. for real.the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd, saying it was appalling, immoral, what-is-this-world-coming-to, and the like. in a way, i had to agree.as the months passed, the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country.the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead. and up to the last moment the country was up in arms, the prime minister making speeches, every newspaper writing about it, everyone in the country holding their breaths. and the network pushed on. towards a new frontier in television. and they definitely succeeded in doing just that. they pushed the envelope.the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live, whilst she would die shortly after.and then, in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. the woman was not ill, but all the candidates were. there was no kidney auction. the whole show, that, with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions, built up for months to a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors. the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease.now this is television. leaving everybody far behind in amazement.don't give me a poorly acted, poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv.as if.*spoiler* as if i'm going to believe they would get this through the fcc. as if i'm going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression. as if i'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air.it's all been done before. watch running man with arnold instead. at least it had a semi good ending.*spoiler* this is an appallingly bad piece of film, together with a ridiculous ending. so she gets shot in the end, is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? don't take my word for it, but i would say this: leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead, you'll get more quality.

i give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. but i couldn't get past the implausibility of the whole thing.first and foremost, a game built around the notion of "russian roulette" that has to fill on hour. the big problem is that if you are doing a "live" show, you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the "real" bullet. then what do you do? you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show. the corollary is that okay, you get to the end and the first five contestants survive, which means number six has the bullet and can't possibly get the payout. he isn't going to shoot himself at that point, so it's kind of anti-climatic. second problem, almost as big. human nature. people are going to flinch, panic, soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television. too much randomness. that's why "real" reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited.(the only random thing is the "performance artist's" rant about female sacrifices, which were actually rare historically. even that was predictable, since she went through with shooting herself to no effect.) we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning (unlikely) with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings.a point on race and sex. big surprise the movies two minority (one gay) and two female contestants are the ones who survive. so we are left with the two white males, and of course, the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it. the purpose of such a show would be it's randomness, but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies.the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide, the eva mendes character (mendes produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself) actually grows a conscience when someone dies. what did she think was going to happen? she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing (motives never explained) and the show went on to be a big hit. really? the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous (like network). this is neither.

there really wasn't much of a story in this film. it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie. it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness. but there isn't much more than that.it mixes some scenes from the original, then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit. but still, is that it? i was hoping for something a little more. instead, all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe, then this is it. but other than that, it does little justice for the animators. disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions. it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham. "d-"

i found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a "new perspective" is an all-time low...soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a "new version of the movie we all love." nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again. timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original "lion king" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened...as they see it.of course timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember matthew broderick, whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance? overall if you liked the original you'll hate this. it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike. and that about sums it up.

having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly. i thought lion king 1.5 might be worth watching. what a disappointment ! disney must be getting desperate for revenues.especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make aquick buck. unlike lk i & ii, both of which had strong story lines.this movie hardly has a story at all. while the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.disney - shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work.

a dedicated fan to the tlk movies, with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced, along comes this film... now i'm not arguing with animation, voice work, music, but this is no more than a timon/pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere. although it isn't bad, it doesn't add anything. basically this movie is one big joke... and that's about all that saves it. make a real tlk3, disney! the potential is there.4/10

this is one really bad movie. i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make. the acting is atrocious. i've seen more believable performances on cable access. the plot is ridiculous. stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the president, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst. night of the sharks isn't even so bad it's good. the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed. and to top it off, night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard. i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record.from everything i've read, the italian film industry was dead by 1987. night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin.

i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because i think "the wild women of wongo" is worse. this is an exercise in patience. it's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. there's no plot. there's no logic. there is certainly no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). we don't wonder about anything. we don't know how people got where they got. it's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. i agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. i know. it's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection. it's like a paperweight. or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. it covers the crack in the wall.

i saw and liked the first two a lot, really. especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. and it's a story standing alone. you don't have to know the first movie. i liked that in the "free willy" movies, too.but... the third, here is absolutely useless! i tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. we decided to stop after a good half an hour. the movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. but what for? timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. but what for? i'd really like to know. you know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. but what comes after is mostly unnecessary. i guess many people liked timon and pumba, and so do i really. yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. no chance, most of it wasn't funny at all, at least for me. btw. what was the movie about anyway? was it a) about timon and pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it.if you like to see stories like: "the story behind xy", you should see "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman. that's really funny and no try to get more out of "hamlet" then it has.

[contains spoilers!!!] timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king. timon decides to go back before the beginning, to when the story really began. so they go back. way back. back even before simba was born. back to timon's old home which was miles away from pride rock. a clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. the worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named timon. his mother took pity on him but uncle max just shook his head. mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty; timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. just then, hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max. that did it. the other meerkats just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave. so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. he didn't get very far before he started getting homesick. just then he met rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. timon and pumbaa join up then, but timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends. they soon arrive at pride rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffe's, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. what was going on? timon didn't care. they pressed on. timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see. just then all the animals took a bow. was this to honor the birth of the new king? no, pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. when they reach land, timon decides to give up. but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. it was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from rafiki: hakuna matata. timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into simba. they take him under their wing and become father figures. they teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. pretty soon, a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest. simba won, leaving timon deathly ill. then one day, simba's childhood friend nala arrived. timon and pumbaa just knew she'd break up the friendship. suddenly, simba runs away. nala and pumbaa race after him, but not timon. he chose to stay at "hakuna matata" by himself, until rafiki "talked" some sense into him, so he joins his friends at pride rock. timon's mother and uncle max arrive then. while simba battles scar, mother and max dig a large hole to trap hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed in. it worked. scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. then all is well. mother, uncle max and the rest of the meerkats go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is hakuna matata. back to the present, timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother, uncle max, simba and rafiki want to watch it again. so do mickey mouse, donald duck, goofy, snow white, the seven dwarfs, dumbo, peter pan, the lost boys, mad hatter, march hare, genie, aladdin, and jasmine. well, i must say that the lion king 1 1/2 wasn't as good as i had hoped. it was too ridiculous and silly. the original lion king was a masterpiece. it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. this one was just silly and made a mockery of it. i swear, sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed. they're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. the original voice cast is back: nathan lane as timon, ernie sabella as pumbaa, matthew broddrick as adult simba, whoopi goldberg as shenzi, cheech marin as bonzai, jim cummings as ed, robert guillame as rafiki. new to the cast are julie kavner of tv's (too) long running series the simpsons as timon's mom and jerry stiller as uncle max. so anyway, this movie isn't the lion king iii, and it isn't ii because there already is a ii. it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away. hence, it's 1 1/2. in conclusion, i don't recommend this to die hard lion king fans because it's far too ridiculous and frivilous. however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them. i hope this will also be the last lion king movie. two is enough. "the lion king 1 1/2". what we've come to expect from disney sequel makers.-

the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid. at least all i lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location, mr. fbi handed the female a revolver. when the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian? i think not. ms. xavier appears to be a very attractive female. it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen. it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.

i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made .i too had to fast forward through most of this movie. michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone.the picture quality is grainy all the way through .and what little plot there is,is just plain stupid .i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would .don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it.

i just watched this film 15 minutes ago, and i still have no idea what i just watched. mainly i think it's a film about an internet s&m "star" of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. she's murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death. the local homicide division of big city, usa is also investigating, though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic "as the real thing". i know. wow.michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him. he's in the film for about 15 minutes, and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. i won't even explain the ending, because quite frankly i can't make it out myself. but before the final scene, we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. honestly, they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.all in all, stay away from this film. i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen. i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. like, playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.

this is not michael madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. this movie was just awful. if you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. words cannot describe how idiotic it is. sorry michael. the cinematography was dark. all the other actors are unknowns. when watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. this movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground s & m killer. the acting was bad, except michael madsen's parts. he looked like he wanted to laugh. i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. it is something i would not be proud of. it is not even a b movie for cable, it is more like a f and it should never be shown, ever.

a bdsm "sub-culture" of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess, plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player, celia xavier, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia. a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer. celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd-roms, but when disaster befalls "mistress vanessa", virtuous celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a "dungeon party". two fbi field agents (whose deployment to the vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet bdsm sites), in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to l.a.p.d.'s operations-south bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction. the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario. one solid acting turn appears among this slag: stan abe as a zealous fbi agent.

this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i havehave ever encountered in an american film. the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died. i was so disappointed at joemantegna calling a bunch of men ,sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons ,heros that common sense prevailed and i stopped. i am deeplydisturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and "different". i suggest that mr. mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same.

very disappointing film. by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters. i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part, and william macy was good as always, still not worth watching. it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker. insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep.

david mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. his first movie 'house of games' was the one i liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.so is 'homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. the principal characters are two cops, one jewish and one irish who deal with a racially charged area. the murder of an old jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the israeli independence war triggers the jewish identity in the mind and heart of the jewish detective.this is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. the process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. the end of the film itself is mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.joe mantegna and william macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.

as a big fan of david mamet's films and plays, especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna, i was expecting great things from this film. instead, i found myself annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them, in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized. identity is totally reevaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. because of his oaths taken as a cop, the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives, and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal, but then still refuses the minor action. in addition, a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting, and the cop's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet, i was extremely disappointed to say the least. 3 out of 10.

i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all, but just barely. it's sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd, exposing people who may not be too familiar with l&h to their worst stuff rather than their classic comedies.once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who's invented an invisible ray. he's in love with the bosses' daughter, who hates him and prefers some slick guy. it's incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what l&h needed in their films.without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old. the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum, being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy "insurance" on stan.otherwise, this script is just a mess. forget this and see if you can find a copy of "a chump at oxford" or "bohemian girl" or "sons of the desert" instead.

i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel & hardy's. for me, it isn't as close to as bad as "air raid wardens" and "the bullfighters", but there are some definite huge flaws in it. the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio. hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a "london bridge" dance, surrounded by 20th century fox starlets, while in the next room, laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit. a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor, leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser. then, in come the racketeers, now selling insurance covering up their protection racket. one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum. but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance, they are arrested.this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio. the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy's support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend, robert bailey. they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents (matt briggs and margaret dumont) and hopeful suitor allan lane, whom we can tell right off is a no-good swine. this leads to briggs' hidden bar being revealed to tea-totaling dumont, and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below. when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun, pandemonium ensues. the dead-pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire.later, hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so. there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid. (even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman, after being arrested, their licenses would have been revoked). laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog (only a frosting covered, cake devouring toto look-alike, or possibly the actual pooch), causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller-coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on, perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks. roller-coaster gags can be exciting, as evidenced in "abbott and costello go to hollywood", and this one is amusing but anticlimactic.as the story wraps up, all of these gags seem to have no point, giving the impression that this was simply a series of one-reelers put together to make a full-length feature, hopefully part of a double bill. l&h, as i've mentioned in other reviews of their later films, had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach's employ, but surprisingly here, they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year. had the gags not been as amusing, as was the case with some of their other films, this surely would have ranked a "2" as opposed to a "3".

this has to be the worst movie i have seen. madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was. he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes. this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t.v. had been destroyed.

for those fans of laurel and hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team. their contracts with hal roach studios had expired and now they were "free agents"--able to work for any studio who offered them a job. unfortunately, fox, rko, mgm (without roach) and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents. plus, stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny. stan looked very ragged and ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk--and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics.in addition to their age, this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple--something that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid "hangers on" instead of just being themselves. a cute and cuddly stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the 20s and 30s--and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.now even with their age, this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared--and it's quite obvious they were using the "b unit" here--with, at best, second class support. in particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful--relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene--which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.for mind-numbed zombie lovers of laurel and hardy, it's probably a film they will love. but, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed. in fact, of all their full-length films pre-1940, i can't think of one i liked less than dancing masters. unfortunately, of the post-1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones. sadly, it got a lot worse--with wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble. i just wish the boys had just retired after saps at sea.finally, i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the reviewers' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film? for an audience who are not already in love with the team, i don't know how this film will do anything but bore the audience--it certainly won't convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses. but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.

this movie was long and boring. surprising that it was selected for cannes, although they tend to like pretentiousness. point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop, guernsey feels utterly empty. even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever. a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all. the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times. leopold tried, but she is not the talent i hoped she would be. where are kerkhof and kruishoop? they really made some waves in dutch cinema. leopold just made another attempt.

guernsey (maria kraakman - belgium/netherlands 2005).the mousy maria kraakman plays anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (fedja van huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him. she painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all. we barely know anything about her background or her motivations. just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life. she obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?i almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. these were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making. i'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place. how on earth did nanouk leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? obviously, there was no script to speak off. it could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal. none whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, "i want to do something from a woman's point of view". the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.to make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film. i cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but johanna ter steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material. i'm trying to imagine how leopold tried directing maria kraakman: "maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness". a perfect cure for insomnia. get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteed too put you to sleep.camera obscura --- 1/10

anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city. she has been with her husband sebastiaan for years and they don't talk so much anymore. while on a working visit abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. anna is deeply impressed by her death, even though she hardly knew her. nobody seems to know why she took her own life. for the first time anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest. anna doesn't mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child. guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life. and she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her.(this is my translation of the dvd cover text synopsis. i hope you find it useful, as this movie doesn't have an imdb plot summary yet at this date.)

this film uses all art-house clichés (slow pace, long static shots, minimal amount of dialog) to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here: there is no plot to speak of, the characters are dreary (female lead) or cliché (tersteeghe's character), and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives. the film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery. instead of confronting him, she half-heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself. after a fight and a reconciliation with her sister - who knew about the adultery without telling her - she asks her husband to stop cheating on her. they seem to be re-united as a family. two other story lines - the planned move of the woman's elderly father with his young wife to guernsey and the rivalry with the woman's sister - do not offer any interesting developments. the suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself. for 2005 - or any other year for that matter - this is not enough to make an interesting film.moreover, what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided, as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move. both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past - over much more important things than furniture: men - this could in theory lead to a confrontation. or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other. either way, this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development. the film clearly sets this situation up (with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws) but it cheats us out of any resolution: the scene simply ends and how this - in itself rather dreary and materialistic - issue is solved, is not shown. although almost completely absent, the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid. for example, when during a visit to guernsey, the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish "yes it is - no it isn't" ring to it. the fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog - giving a highly artificial, overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact. the way the woman finally - finally! - addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed - and is at the same time completely unbelievable. the husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any, it is not shown. the woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband. the scene showing the woman, husband and their young son asleep on an airliner, watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end, but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely.because of its slow pace, uninteresting story, leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog, i found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art-house movie and a complete waste of time.

for me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria: form, function and meaning. guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. the long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself. because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz. an introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say. this film acts like an introvert person. if you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide (and the unanswered question why?) that changes anna's view on life and makes her suspicious. 'why don't you speak to me?' asks sebastiaan. anna doesn't answer, she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word. what is the function of that shot? what does it mean? my question is like sebastiaans: what has this film to say? what is meant by this movie? the answer for me: it shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water. the story of their lives is simple and boring. motives behind their actions are not shown. the rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. nice and artistic done, but meaningless without having disposal of 'instructions for use'. in my opinion this film is made for fellow artists, not for the common viewer.

definitely the worst movie i have ever seen... can somebody tell me where should have i laughed? there's not a single hint or shadow of an idea. the three leading actors are pestilential, especially the one (i think it's aldo) from sicily who _can't_ make a sicilian accent!!! not to say about the dream-like insertion about dracula... just another expedient, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "film" last a little longer. massironi and littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too, too hard to rescue. i would have given it "0"/10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so i had to overestimate it by one mark.

i don't know what i missed here, but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film. i thought it was silly, and a bit over the top. i did like the performances of gregg henry and michael rooker, however the others were just... boring.now i like b movies, i really do, but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me. i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to "army of darkness" and "shaun of the dead", as well as "on par with the re-animator". you must be joking. i didn't find this film funny, it tried, it did make an effort, (possibly too much of an effort), but it failed in my opinion. by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th one-liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.there were definitely homages made to several other films, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. but here it may have just been a lack of original thought. admittedly there were some nice special effects, good gore, but that can't carry an entire movie. the mutated grant looked like a cross between jabba the hut, and in the early stages of mutation- chet from "weird science" (after he was turned into the monster) and one of the alien creature/children from "the explorers". it just didn't work. i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed. then there was brenda, the woman that grant impregnated and chained up in the barn. when help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. the design once again was totally unimaginative. a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle. *yawn* now about the zombies- the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a. romero had a patent on them and was the only writer/director allowed to make movies about them. he's the only person so far to do it right, with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg (but that was a comedy). oh, and danny boyle, but they were a different style of zombie. maybe mr. romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan, groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re-animated. the people of "wheelsy" just didn't have the proper motivation... they were horrible zombies.so in the end i give "slither" a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes.

slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. it has one scene that is exceptionally good, any number of zingers that work, but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie. in addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places.a major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero (fillion) to follow grant grant (michael rooker) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster. this whole part of the film drags - michael rooker's character isn't that interesting to us as a person, and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster's interest might be interesting if this was grant - portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror-comedy alien invasion movie. in the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates. the purpose of a horror-comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them, with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens. instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. the ostensible heroine (elizabeth banks as starla grant) is more central to this part, but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track, unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end.when fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook, but once again the problem is in the script. by this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that grant is not just suffering from some disease, and act accordingly (shotguns) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that "let us get you to a hospital" is going to help. although their reactions might have been human and real, these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action. a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.*** spoilers ahead *** after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack (a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie) the script once again betrays the movie. at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien. the writer-director (gunn) chooses as this character a completely new character, rather than one of already developed minor characters. why? why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot? by the time this character is attacked, we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her, even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath. had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters, he could have completely avoided introducing her family, and saved time and money. furthermore, the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien's plans without all the additional characters, and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.my last criticism is based on the movie's look. gunn is primarily a writer, or maybe it was budgetary constraints, but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting. most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field, and the screen simply looks drab. the sets in wheelsy (the fictional town where the action takes place) look cheap. the whole movie looks cheap. box office mojo states the films' budget was $15 million, newspapers say $29 million, and considering they didn't use any name talent, i would say the money did not show up on screen. the monster is just repulsive, and rarely looks deadly.the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions. by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grant/the alien, one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals. at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff. a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered, and a local has been acting psychotic. time to call the authorities. but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act.although this movie is ostensibly a horror-comedy, the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions. whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story (especially the entire morgan freeman subplot) and particularly the ending, in many ways it was stronger, primarily because the main characters were stronger, but more importantly because it looked beautiful. although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither.

what a preposterous story ,murder blackmail,child sex allegations ,gays and the catholic church.....absolute tripe. how is it that most uk based tv dramas ,sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay,its really getting tiresome now. everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups,but we don't want it ramming down our throats(i'll pass on this one) in every single show. apart from the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime,the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where,oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black.i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script.

it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb, because i would not have hesitated! in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. i, like many others, bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it, it could be good... no chance! this film was shocking! imagine a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful', well, primal instinct did not even come close to that good, and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'the bold and the beautiful'. michael madsen, how could you do this to us? the worst part is, i didn't fast forward a bit, i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film.where do i start...? directing - zero stars, screenplay - zero stars, acting - zero stars, cinematography - zero stars, digital effects - zero stars, production design - zero stars, make-up - zero stars, casting - zero stars, editing - zero stars, trailer - half a star, graphic design - half a star, dvd menu - half a star.however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is, so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film, just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list.

this has to be, by far, the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years. when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films, and he was a pretty fair actor. wrong! no one should waste their time on this film. i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing.

"kids like these" could have been a decent film, given the subject matter. but instead it has become a below-average, run-of-the-mill tv-movie of the week, with not much going for it. the acting is stale, the plot predictable and the direction non-existent. for a better movie on the same subject, try the excellent "le huitième jour", a film that really cares about the people with down-syndrome. in "kids like these" they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality. pretty appalling. 1/10

the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code. geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.i honestly didn't like the style of the movie. i believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what i don't get is why there is so much of it. the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all. it gives the comic book like experience. however it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises.the movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.i will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit.

i watch lots of scary movies (or at least they try to be) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through. i never knew the depths of masacism until i rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive. i am a fan of julian sans, but this is worse than i would hope for him.on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued...for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand. perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me, especially when we had to turn the video off, and that simply is not done with our watching (we had to make one exception obviously). if it were up for a remake, i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it. that's all.

this is the movie that i use to judge all other bad movies, and so far there hasn't been anything close.the only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see.

ok, if you're looking for another bastketball diaries, this is completely the wrong film.i revolves around two brothers. max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. adam, the eldest, is a doctor. this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. it however, does not. it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways. eventually adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs).this movie has almost no climax. doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, adam, is horrific.i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher. if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'the basketball diaries'. and notice the difference.try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. try and see for yourself...

one star. that's all this documentary deserves. i haven't felt this disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, in quite some time.i'm a big fan of the "walking with..." series, including it's nigel marvin spin-offs, for all their gleeful fun yet informative information. and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. having seen all the other docs from the series, i figured i need to see this one as well, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc... what were you thinking?! lol.though the information that they were able to get through was interesting, the presentation failed in every other way possible. it had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place), horrible effects (that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects), and overused mtv-style camera effects.speaking of the makeup effects, one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie. well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous. none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks remotely real. it doesn't even look like it was taken seriously. it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had. remember the episode in "walking with dinosaurs" of the fate of the ornithochirus (sp?)? that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it. it's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all. when you are more engaged in the subject and it's own personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it.the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration (at least in the bbc version i saw) and the music. otherwise, do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh (which i did frequently, but usually followed by rolling eyes). this does not belong on the shelf with the other "walking with..." docs.and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series? hmmm...

this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen (spoilers ahead)! first of all, the plot is stupid. the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it. we find that the kid has a gift, the "shining". this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool. then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because... well, he feels like it. why else would he do it? all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub. the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse, which is utterly disgusting. somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe. then the kid and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies within minutes of hypothermia. most movies aren't a complete waste of time, but this falls right into that category. the music is trashy, the characters are corny (except jack nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the storyline is slow, tedious, and boring. this movie is extremely overrated. avoid this movie at all costs. i'm surprised it's gotten such a high rating on imdb.

after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie, i knew what was supposed to happen. i had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. i have a couple main points for not liking this movie.********** spoilers **********1. the casting. jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character. also, i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy. i pictured wendy much differently. i can see why they picked jack nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. he's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. also, they make one of the worst movie couples. danny was alright, he needed more life though. he acted way to droney.2. the screenplay. they cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! i was extremely irritated.3. the ending. the ending was changed completly, halorann died, jack froze to death, wendy never got hurt...the overlook didn't blow up. the ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, i was apalled. hallorann was never supposed to die, but jack killed him with an ax. if they wanted to kill him, at least have jack use a roque mallet. you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.there are other things that i didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. the camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. i reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more. i would never have done that, i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day. i can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.rating: 2/10

i am going to keep this short.this "adaption" of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more.of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall.the story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes.my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the tv series ....oh ,and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing "masterpieces" like "eyes wide shut".

ok, honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. its really not. there were two good things that came out of this movie 1. jack's performance, he was very good i can tip my hat for him. 2. danny's performance, he was good. no other then that it got pretty stupid. and, what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy? she was so bad. she looked the same every time she got scared. the problem with this movie was the ending. i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently. and, the over all movie was just stupid. the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.

ladies and gentlemen,please don't get fooled by "a stanley kubrick" film tag.this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.in shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.there is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes.

not the best of the films to be watched nowadays. i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good. but this movie disappointed me. the sound and environment was good, but there was no story here. not was there a single moment of fright. i expected it to a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror no thriller. the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing "wednesday". there are lots of fragments i the movie. most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything. the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown. might be a good movie to watch in the 80's, but not for the 21st century.

these writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. if i owned a video store i'd put it in the boring section. this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. well i drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. even the little kid does it too. round and round he goes and he never stops. what's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too.the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. that's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.

many king fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. that notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. i'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. i always follow up with the question "really... exactly what scene scared you?" every fan i've asked, goes silent. occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (there are none...), names the "grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators" shtick. if you're afraid of that, i don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. i just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down. really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. oh, and nice choice for mr. halloran's artwork stanley! black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. has there ever been a more "off," out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them. toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson, the introduction of dumb one-liners at tense moments, and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie.

******spoilers******the unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi, karloff, and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland, sporatically watchable haunted house spoof. lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress' fortune; karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums, but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi. of course, kay kyser and his band of 30-something year old "kids" uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way. not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist.

solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy. the script contains all the standard mystery film props-sliding panels, secret passageways, thunder and lightning and poisoned blow-darts. karloff, lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era. kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940's who were trying to forget about the horror's of world war ii.

i knew my summary would get you. how is this movie like a pet rock and disco?! well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why anyone would like a new coke or own a pet rock (and frankly, at least in the case of pet rocks, i still don't understand it completely). they're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. the same can be said for kay kyser and his band. at the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre in this film. yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of "entertainment". after all, kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). frankly, i couldn't stand their antics nor did i appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.the film involves kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. eventually, it culminates in some attempts on sally's life and a séance (of sorts). it's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.overall, it's passable entertainment at best. as a lugosi and karloff fan, i sure felt cheated having to watch kyser and his knuckleheads.

one of the silliest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser. kyer, orchestra leader and radio-star (and eternal college fraternity goof-off), was sort of the precursor to spike jones, hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians. he's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall. the shindig is beset with a creepy judge, a scary professor, an ominous swami, lots of giggly females, and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures. the songs (by jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer) are nothing to brag out, and neither is over-confident kyser, yukking it up with elbow-in-the-ribs material that turns 1940 back ten years. * from ****

i'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful, despite several good performances and generally competent acting-for-the-camera direction. it's a first and last attempt by writer-director soo lyu. "rub and tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of canada's program to promote home-grown film-making. while the program encourages worthwhile efforts like "new waterford girl" it opens the door for untalented novices like lyu who did not have to aggressively pitch this project but was green-lighted without an adequate examination of her script or her credentials. you don't mind the low budget because the shabby production design, bad lighting, poor audio, and dreary docu-style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter; the workers in canadian massage parlors. but the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to assemble, or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief. when your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique; even though nothing happens, the movie is hard to follow and point-of-view impossible to pin down. don mckellar's performance as conrad is several notches below his similar characterization in "exotica". lindy booth's lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is likable but here she is little else. kira clavell's cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of asian shelley duval. the only other role of any consequence, tara spencer-nairn's street-wise betty, more than cancels out her excellent performance in "new waterford girl". her shallow performance in "rub and tug" should curtail any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of "waterford" director alan moyle's skill in working with young actors. you quickly conclude that lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and lame "deus ex machina" device toward the end is hardly a surprise. still it could be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.

i hate this movie! it was nothing like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. if you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. but king's book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it. i mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. the ending for example! so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr. halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important. overall, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off.

if my memory is correct, when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry. if that's what it's supposed to be, it doesn't really work. it just isn't that funny. setting that rather significant (since this is called a comedy!) failure aside, since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, i'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour, except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull. for over an hour, this movie really doesn't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters. conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren't giving "full service" - a euphemism for actual sex. as for the girls themselves, betty's goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business, cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is - well, leah is a somewhat strange, undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well, because she's in it! i have no idea what her character was about. those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.the movie meanders about and doesn't offer much until the "twist" reveals conrad to be the bad guy. we should have gotten to that point sooner. the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - conrad's secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls. that plan for revenge was pretty good, and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this. had the story been more focused on the revenge, this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.the performances from the 4 leads were all ok, although i didn't think anyone came across as outstanding. all four characters were a bit shallow. cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. given the subject matter, there's surprisingly little nudity (and what there is is restricted to one scene.) in fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. as for the overall quality of the movie, it's a low-budget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, i suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so that's forgivable. it certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director soo lyu's resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry - that it wasn't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards - the canadian version of the oscars. 4/10 - and i'm being a bit generous with that.

this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing! rachel griffiths must have needed the money. the film must have been made on a very low budget, because the lighting was non existent. i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide. i'd be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2)a script. my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish.

billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty, about unemployed men in sheffield, this movie is a fake.as someone born in sheffield, and still with links to the city, i was extremely disappointed by this film. someone said it could have been set in oklahoma, and that just about sums it up for me. this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market. probably many americans - and many southern english people - don't realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants, with a sophisticated urban culture. in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead-end semi-rural small town, where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old-fashioned pub, and where the people's idea of a party was line-dancing in some village-hall lookalike. this was a small close-knit community, not a metropolitan city.the working-class sheffield men were totally unlike their real-life counterparts, who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks. they don't chatter, and they certainly don't sing in choirs.even the rural settings, supposedly in the peak district, looked alien to me. i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking, but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales. indeed, in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd, wales. the peak district is, in the summer, crawling with walkers and tourists in cars. it is situated between two big cities. it is not some kind of wilderness.as for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with, and lust after, pete postlethwaite, that was ludicrous, and could only have been a male dream. her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent. none of the men was shown as having a partner or families; they existed in a vacuum.anyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray. this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle-class writers and film-makers.it was a gigantic fake!

what a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is star wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. utterly disappointing.

this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it, and it has the words "star" and "wars" in its title. that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. this is a travesty.first things first. the story. anakin's evolution? there is none. apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. he becomes young, stupid, cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow. the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith? unacceptable!the fight scenes used too many digital doubles. everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. count dooku, emperor palpatine, anakin, obi-wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.in one specific fight scene, obi-wan and anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. i realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.the writing was awful. all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn't enough. i can't say enough bad things about this film. too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. this is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. we know the rough picture of everything, all lucas did was colour it in.we knew anakin lost his limbs. we knew luke and leia are brother and sister, we knew luke is anakin's son, we knew obi-wan and yoda go to exile, we knew everything. nothing new is offered in this film. if that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, lucas couldn't have gone wrong.but when anakin finally becomes darth vader, and he asks after padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams "nooooooooooooooooooooo." that scene screamed b-movie all the way, and i was half expecting darth vader to go "danger will robinson, danger" at any time. that is what this is. a b-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth.

revenge of the sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. the only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and i mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of darth vader. and when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. not great. not even good. but pretty all right. this movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. but you have to say, wow, those cgi environments are really impressive at times. bu the lightsabre fights? they're all a blurry mess. i think the dark side took hold of lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. this will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. i saw the 12:01 show, and after it, i heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! but everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: i fell asleep in the middle. it was kind of boring. i just thought seeing the birth of darth vader would be better. so said we all.

first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies...i don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). i am simply a fan of the films.with that being said, i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (ep 1, 2), i don't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie r2 suddenly being a badass, and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch), horrible acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? there was no real internal dilemma within anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the "noooooo!" frankenstein scene). when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is not a great movie. for a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of all characters.i close with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?

i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released. many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king. the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed "master" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. "salem's lot" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini-series, directed by tobe hooper (he of "texas chainsaw massacre" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a "chiller theatre" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. fans hoped that a director of kubrick's stature would succeed where hooper had failed. it didn't happen.sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it's all downhill. jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson. he's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here. i don't care that many reviewers here think he's all that in this clinker, the "here's johnny!" bit notwithstanding...he's just awful in this movie. so is everyone else, for that matter. scatman crothers' character, dick halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest "shock" sequences ever put on film. i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. king's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom.this movie still stinks and why so many think it's a horror masterpiece is beyond me.

ludicrous. angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin, who somehow seems appealing to amidala, 5 years his senior. now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. ludicrosity squared.i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. the story is ridiculous. the characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of "fantastic", "wonderful", etc.).obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations. none of that here. the story could have been written by a 10 year old.oh yeah, the cgi is pretty cool.

i'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. with jedi, menace, clowns and sith we have the death of lucas' career. he wants us to swallow the annakin is vader nonsense? i never believed it was true. this film vindicates those feelings. the story hasn't worked since phantom moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade. i have to go. i know where some new rocks to throw are. you want spoilers? here they come. luke and leia are not related. vader is not their father. duke countoo should have switched sides while he still could. yoda has less verbal skills than yogi berra. his advice has never been any good to anybody. obi wan lied to luke for the first two films. annakin didn't build c3p0. he found him in the desert and lied to his mom about putting him together from scratch. chewbacca has fleas. this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h amma-lamma-ding-dong. if she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of annie, but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her. what a dope!

to make a film straddling the prequels and the "real" star wars trilogy would tax even a great film-maker....mr lucas is not that film-maker.to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor...mr christensen is not that actor.the first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star wars.count dooku (christopher lee) has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent! no the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great (overlong) sequence at the lava falls

well, i finally saw it. i didn't go when it first came out because, well, frankly, i was afraid. afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. while not as bad as menace, and better than clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying.i was 11 years old when i saw star wars. i still remember sitting in the theater. from the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience i'll never forget. a timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting.and that's not to chastise lucas for using an old formula. it's an old formula precisely because it works. and to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. the great villain, vader was luke's father. wow, no one saw that coming. of course, i'm convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. go back and watch star wars again. knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.which brings me to the problem i have. revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. but a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as i'm forced to realize george lucas is (the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--liam neeson, natalie portman, samuel jackson).*****spoilers ahead******** the plot. oh my. understand, he's already handicapped by what's happened in the first two films so it's an incredible burden. one too much for him to overcome.first we have the sheer absurdities of the background. we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the "chosen one". well, this detail never gets remotely explained. indeed, the closest explanation is yoda's observation that maybe they were wrong. oh, well, okay then. our mistake.now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c3po. hey, what a coincidence that is. and he'll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there? wow! how about that. testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh george? anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history--the great tragedy of darth vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.how, pray tell, does this happen? why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the "dark one to be" to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been chasing for two films tells him that he's got the secret to immortality.well, of course he does.sheesh.how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? how can anyone expect us to care? hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.oh, by the way, amidala finally dies. in childbirth. why? well, they don't know. the doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of "she's lost the will to live". well, oh, okay, of course she has. maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.but here we are. we have kenobi present for all this. he knows of the birth of luke and leia. knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. knows, also, the role of both r2 and c3po. and yet, in several years, as luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3po and r2 (curiously, 3po's mind is wiped, but not r2's--why????) stating "i think these droids belong to you", kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be "the chosen one" and apprentice to the emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says "strange, i don't recall owning any droids".oh good grief.lucas simply made this up as he went along. once he introduced vader as luke's father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because he didn't know what the story was. the plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all. and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars.it's an afterthought, and it looks it.i can't give this movie a high rating. it reminds me of triple x. a fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. star wars will stand in my mind forever. thankfully, this one, and the two preceding it, will soon fade.

at one point, violet (lucy liu) tells neil (cillian murphy) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure. she said "because i'm bore-phobic". it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. well, i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic. because "watching the detectives" is a cheer boredom. have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once? neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop. he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward. but neil's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store. she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal, whereas neil is completely opposite to hers. the question is. is they are going to be in love at the end? you bet."watching the detectives" is a cliché romantic-comedy to its core. and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else. from the first couple of set-up, we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who didn't really commit to anything. and then, violet enters the scene, looking all weird and annoying. so at this point, we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end. is it worth waiting for? i would say no.as i said, they tried to give something more for the audience. "watching the detectives" is trying to talk about commitment. to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire. we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart (or whatever). well, i think it is completely bullshit. this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself "forget about it, that girl is one of a nutjob !" after collaborating with many great directors recently (danny boyle's "sunshine" and "28 days later", ken loach's "the wind that shakes the barley" and neil jordan's "breakfast on pluto" to name a few), it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop, paul soter. by all means, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this. on the other hand, lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet. her acting is a mess. i mean it's all over the place and so over-the-top. tony montana would have been proud.the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title. you simply can't really connect a dot between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. in short, "watching the detectives" is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine.bloodymonday rating: 1.5/4

lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them.unfortunately 'watching the detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and audience alike: not to fall asleep during a mind-numbingly boring, very predictable and unimaginative story.'watching the detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule.after a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and relatives, is even hinted at, not to mention actually happening.i'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old b&w film she couldn't care less about. 'watching the detectives (2007)' is nowhere near category b, it falls somewhere between q & r, like -questions? and -repress the questions! the director knows what he's doing! well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he has done a very good job!'watching the detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for lucy alexis liu and cillian murphy, bur please don't let it be a waste of your time!rating: 0 out of 100.

basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns. watching the detectives has none of that.the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads, not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style. i mean, this film is centered around movies, yet is itself incredibly uncinematic! that's a major failing right there.but the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (murphy and liu) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way. so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem, well, not terribly interesting.oh, yeah, another thing: for a romantic comedy? it's not funny. and the romance isn't terribly romantic, either.so avoid it. even at its 90-something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through...

i'm not even gonna waste time on this one; it's not funny, not scary, practically unwatchable and only occassionaly gory(the fx suck though(no pun intended)). this is a disclaimer; watch at your peril! ask yourself 1 question; are slugs scary?

just kidding! this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen! it was so bad though, that it was hilarious. my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad. cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs. the plot stunk, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrendous. but i sure had a blast watching it!

is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. so in that respect, imdb's average voting score is spot on.a spanish film made in the usa with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of "falcon crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.the slugs involved are originals from asturias, northern spain, but as they were not allowed into the united states, plastic ones had to be made. however, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other us forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). the actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.as a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as chapter 17,000 of coronation street or the latest news from baghdad.

kubrick meets king. it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, i remember. then the movie came out, and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since.the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. the kubrick cultists don't give a damn about king's story. they talk about steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.this is a film, they insist: it should be considered on its own. as it happens, both camps are correct. unfortunately.if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel, "the shining" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits. i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter. the writer diane johnson (author of le marriage, l'affaire, le divorce, etc.) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. but the little blue-collar town of sidewinder, colorado doesn't exist on any map in her francophile universe. kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial, however. he, of course, is the real auteur. and considered on its own merits, his screenplay for "the shining" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.i'm willing to consider kubrick's "shining" on its own terms. i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie. but it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.are the horrors of the overlook hotel real? or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a "ghost" he is in fact looking into a mirror. one notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize jack's stunted, convoluted psyche. very deep stuff.but if indeed the overlook's "ghosts" are purely manifestations of jack torrance's growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet, so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?and can anyone explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled "1921") of nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance's bad craziness stems from a some sort of "past life" experience? (and if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)maybe kubrick didn't care about his storyline. maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. as a result, the story is a mess. this movie hasn't improved with age, and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings.i don't deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. but those gushing elevators o' blood, seen repeatedly in little danny's visions, are absurd and laughable. and jack torrance's infamous tag lines ("wendy, i'm home!" and "heeeeeere's johnny!") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. (i know: i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: "whew! glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!") finally, kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. a foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? yikes, now i really am afraid.given jack nicholson's brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. the performance of shelley duvall, as a sort of female version of don knotts in "the ghost and mr. chicken," is best passed over in silence.this movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. it probably merits a 3 out of 10, but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over-rated in this forum.

in all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. true ther are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just plain awful. i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs. i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man. this was rather amusing.

a disappointing film.the story established our protagonist as chrissy, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much. actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives. it's a pity though, chrissy seem like interesting character.story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. so the question now is, when are we going to see the campions, jacksons, and the tamahori's breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?technically, a disgusting shot film.

'succubus', the edited version of 'necronomicon geträumte sünden', is a struggle to sit through, even at a lean 76 minutes; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma.jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics, since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever. apparently, this is one of the better of his 180+ films  it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.the unfathomable plot deals with franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s&m for good measure, and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this.

i've come to realise from watching euro horror, especially films made by cult luminary jess franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense. however, franco has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film. i've got to admit that i saw the american cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, i'm sure the longer european version is just as boring. the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing s&m and talking rubbish, and it's all really boring. there's no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; i had difficulty making it all the way to the end. i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.

this is definitely not one of lucio fulci's better flicks by any stretch of the imagination. the plot is pretty bad, a millionaire is murdered and his spirt calls upon his daughter to find out who did it. but the biggest problem i have with this (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why anyone should even care? the father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across (including the daughter who he asks to help him) which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him. but no one really watches a fulci flick for a good storyline, to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting. typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie. if you're looking for a good fulci flick, check out the beyond.

he really lost the plot with this one! none of his distinctive trademarks here at all, an uninteresting plot and completely terrible acting make this his worst film (in my opinion). even his trademark gore is gone, bar one scene in an operating theatre. oh well, at least his next film 'nightmare concert' showed that he could still shock when he wanted to...

more of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in; mediocre overall.it starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed, goes into the room of her crying child, and kills it. she wakes up. then, that man is dying in a hospital, spitting up blood. his estranged daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through her dreams (i think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave.there's not too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed. i'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked.anyway, the horror elements get in through: a gory autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave.i was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by fulci to clive barker! interesting.

action, violence, sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie. and everything they do is done without reason. mark l. lester is (un)known for his violent (without reason)movies (commando, the base). the story is weird but stupid. the actors play their stupid characters very well...i'm not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors. it's another low-budget unknown b series action movie. if you saw something like operation delta force, drive, the patriot, sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than misbegotten...don't rent it...and, by the way, don't rent any of the movies i mentioned....i give it 1and a half out of5.

routine suspense yarn about a sociopath (dillon) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman (antony) and his husband (mancuso). extremely predictable, far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way. don't lose your time with this one...make a baby instead!

even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'succubus' is often named as the best jess franco film. heck, even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts 'succubus' among his personal favorites. so, maybe it's me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. the opening is great, though, and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage. it's all downhill from here, unfortunately. reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. this could have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. it's supposed to be psychedelic but i'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. half of the time, you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages. this most certainly isn't franco's best film according to me. i wouldn't even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. if you're looking for more superior jess franco film, try to get your hands on 'las vampiras', 'the awful dr. orloff' or 'female vampire'.

i watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. it was fairly easy to watch (at 3am). it had good casting - kevin dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling. the rest of the main characters weren't so bad either.this is your typical stalker/suspense movie. a married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help. a sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.as i said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see "conan" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. of course things don't work out for him the way he planned. not a bad plot line.but, the last 15 minutes were just horrible. i am pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!).. but, i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written. i actually scoffed outloud!all in all, not the worst movie i've seen, but i wouldn't be able to sit through it again (unless i skipped the ending). the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillon's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.try looking around at the other channels before watching this.. but, if nothing better is on, i'd give it a try.. =)

grand central murder (1942) dir: s. sylvan simon production: mgm this mediocre 'b' mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with simon as director. surely he could have fit another red skelton film or two on his schedule! anyway, grand central murder is a shameless rip-off of the thin man films minus the wit, charm, and chemistry of the leads. we are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes, bad acting and weary gags.van heflin and virginia grey play nick and nora char--er, rocky and butch custer. he's a pi and she's his wife and sleuthing partner. they engage in "humorous" banter with each other. see? it's completely different already. heflin's the only one here who hints at bigger and better things, although he's real close to being a jerk in this. virginia grey was in another thin man, but again, let me stress, this film is nothing like that one, no sir. and just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film (say, the thin man) we actually like, sam levene pops up as the lead detective who's kind of dim and has to have van heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads. hmmm.quickly, the 'murder' is that of bitchy schemer mida king, who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one. she's played by patricia dane, who's like a c- version of hedy lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into an f. there's a whole array of wacky suspects, all with their own motivation for wanting mida dead. there's the society type, the tough talking dames, the thug, the ex-lover, and a shady theater impresario (tom conway, here saddled with the unlikely character name of 'frankie ciro'). roman bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something i believe he may have done before. millard mitchell plays an idiot cop who, in a running gag that won't quit, can't stop thinking about the piece of ass he's got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up (that's right, millard mitchell, swordsman). finally, in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling, something we've never seen before, all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories (as flashbacks) to the detective, as rocky takes mental notes, until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession.on top of the actual picture being a dud, i naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942-era grand central, but alas, no. there's merely one very brief shot at the beginning. thanks for nothing, grand central murder. so, to sum up, a wee bit formulaic, but heflin was okay.*½ out of 4

i have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. as i watched it, i started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? so i had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. so, either way, it is pretty bad. i actually didn't make it to the end. i had to shut it off. i am a nyc police officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers. so, i took it a little personal. maybe i was blinded by that, and it isn't as bad as i personally think it is. everyone has their own opinion.

a blair witch-war movie that is as much of a letdown as bwitch was! the title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as "once upon a time in america", "the shawshank redemption" or "enemy at the gates" (if you want to watch a great "war" movie) etc.this movie, if it were a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and single a was the rookies, then this movie was high school ball. it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera. sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but i don't call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! this is a pass all the way! now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.

this is a complete hoax...the movie clearly has been shot in north western indian state of rajasthan. look at the chase scene - the vehicles are indian; the writing all over is hindi - language used in india. the drive through is on typical jaipur streets. also the palace is in amer - about 10 miles from jaipur, rajasthan. the film-makers in their (about the film) in dvd bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in kabul and around. almost all of their action scenes are shot in india. the scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to afgani folk song. they just recorded the rajasthani folk song. how do i know it because i have traveled that area extensively. they are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. i do challenge the film makers to deny it.

i just got back from this free screening, and this "osama witch project" is the hands-down worst film i've seen this year, worse than even "catwoman" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.in "september tapes," a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" heads to afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on sept. 11 - to track down osama bin laden.they "made" eight tapes on their journey, which now "document" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (the eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary.")the psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching "macgyver" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. i don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said "shoot me."the crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. you wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.around "tape 4," i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i was going to get up and leave at tape 4 but i stuck it out. i now consider myself a masochist! afghanistan? come on guys! who's the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards? i thought the lead actor(george calil) was particularly inept. apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake, i thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make "larson the lunatic implodes, all over a screen near you" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. using a phone call from larson's wife, sarah, supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day, was appalling. the camera shake didn't make me feel sick, that cold hearted stunt did.

amateurish in the extreme. camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators needn't spin around all the time.the script is truly inane, and the acting is even worse. on top of that, the story is disjointed and meandering - with some gaping holes in logic. at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al-quada operatives, and thus get an interview with osama. i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws. the "filmmaker"/lead role really portrays a rash, idiot frat boy. the only item of interest really, is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location. it's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting.who financed this crap?

well, basically, the movie blows! it's blair witch meets sean penn's ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" is really about. the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things--but it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched), and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck. it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd. i'd rather watch the blair witch viii, than sit through that again.

this movie fails miserably on every level. i have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again. did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? my god, i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad. i'd rather watch ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. that's my two cents.

i had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad film. it fails on pretty much all levels; the cast is awful, the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.a bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie.

if it wasn't for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this "documentary" i would never have seen this comedy! this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments. one in particular is where the afghan police / soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away, still filming, presumably to his plush hotel. then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion.i am surprised this has currently got the rating it has (5.8 / 10). i thought imdb users had more sense.

i watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an irritatingly overly dramatic "on camera" producer).when i realized it was all staged i thought "why would i want to waste my time watching this junk??" so i turned it off and came online to warn other people. the characters don't act in a believable way. too much immature emotion. for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country, he acted like a kid. and i don't believe it was because "his character was so upset about the trade center bombings".very trite and stupid.have you seen "city of lost children"? french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams... i liked it!

i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one, but when i started with it i found it really awful. they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in india. you can see indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an indian water brand), hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan. i think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time

i went into this hoping it would be the "thought provoking" little gem people have reviewed this as. i love indy films and expected to dig this too. knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained, maybe even see an outsiders perspective.all i can say is wow....if your into self torture, or mutilation then maybe you'll like this. personally i don't like the idea of being pee'd on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad editing....i could go on. i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10. that's misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on imdb isn't setting a precedent! it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it's controversial (this film is not, it tries very hard to be but fails). you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically. unfortunately they do die, but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured. do yourself a favor, just don't even bother. i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for .50 and feel ripped off!

the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip-off of joeseph conrad's heart of darkness ,the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is osama.the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud totake this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factualwhile some portions have muslims supporting the 9/11 attacks for the usa's treatment of muslims around the world .i alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their "documentary" section and be placed in the war-drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events.

what a terrible film. it sucked. it was terrible. i don't know what to say about this film but dinocrap, which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass. ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh.. it's not roger corman that i hate, it's this god-awful movie. well, really? but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics. which is another thing, the cgi sucked out loud; i hate this movie dreadfully. this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b-movie, and probably the gayest b-movie too. it's-it's--- dinocrap! i'm sorry, i must have offended some nerds in these moments. it's just an awful movie... 0/1,000

this is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for. dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. the dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. jane longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs. i enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general. overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.

now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end. first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you? and heres another point for pondering, why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall, that was a heart breaker. but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e.v.i.l corporation. and let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off #1 as the male lead and half way decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) as the female lead to that i say wow! the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military duh!). by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc. and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living.

a large part of the scenes should be cut off. there is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off. for example the scene where the hunters mentions "i got spiders on my dick", "i like dick", playing in the mud scene, or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer.how about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman, diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women's panties three sizes too small. while they make love, didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head? why did they do in a living room? i mean his head really flipped. how about the beach scene very reminiscent of steven spielberg's jaws scene at grant lake. all these strange scene could easily be re-dubbed and billed as a comedy.here in my local town, the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about dinocroc, and i am glad i didn't watch it because i later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. the movie was that bad. i suspected that dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. it features the leg of dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old. it could easily passed over as baby geniuses.if any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash. such as diane's boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer. when this happens, who cares about dinocroc? the panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of dinocroc. his acting was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for mr. bean. move over rowan atkinson, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick. perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood.

"plan b" is strictly by-the-numbers fare except for one thing. i surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.jon cryer is the "star" of this film and plays his usual, smarmy, egotistical, snotty character that was actually endearing in "pretty in pink" and has not been amusing ever since. grating doesn't even begin to describe his performance. ricky (mark matheisen) is a muscular, blonde, struggling actor who (gasp!) is only worried about his hair and getting laid. talk about a stock character...ugh. at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging. lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded, optimistic, caring couple who are struggling to conceive. since they are not whiny drama queens, however, their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren't given enough screen time. sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina, your usual nice and good-looking young woman who just can't seem to find the right partner in love. i've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.what startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes. they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked. he was portrayed as being wild, ignorant and amazingly shallow. they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays. gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn't having any luck with guys. honestly. that wasn't that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing. her lesbian date had very short hair (like i'm sure all lesbians do). she also got quite upset (like i'm sure all lesbians do) when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick(!). finally, her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment. of course, we all know how gay people can't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years, right? (please note the sarcasm in that statement. thank you.)this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryer's unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema. 2/10

this is just a joke of a movie,they lost me already at the opening scene (spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage,this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does,well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out,omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish...pretty useless and even more dumber.and i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort. why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me.....and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie. only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget movies.if these kinda things don't bother you go see it,but be warned if your iq is above 60 you will probably hate it.

this is a low budget roger corman horror/creature flick. a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. none of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. we only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget film.my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. with no real stand out roles: jane longendecker, bruce weitz and charles napier. most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor. i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr. p. dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles.

this tv-made thriller is all talk, little action. it works hard to set up its convoluted plot, yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best. by the end, i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning. it has a quasi-"ten little indians" scenario, but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer. field overacts here with a gracelessness i've seldom seen from her. the early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top. lots of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). a curious failure from producers aaron spelling & leonard goldberg. with all this talent, couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet?

this sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. the first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it's really a "chick flick" and little else. this probably plays on the lifetime network.there was a quick murder scene and then more talk. by halfway through, they had lost me. by the way, sally field looked about 15 years old in here.

i had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. i was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. i felt quite sick by the end.although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen's 'everything you ever wanted to know about sex,...' and michael hanneke's 'funny games'--i found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. and when the film climaxed in an "orgy" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.don't get me wrong, i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema.

instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys. monkeys are funny. people with amnesia who don't say much, just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny.black comedy? there isn't a black person in it, and there isn't one funny thing in it either.walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. it's labeled unrated. i think they took out the topless scene. they may have taken out other stuff too, who knows? all we know is that whatever they took out, isn't there any more.the acting seemed ok to me. there's a lot of unfathomables tho. it's supposed to be a city? it's supposed to be a big lake? if it's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves, why are they all wearing coats?

i want to start by stating i am a republican, even though i don't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office. and i love the daily show and colbert report. they have to be two of my favorite shows on tv. i enjoy the bush jokes on conan, letterman, leno, because i admit that w is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth(i do believe he's not the dumbest either.) but it comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not really that funny anymore. i see where it can be funny and it is(hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious.). comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him. i mean maybe one special episode, but an entire series is just dumb. it seems cc is just saying the same bush jokes that we've heard way to many times. i really cannot see this show going past 1 season.

this show is not clever. that's basically what it boils down to. the "original humor" that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny. in another comment, someone quotes a couple hilarious lines. the standout for me was george h.w. bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news. wow. i thought the episodes i saw were bad. the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic.my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season. i'm a liberal republican and i know bush hasn't been a good president. we all do. but that's no excuse for putting out this utterly poopie waste of time. i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'meet the spartans'. their formula, bite off as many already unfunny topical jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit.again, just plain bad. unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is renewed, but amazing and original shows like arrested development are canned after 3 solid seasons. please don't watch this crap, unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold. oh, and the voice of bush sucks. all he does is slightly emulate a texan accent, and exhale really hard at the end of his sentences. at least south park admits the voices aren't accurate. if you want funny political satire, watch daily show/colbert. or look for any political sketches on robot chicken, which is fun to watch, since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done. look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube. priceless

abysmal with a capital "a". this has got to be one of, if not the, unfunniest show on tv right now. i'm about as anti-bush as it gets, but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me. what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show. the "jokes" are not funny at all. for example, in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: "welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!". there is nothing funny about that. is it even supposed to be joke? the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show, hyping it up, were funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season. it shouldn't even have had a first.

honestly, my expectations for little bush were low. i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) bush jokes. apparently i should have lowered my expectations even more.the writing was absolutely pathetic. aside from the cheney-chicken-eating joke, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and unfunny.the animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old's flash project. it's disgraceful that they used macromedia's product for this, because it's capable of so much more.i don't like bush that much, and i enjoy a bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half-hour swipe at the president with several painfully un-funny moments. trey parker and matt stone did so much more with that's my bush.do yourself a favor, skip "lil' bush" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "that's my bush". you'll thank me.

i am marking this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments of the show's content, not to the content itself.as i read the comments it is apparent that those republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness. one reader even (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when bush was in grade school.but as to the content as i see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must actually be really bush haters. in the episode that i saw last, s02e03, it showed that the program must have been put together long before mccain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured.another thing that caught my attention, was the use of add in closets. i thought that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the u.s.a., because i know of no home the u.s.a. that does not have built in closets, and most likely in the homes of the artists.as i watch the show, yes i do get caught up in it, i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our president. sure there are problems as most american will agree, but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world. perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so that if obama or hillary got in, would they continue to produce and air the same sort of "humor" about them?just one more comment on a commentator's remarks. if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000, according to that writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. wow, wishful thinking on his part. as far as 911 events, i do believe that it was set in motion back when clinton was president, and i can't see how if gore was president anything would be much different.

when anti-bush jokes get really easy to do, a show like this had better make sure it has something extra. when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet, it's just plain nonsense. dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly. there's also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all. the democratic characters rarely give their names so it's a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary clinton.the episodes have coherent stories but that's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking.

if the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal, then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading.this is by far one of the most boring movies i've had the pleasure to try and watch lately. i found the dvd lying around at my friend's house, and i made the sad mistake of not burning it.i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie. just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span.i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere.

where to start... if this movie had been a dark comedy, i would say it was fannn-tastic! unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price i paid, got it from wal-mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. the only thrill i got was watching kirkland's lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area. if you want a good laugh, on a rainy friday night with some friends, then i highly recommend this movie. but if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.i for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. but wow... i meant wow!! the only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by vincent berry. the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.

towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy's gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image. she convinces one that, if a nasty bette davis-type role were to come her way, she could carry it off brilliantly. unfortunately, i can't find many other reasons for seeing this. if you've wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) then here's your answer. for the rest, sally kirkland's sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome, and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes. savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it's a small role. of the leading actors, nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul keller's plight and his acting is wooden. dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little. sheedy's meticulous, understated performance (though she often seems to be on automatic pilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. the sets are drab, the camera-work undistinguished.

nicholas walker is paul, the local town reverand who's married to martha (ally sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, veronica (dara tomanovich). however in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of "misery" type of way. it's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. in a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring both elements into said movie. while this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.eye candy: dara tomanovich gets topless; sally kirkland also shows some skin my grade: c- where i saw it: showtime showcase

first of all, i was expecting "caged heat" to be along the same lines as "ilsa, the wicked warden". boy, was i wrong! in no way is this film 70s exploitation, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". sure, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear street clothes btw (quite comical), but nothing happens.there aren't strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape, and no inmates make out. there are 2 shower scenes, that i suspect is just recycled footage, but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic, and flat characters, a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to "free" their fellow inmates??!!puh-lease, the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!i feel scammed.

an executive, very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life, meets a boy with down syndrome, escaped from a residence . both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life... with this argument, the somehow amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, i didn't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie. anyway, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy), and the interpretation of both actors, daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne, was very good, i decided to go on watching the movie. the french cinema, in general, has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life, opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema. but, because of that, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap moral, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the guy waving from heaven as michael landon... really nasty, in my humble opinion.

long, boring, blasphemous. never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll.

when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays/lesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.however, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as it's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when "the ball drops". this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy-ending. nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending. so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one can't help but roll eyes towards the resolution. personally i was close to shouting "finish already!!" at the screen.there were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. so did their parents and other bi-characters. however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. he didn't even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.i give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. the script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. had the let-downs not been this disappointing, i'd easily give the film a 7 or 8. if you enjoyed this film, i'd recommend the film "east is east", which i think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.

up until the last 20 minutes, i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan's worst movie (excluding his pre-1978 work, which i am not familiar with). the final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of chan's career. but to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedy" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy's face) and endless "football" scenes. not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line "how can i turn it off? it's not a tap" - watch to find out what it refers to). "dragon lord" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors, and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies. (**)

i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic "private lessons" which portrays the dream of any male teenager."private lessons ii" has nothing to do with the title i mention. it's just a regular soft-core cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life. there's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. i watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.the women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable.

i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people. the one who wrote the brilliant "a double life" and the funny "born yesterday" and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as "adam's rib" and "pat and mike" with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome, sad drivel as "bachelor mother", "some kind of a nut", and this. the cast tries, but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated. the script sinks to it's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen's character tests drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. an ugly sequence, but sadly one which could easily play in a film today. "ethnic" jokes are now totally verboten, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".

casting bone to pick: david jannsen was 38 playing the father of robert drivas, who was then, 31 (yeah, i realize he's supposed to be just out of college, but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24-25 in the script--- that still puts jannsen in parenting classes in junior high). i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine. this movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city, circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking, the weird hair (drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip cousin it) and trendy fashions that went along with it. if anyone remembers, lv wasn't exactly london... the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days. drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous; his dad thinks he might be gay (in a sad irony, drivas himself died of aids at 47) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue (ahem, as if one may call 7 years a gap). sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino (caesar's palace!), and plies him with girls (including the horny-for-money edy williams). interestingly enough, the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay--- unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him. what nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'r' rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system (which then was g-m-r[16]- and x). the editing is horrible and there's stupid-silly overdubs by the committee (a late 60's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years). don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer... seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later. not to give anything away, but they would've dealt with mr. rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then. a curiosity at best, far from joshua logan's usual caliber of work. dos/dias. now go watch casino again...

i very much looked forward to this movie. its a good family movie; however, if michael landon jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better. too many scenes out of context. i do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good. but, if another one is made, i beg them to take better care at editing. this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center. which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great. i enjoy the story of willie and missy; they're both great role models. plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story.

garson kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern day" las vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! david janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (robert drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older jason bateman). janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out don rickles and makes him cry!). his son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of dad's lifestyle causes friction. brenda vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. unfortunately, "where it's at" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick t&a shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from ****

thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series, four for venice is not only awful, but really awful. so awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where eva works as a waitress and luis, an artist. nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress. luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick. luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday. eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation. the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another.the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy. it not only look senseless, but also draggy. in the film, nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply dumb.the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.it fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.

there is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. but it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.

the problems with this film are many, but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. first of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and tv, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. the story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but i believe the (at one time, pre-amelia, talented)director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool.

there are similarities between ray lawrence's "jindabyne" and his last movie "lantana"  a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. but whereas "lantana" offered some hope and resolution, "jindabyne" leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.the storyline - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by raymond carver. it became an element in robert altman's classic 1993 ensemble "short cuts". lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small australian community under stress. the movie poses some moral questions "would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?" and more poignantly for australians "would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?" the acting, especially by gabriel byrne and laura linney, is commendable. and there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike "picnic at hanging rock".if all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery. and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale.

nice attempt and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, human beings helping each other out,...) but a poor result... the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam... the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when "the scent of the green papaya" had a historical background... trying to project this kind of ambiance (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life...) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake. besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious.i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war... but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors... seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker.an old poet with leprosy...very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry,... even more doubtful... 

new york, i love you, or rather should-be-titled manhattan, i love looking at your people in sometimes love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation. case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy-talk, and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books. while the latter isn't a great story by any stretch, it's at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help (and maybe something more) from a girl he's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. the ethan hawke scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in (or, for that matter, hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites).what's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible 'stories' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another (i.e. bits involving bradley cooper, drea dematteo, hayden christensen, andy garcia, james caan, natalie portman, etc). it's not even so much that the film- set practically always in *manhattan* and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx (not even, say, harlem or washington heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some. it's the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in paris j'taime. it's mostly got little to do with new york, except for passing references, and at its worst (the julie christie/shia labeouf segment) it's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.so, basically, wait for tv, and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in, that is, for three scenes: the aforementioned bloom/christina ricci segment which is charming; the brett ratner directed segment (yes, x-men 3 brett ratner) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist; and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. everything else can be missed, even natalie portman's directorial debut, and the return of a hughes brother (only one, allan) to the screen. a mixed bag is putting it lightly: it's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left.

here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. that is the problem isn't? the concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. they are not believable in the way they act and interact. example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. i mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. but not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. the movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.

parasomnia has an interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach. the cast in unconvincing, even patrick kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies like scanner cop 2, open fire, under siege 2 and eraser. the rest of the cast is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of jeffrey combs. (herbert west from the great re-animator trilogy). but he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a little what he does here). the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all. the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes, especially at the end.this could have been so much better, i do not get the good reviews on this one. it is below average really.

it's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you've guessed it, that film is "parasomnia". i've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case.that's not to say parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.on the plus side, it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil, i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter. there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film. other reviewers have mentioned this here and i don't want to get into spoiler territory, but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.all in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special.

this film is very creepy indeed. unfortunately, not for the reasons the film makers would hope.there's a mastermind serial killer too, but he's not what's creepy either. he's just your standard comic book villain, a cross between hannibal lecter and freddie kruger, though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either. incidentally, for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals, can they be detained chained in a stress position, on their feet, arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out? i suppose in the world that gave us abu ghraib and guantanamo bay, anything's possible.no, what's really creepy about this film is the central character, danny. this unappealing young man, aided and abetted it's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman, and on the basis of nothing whatsoever (her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.seemingly within days, he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her, believing (completely falsely, as we discover) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else, and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment, is sexually molesting her though she is (again due to her sleepiness) entirely unable to consent or resist.our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed. he is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships, let alone sexual relationships, so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman, who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years. the scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe-making, and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror. but again, i'm afraid, not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for, but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion. we can all see clearly what's on the end of our forks here - it's the paedophile's perfect dream of innocence, sexual compliance and utter dependence. horrible, horrible, horrible.what else have we got in this mish mash? twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del toro. the compulsory "you need to go to the police" argument, where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it's the only sensible course of action. the automaton sequence, much praised in the comments here, though completely and utterly pointless ("it serves no function!", as sigourney weaver memorably protested in galaxy quest) and looking to me just like the abominable doctor phibes rehashed in one of the saw derivatives.jeffrey combs does his best though, so a star for that, and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this, and in general this is well-shot and competently performed.

i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie." i wanted to like this movie, but was unable to.the "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was quite bad. if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomnia, then it would have been a better movie.the care centre stretched credulity well past the limits, in fact it was quite ridiculous. the doctor happily ignors privacy laws and professionalism. a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without security escort), and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. the forensic patient (and the film's villain) is tied up in a standing position fully clothed - apparently for years? none of it makes much sense.the movie even had some actors that i've liked in other things, such as the detectives, but still i can't recommend this movie.

i watched this knowing almost nothing about it, other than the brief description i read here. after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish, then i looked at the other stuff he's done to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com. he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.the story was pretty awful too, could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child? i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible.

in the tower of babel installment of the mini-series, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of moses."that's like saying george washington lived many centuries before alexander the great.or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel.or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow-and-arrow.need i say more?the writers of the greatest heroes of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronologies of biblical people and events.

this u.s soap opera, 'knots landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. as for the cast, i've seen better actors on a cereal box. from the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'knots' stunk up u.k-gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies. i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). the only positive thing that can be said of 'knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the i.t.v sitcom, 'the upper hand'. great legacy that, eh?

somewhere, buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. the only traces are a few early scenes in los angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design. like i say, buried very deep. one of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations. annie mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably dee wallace from the first movie) is (was?) a werewolf is, if i recall, along the lines of; "oh! really?". not one of the better responses to said challenge. the non sequitirs continue as the story moves to trannsylvania in search of stirba the (apparently self-appointed) "queen of the werewolves". as stirba, sybil danning is the two best things in the movie. yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, reb brown's acting, and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits. the end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on youtube. check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense. if you happen to catch this on us television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath. it's a sort of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment which defies satire.

this is a pretty bad movie. but not so bad as it's reputation suggests. the production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene. and it does have an 80's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun. watch out, too, for jimmy nail's brief appearance - his attempt at an american accent is so astoundingly rubbish it's fantastic. fantastic too are sybil danning's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12" remix of sybil danning's boobs. has to be seen to be believed. as a horror movie it isn't scary, the effects are silly and christopher lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance. i guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit. the two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that i have forgotten almost everything about them and i just watched this movie earlier tonight. the werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact, bizarrely, they sometimes look more like badly burned apes. the eastern european setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band babel, while being pretty terrible, does at least give the film some added cheese.overall? good for a laugh. not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be? and, at the very least, you've always got sybil's knockers.

an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised. there's a lot of talent involved here. a great many talented actors, directors and writers. unfortunately, i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had.first of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. and unfortunately some of them clash with the others. secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped to me. like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. i'm not talking about happy endings here (or even an ending period) but rather, they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in. last but not least, i did not feel new-york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.what you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.

now this film isn't going to scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reason and a smaller one- well, that's three reasons, isn't it.the first reason this is interesting is the special effects. i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular. to see the hair growing on marsha a. hunt and sybil danning was creepy, especially when they were participating in a ménage à trois.of interest, is the fact that this marsha hunt is the famous "brown sugar" of the rolling stones song, and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair.besides the special effects, there were two other points of note in this film, and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits. i lost count, but i swear that sybil danning bared those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more. theyu were the most outstanding feature of the film.

i have always been somewhat underwhelmed by joe dante's original the howling (1981)  so i wasn't particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels; some time ago, i did catch howling iii: the marsupials (1987)  by the same director as this one  and found it to be watchable but nothing special.the second instalment, however, has quite a bad rep and i knew i'd have a good time watching it  if mainly to wallow in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon christopher lee squirming in the midst of it all (the gracefully-aged star has pathetically asserted a number of times in interviews that he hasn't appeared in horror-oriented fare since his last picture for hammer films back in 1976!). anyway, this film should have borne the subtitle "your movie is a turd"  being astoundingly inept in all departments (beginning with the all-important werewolf make-up)! the plot (and dialogue) is not only terrible, but it has the limpest connection with dante's film  strangely enough, the author of the original novel gary brandner co-wrote this himself! still, one of the undeniable highlights (er...low points) of the film is the pointless elliptical editing  which tries to give the whole a semblance of style, but only serves to accentuate its embarrassment factor! similarly phoney (and grating) are the hokey transitions between scenes, the inane punk-rock theme song, and the cheapjack special-effects at the climax! what about the characters, then?: lee is the werewolf expert, naturally, whom everybody thinks a crackpot  until they come into contact with the monsters, that is; at the very least, though, one has to admire the makers' ingenuity (or gall) in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning! incidentally, sybil danning (as stirba, werewolf bitch  the subtitle by which this is known in the u.k.!) is quite fetching in an assortment of outrageous s&m outfits...but her character is virtually given nothing to do (except preside over her brood of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious three-way lycanthrope sex!); her two snarling lieutenants (one of them a sluttish black girl) are especially irritating.aiding lee on the side of good are the two yuppie heroes (he being the brother of the dee wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers) and a ragged guerrilla-type band of transylvians (still, they generally manage to effortlessly overcome danning's rather dumb werewolves!). notable among them is a knife-throwing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty (but, at the same time, side-splitting) demise; he's later revived, under stirba's control, in order to lure lee (by making childish taunts at him all through the village streets) into a trap. the latter scene has to be a career nadir for the distinguished and imposing actor  well, either this or the early sequence in a discotheque where lee is made to don a pair of ultra-cool sunglasses so as to appear inconspicuous among the partying youngsters!in the end, if i were forced to mention elements in this which weren't entirely displeasing, i guess i could say that the ossuary set (in which the heroine is to be sacrificed) is interesting, or that the hybrid werewolf/bat creature (danning's pet who likes to 'inhabit' the body of its victims) is just too weird to be despised...

to be honest, i didn't watch all of the original 'howling', but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with "howling ii: your sister is a werewolf". i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new. i just watched it last night, and it wasn't really bad, it was just weird. i mean, the whole thing with sybil danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing (but kinda hot), christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire, etc. actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of dracula and the lost boys...except with werewolves, because everything christopher lee (whom played dracula himself) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die at night, and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania). not much for the acting, but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe. i swear, at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out, because that damn throat always had to say something. anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clichéd, so there's no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on wikipedia. by the way, the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original (not counting howling iv (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't see this movie. there's no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just horrible special fx. 3/10

in the first howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. the plot in that film made some sense; a tv reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth. she ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one. then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live tv. the special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one. whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.the plot line isn't all that bad; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. this won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it...they just want to kill her. i think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.after the film "ends" we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some devo-esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves. the only thing that makes this movie even watchable is christopher lee.

we had starz free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on . it was this movie howling ii: the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great. sybil danning and marsha brown as the afore mentioned eye candy. i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i saw.my friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies , if they saw this film they would know why. i would get thrown out for laughing so hard.just a couple of trivia notes : reb brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie marsha brown was mick jaggers inspiration for the song "brown sugar" mick has great taste in women for sure.

yes, the first "howling" was a classic. a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie, however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. maybe you could have gotten into "an american werewolf in london" hell that could have been possible. it was set in london after all. heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. in fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding.

lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii, then he quipped, "the less said about that the better." indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. it was a film to be taken seriously. like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point). this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. there is absolutely nothing scary about it. it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, i'll cede ferdy mayne too). lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and stirba). lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania. the story isn't really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. sybil danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(i counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). i gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms. danning's contributions. yuck!

this film is really bad,so bad that even christopher lee cannot save it.a poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film,the outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch again.this garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material.

ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice, but he's approached by stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. so ben, his sister's best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil.this is incredibly awful b-grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released. it makes the original 'howling' look like a masterpiece. what was christopher lee thinking, as this has to be his worst performance i've seen.there was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film, ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie mcenroe, reb brown, marsha a. hunt and sybil danning (not to forgot lee), cheesy fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, the humour... if there was any, trashy 80s music (with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing), werewolf's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue. i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny, but i was wrong. the positives were the location and settings of the film looked great, but that's about it... actually i'll add sybil danning short stripping scene too.during the end credits the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film, which i beckon the question why?an awful piece of mess, however at least it isn't boring.1/5

ugly shot, poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dante's 1981 classic. "the howling" is one of the two or three only good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got 'rewarded' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one. if it's any consolation, "stirba" is a sequel in name only and there's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dante's film. the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by stirba. stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super-babe (with impressive bosom) in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused. her arch-enemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee. his character  stefan crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to stirba's kingdom, accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult. in case you're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity...this is your film. even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence. however, if you want a little substance or depth, you'll be sorely disappointed. the dialogues are embarrassing and there's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere. the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires (the transsylvanian setting, garlic, wooden stakes...) and danning's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film's only gimmick. during the end-credits, a shot in which she rips off her top, is re-edited repeatedly (according to my fellow reviewer dr. gore, no less than seventeen times!) which is pretty pathetic and pointless. the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful. i'm talking about the fierce-looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirba's castle. the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and  as far as i'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains "the beast within", released three years earlier.

a few years back the same persons who created paris,j'taime., which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7), created this piece of garbage about new york city.in paris, i love you (j'taime)created a feeling for paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful paris.in this current film, i did not recognize new york city, i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth.new york does have 5 boroughs,i saw no scenes in the bronx, or queens ,there is one scene in brooklyn,(brighton beach), i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village/ no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres. it does have a large cast,most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest sort.the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know & love.. a few of the films nominated for the 'razzie' awards were far better.ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) imdb 1 (out of 10)in my way of thinking i think the title should have beennew york, i hate you.

ok, as everyone has pointed out, this film is a complete dog. to some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised (or darkened down to near invisibility) to escape the censor's x-rating; but the film has many other flaws as well.to begin with, the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up. the baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires. now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick, you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. in fact the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie.secondly, the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen. anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically, yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy.there are a couple of slightly good bits. i actually quite liked the score. others have mentioned sybil danning's tits. and...(***spoiler***, if such a thing can exist)i also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold. there are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters. i mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? but in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthrope weapons.

dreadful horror sequel to "the howling". this picks off with karen white's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). stefan crosscoe (christopher lee sadly) arrives there and tells karen's brother ben (reb brown) that karen was a werewolf. he's going to transylvania to kill striba (sybil danning) the head werewolf. ben and a coworker of karens (annie mcenroe) join him.a terrible script, bad direction, inept editing and truly horrendous acting by brown and mcenroe single handedly sink this one. the werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark--for good reason! they're terrible when you see them. subpar special effects also--although i did like the cartoon lightning that comes from danning's fingers. there's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and danning takes off her top at least eight times during the closing credits! there are a few good things--i found the village in transylvania amusing--it looks like it came from a universal horror flick from the 1930s! there are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; brown and mcenroe have good bodies and lee and danning are good in this--but they can't save it. really--why did they do this? where that they hard up for money??? this is one of imdb's lowest rated movies. that alone should tell you something. supposedly danning was horrified when she saw the movie--i can understand why! a must-miss.

from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've got a stinker on your hands! this film had potential. beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film, if not an interesting one. the final product is a real mess, however. aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film. christopher lee gives it a nugget of credibility, but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap.having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one. we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves. the film is paced fairly well, and there are not too many dead spots. the action is there; it just isn't filmed well. one bright spot is the music of a punk band called babel. though their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy.the problems with this film are great in number. first off, the acting is worse than pitiful. christopher lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. the two leads reb brown and annie mcenroe are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters. the writing is wretched, the editing redundant, and the direction amateurish. there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks, but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number. sybil danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is less than satisfactory. judd omen looks the part he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least. much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be latin.i liked the general idea for the story. i always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil. one scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting. kind of. maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling. 3 of 10 stars.the hound.side note: as of this writing, the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with sybil danning ripping off her top several times while the babel song is playing! catch it while you can!

howling ii (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. whilst the first film was campy and creepy. the second one was sleazy and cheesy. the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. the "scene" from the first film was badly re-created. a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (reb brown) to the old country (romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba, the head werewolf of the romania. she also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww!bad movie. there's nothing good about this stinker. i'm surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker. the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content but the film stock itself). to round the movie off you get a lousy "punk" performance from a damned wannabe "babel". maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could've got the real deal instead of an imitation.best to avoid unless you're desperate or you lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel.

after watching this, i had lost a little respect for christopher lee (this has passed over time). this film was utter garbage. first, they tried to recreate the ending from the first "howling," with incredibly bad make-up. then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful!!!! a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (from the look of it, it was supposed to be dee wallace stone)teams up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by sybil danning, who seems to be naked all the time.this is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.). try to catch it on cable instead. it would be so chopped up, it may actually make sense.

the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field, oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason. he says "for it's written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood. and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written, behold i am the great mother of #an inaudible word i couldn't make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to, sorry# and all abominations of the earth". this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre. after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'los angeles, california u.s.a. city of the angels'. i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes. it's probably not too long after the events of the original howling (1981) and it's karen white's funeral. after the ceremony karen's brother ben (reb brown) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called stefan crosscoe (christopher lee) who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life. ben dismisses such nonsense. but together with one of karen's friends and colleagues jenny (annie mcenroe) he visits stefan at his home. there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed, he mentions stirba (sybil danning) who is the queen of werewolves. stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen's funeral of a woman named mariana (marsha a. hunt) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen. stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium. ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop stefan. however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan, ben and jenny. they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania. they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest, father florin (ladislav krecmer) and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters, hey what else can i call them? oh, and a dwarf named florica (ludmila safarova) helps too. they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba. but stirba knows of stefan's arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny. will stefan be able to put an end to stirba's plans for world domination? will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? watch it and find out. directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film. it's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring, unlike the original. something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. most people will probably hate it, but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them. there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry. the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i don't know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it doesn't look like what i thought mid 80's transylvania would. stirba's castle is part dungeon, part gothic castle and part modern luxury house. stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top, stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s/m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy, and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. the special make-up effects range from good to poor, a dwarf's eyes explode, someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore, although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks. there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves! i should also mention the music, the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down. acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! i wonder what he thinks of it. basically the whole thing is a real mess, but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage, it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times! if that's your thing.

absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! the acting, the dialog, the manuscript, the sound, the lighting, the plot line. i actually can't say anything positive about this, although i enjoy swedish movies. the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously. and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt, while dodging bullets in a strip bar, i'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke, or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film?! regina lund is the only half descent actor, but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions. it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this...

with the releasing of "farligt förflutet" swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom. stefan (jens hultén) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife marie (regina lund). one day an old friend of stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him. stefan is to do a small courier job. he is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the sweden-germany customs. unfortunately things in germany don´t work out as planned and stefan is now in big trouble. it is always nice to see a swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern. unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic. the content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs. the only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful regina lund. this lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure, let´s say what it truly is, crap.

following the success of "paris, je t'aime", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york. unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases. and, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together. as a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.sadly, however, while "paris, je t'aime" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of "new york, i love you" was miss. the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible. it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple. this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much--and i really wanted to love this film. i respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much.by the way, and this is not really a complaint, but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. for a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.also, if you get the dvd, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film. one consists of kevin bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog....and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy couple.

stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to marie. their marriage has been stable until stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. stefan's job is a heroin delivery from germany to sweden which should go easily.in germany stefan meet elli, a girl from bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help elli out of her misery. due to the fact that elli's father during the war fleed to sweden elli now goes with stefan to sweden. to make up with the past stefan promises elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. finally back in sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than stefan ever thought of..this movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it's been americanized alot. regina lund and cecilia bergqvist makes it all average, the effects makes the movie a little too much though. see it and jugde for yourself.

i view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year (if not ever, however i have not actually seen "quest of the delta knights" yet). this movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because i had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn't walk out.do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle. the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer.

major payne was really not very good at all. despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor. major payne's voice and temperament were especially annoying. the idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous. i would not recommend this film to anyone.

did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? wrong . this is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .it might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but i found damon wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . does he speak like that in real life ? if he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies

but there are not too many of them. probably the worst "major release" film i have seen in my life. definitely the worst for this year. there is no point in commenting on the plot, the cast or the acting. the problem is beyond all that. it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. i don't know why i gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. probably, because of steven martini. he really did try. bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells. avoid at any cost.

if this is someone's "favorite" movie, they need some serious help. there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. i haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of (some 1950s film), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization.a major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element, and winds up teaching children at an rotc school. unfortunately, the major is daman wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. can wayans whip these losers into shape? can they get him to become a little more human? the film bombs as most wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. william hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. this charming old man (known best to me as a "tales from the crypt" actor, known best to you as uncle louis from "christmas vacation") shines every moment he's on screen, which isn't much here.bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. i wouldn't mind slightly more bam bam, but i think he carried the role of "biker" about as far as it could be carried for a military film.and then there's the attractive teacher, who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. i'm not sure which (though it would seem "stupid" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough).wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 live crew. this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.seriously, avoid this film. if you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy "ernest goes to camp". at least he's a lovable loser, and actually funny. maybe if major payne had fought a badger i'd feel better, but he didn't. forget payne, forget wayans... you can do so much better.

sort of family parody blending "an officer and a gentleman", "heartbreak ridge", "full metal jacket" (and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now) into a rather dull movie, with some bright spots. the gags are always there where you would expect them, and damon wayans's lines are, well, predictable. as i said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you...

'major payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. this film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. the confrontation between major payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne. again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.

judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukor's film version of "born yesterday," and from that point forward, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again.it never happened. in "it should happen to you" (i can't think of a blander title, by the way), holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all, but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted. even jack lemmon, in what i believe was his first film role, can't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy. the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up.maybe if you're enamored of holliday you'll enjoy this; otherwise i wouldn't bother.grade: c

i think cliff robertson certainly was one of our finest actors. he has a half dozen classics to his credit. he does fine here as the heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome, it never gets off the mark. the story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself. still he mugs well and carries things along. the death knell is twofold. first of all, if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the movie. add to that, robertson's character sitting up in bed in the blue light, looking confused, that might add another chunk. i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent, though insignificant film. the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. i'm not putting in spoilers, but when it ends, don't think too much. i can come up with ten what-ifs without raising a sweat. it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story.

this movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. there are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again. there are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything. the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, & that is the reason why i rated it so low. it's watchable but don't expect anything great.

the character acting is a little stiff, as if it is the first time man of the actors have appeared on screen. unfortunately one of the better actresses, jean simmons (played many bit roles on tv, like in star trek tng and in the heat of the night), dies quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed.the lead role is mr ballard, as portrayed by cliff robertson. cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. he doesn't do a poor job, but it is a little overmuch to ask of an actor to plug the oceans of blank screen time during which the characters spend their time not talking and also not acting. robertson's most memorable role may have been ben parker in the last 3 spider man movies (starring tobey maguire).the plot is predictable. a husband murders his rich wife for her money. thereafter the wife seems to comeback and haunt the husband driving him insane until he leaps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) on the day he is predicted to die no less.the second chauffeur mr ballard hires looks a lot like an english mark hamill. uncanny really! the only thing that stands out is the utter disregard for dialogue. many minutes pass in quietness, no one speaks, and few act. it is a shame the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie. it could have been much better, if not just as predictable, with more dialogue, or shorter scenes of 'nothingness'.i kept expecting g'mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the "nothing" that inhabits this film.

to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight (1939 & 1944) via les diaboliques (1954); while still watchable in itself, it's so cliché-ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. however, thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - cliff robertson (as the conniving husband), jean simmons (in the title role), jenny agutter (as robertson's artist half-sister), simon ward (as the enigmatic chauffeur), ron moody (as an ill-fated doctor), michael jayston (as robertson's business partner), judy geeson (as simmons' best friend and jayston's wife), flora robson (as the housekeeper), david tomlinson (as the notary reading simmons' will) and, most surprisingly perhaps, jack warner (as a gravestone sculptor) - although most of them actually have nothing parts, i'm sorry to say!

cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling "dial it down; think zombie, only less lively" through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson's effort. the rest of the cast is barely better; jennifer agutter of logan's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. if the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark\lifetime tv channel crowd. as is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time. perhaps the late-night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.

i've seen all four of the movies in this series. each one strays further and further from the books. this is the worst one yet. my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "love's abiding joy." the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie, missie, henry, clark, scottie and cookie). the names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. the entire story line is no where in the book.i find it a great disservice to janette oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way. the music is too loud. the actors are not convincing - they lack emotions.if you want a good family movie, this might do. it is clean. don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. i hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but i doubt it. if there are more movies made, i wish michael landon, jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines. the books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!

:spoilers:i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy. i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re-aired thursday night on hallmark. i love the first three "love" movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be. the whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all.i think the script writers should have went more by the book. it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings. i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it. and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite. i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland. i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.

i rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. i don't think i ever finished it. it is worse than a home video made by a high school student. i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer suv, like a toyota rav-4 or something (i don't remember). i don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. he might have had a cell phone too, i cant remember, it was just horrible. i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back. to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen some pretty bad ones.

wow! i didn't know that someone would make this movie! its awful! i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie.number 1: "its the biggest rave ever" where is the that rave? i could only see a few people dancing around.. 2. when they are on the rave,they can only see blood everywhere,no people,two ruined tents and one stage.. and what do they do!? they drink!3.the worst actors i have ever seen! the captain and his crew.. awful! 4. when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun, he shoots almost 30 times without reloading! 5. i didn't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro! must be a new thing..i wonder what the producer was thinking! "this is going to be a big hit, its gonna be a classic" .. sure u dumb s**t anyway don't see this movie, its a waist of time. my eyes are still bleeding!

you know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious, thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? when you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? "house of the dead" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.from start to end "house of the dead" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. it is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude. i honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. uwe boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. at least then we'll get better acting however not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. it is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: "these are zombies, pure and simple" and "no cap'n, we must not go there! it's evil!".we all know that zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. trash, yes, but entertaining trash. not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. according to imdb, "house of the dead" received such bad reviews that no danish cinemas bought the movie. if only we could have had the same privilege.final score: 1/10.

i have watched some pretty poor films in the past, but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie. had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it.i am a fan of most genres and enjoy "shoot 'em up" games, but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable.as most have already said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak. i won't waste my time describing it.anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or sega, or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment.i must say, i was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumbs up, which led me to rent it. thank god i had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies.comic book guy would be right if he said "worst movie ever"!

this is the only film i've seen that is made by uwe boll, i knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that "house of the dead" is one of imdb bottom 100. but i still wanted to watch it because i'm a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. after watching it i do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. in the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing! the film is a true insult to the classic game, uwe boll please do not make any more films. thank you!

this movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be. one must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. it's camp, along the same lines as "army of darkness." aod was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. "house of the dead" fails to be "good bad.".there are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy. one needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. hotd lacks any believability.worse still, hotd brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. for example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. i don't know about you, but when i'm being chased by zombies, i wanna make out with a hot chick. believe it? no? then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, uwe boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities. avoid...

this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched. i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake, no, wait, i mean the the whole damn bakery. it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created. please just do yourself a favor, if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney, then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. in summation, i guess you really can call it a horror movie, but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.real rating, -10 disgusting

well, i had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. why? because i have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. it's unbelievably bad. just to let you in on how bad it is, i'll offer this little detail about the movie. during scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. yes, you heard me right. this movie really sucks. in fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. and to see corn filled crap like this? there is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. i'm really disappointed with this, knowing that i watched it. ok, i'm dumbstruck. it's so bad i can't even find the words. rating: zero out of *****.

i found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. from romero's 'dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' however upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.it is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. there is no horror here folks. just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're dvd player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. it's a pity. i think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.also what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. i've played the game. it sucks. so why did they put it in here? oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10rated r: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity

lynn hollister, a small-town lawyer, travels to the nearby big city on business connected with the death of his friend johnny. (yes, lynn is a man despite the feminine-sounding christian name. were the scriptwriters trying to make a snide reference to the fact that john wayne's birth name was "marion"?) hollister at first believes johnny's death to have been an accident, but soon realises that johnny was murdered. further investigations reveal a web of corruption, criminality and election rigging connected to boss cameron, the leading light in city 's political machine.that sounds like the plot of a gritty crime thriller, possibly made in the film noir style which was starting to become popular in 1941. it isn't. "a man betrayed", despite its theme, is more like a light romantic comedy than a crime drama. hollister falls in love with cameron's attractive daughter sabra, and the film then concentrates as much on their resulting romance as on the suspense elements.this film might just have worked if it had been made as a straightforward serious drama. one reviewer states that john wayne is not at all believable as a lawyer, but he couldn't play a cowboy in every movie, and a tough crusading lawyer taking on the forces of organised crime would probably have been well within his compass. where i do agree with that reviewer is when he says that wayne was no cary grant impersonator. romantic comedy just wasn't up his street. one of the weaknesses of the studio system is that actors could be required to play any part their bosses demanded of them, regardless of whether it was up their street or not, and as wayne was one of the few major stars working for republic pictures they doubtless wanted to get as much mileage out of him as they could.that said, not even cary grant himself could have made "a man betrayed" work as a comedy. that's not a reflection on his comic talents; it's a reflection on the total lack of amusing material in this film. i doubt if anyone, no matter how well developed their sense of humour might be, could find anything to laugh at in it. the film's light-hearted tone doesn't make it a successful comedy; it just prevents it from being taken seriously as anything else. this is one of those films that are neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. 3/10

really, i can't believe that i spent $5 on this movie. i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad. it had zombies in it right? was i wrong! to be honest the movie had it's moments...i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it. overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again. the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that. buyer beware...unless you are into masochism.

one wonders how the script came to be written.wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile. it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war. i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.nonetheless it has historical value.

all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. once you get that message, you may as well switch to another film.davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason. a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.the film is also interesting as documentation of jason schwartzman's fall from mount rushmore. in rushmore, schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome, but here it's his character's only quality. schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here's hoping his choices improve.

style but no substance. not as funny as it should be. not as deep as it wants to be.this is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. a young filmaker is hired to finish a campy 60s sci-fi movie called codename:dragonfly. think barbarella, or danger diabolique.but jeremy davies is an angst-ridden filmmaker. he's no hack he's an artist. the movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. hardly original.all the characters outside of jeremy davies filmmaker are as thin as rice-paper. characters that might be interesting, such as his father, his doppelganger, or jason schwarzmann as a hack director are introduced and then shown the door without adding a thing.this movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about filmmakers such as stardust memories or 8 1/2 it pales in comparison. those movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. those movies have lessons that apply outsidethe movie wants to be comic and campy but its just derivative and there is not one funny scene. the filmmakers describe it as a send-up but what's the satirical target? the actors say it's an homage but i think i would rather a full-length version of codename:dragonfly.coppola is clearly amused by the setting as is evident by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie within a movie. but he fails to share why we should be amused.outside of the sci-fi movie its just a mess. there are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after its already been chosen. what?just because he has a scene were the filmmaker is confronted by the critics complaining about the lack of story, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty cleverness does not mean that he has addressed those criticisms.i guess if your roman coppola you can get away with making a movie about an angst-ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and so ends up saying nothing. in that sense it may be considered autobiograhical.i would watch it at circuit city on a wall full of tvs if i had a choice. watch the 15-minute codename:dragonfly movies included on the dvd as extras and then send it back.

cq could have been good, campy fun. but it commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it's next to impossible to care where it's going. the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label: "caution: student film. fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker."

first of all, i too was expecting another hero--a fantastic work of art for the action genre. i've only seen parts of crouching tiger hidden dragon, but i can imagine that it is better than hofd.basic elements from hero are found in hofd: great landscapes, mesmerizing cinematography, and sincere acting (i mean, if you can't understand a word they are saying, without the subtitles, but you still care--that's good acting)what went wrong? what begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story. worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. you have three characters who, i guess, fall in love with each other- for no good reasons. this movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail (i fell asleep about forty minutes into it). it's almost as if they changed writers at that point. the remainder of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind." ick. also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces. this isn't unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for the action, and then, when the fighting does breaks out, it really wasn't that good. the beginning grabs you, but then this movie just runs out of gas.

after just 15 minutes into this film, i began to miss zhang yimou's earlier, more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of china from unique perspectives. his turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion. hero was his worst film since operation cougar, with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a john agar film. shi mian mai fu is no different. as an american who has been studying chinese films for a few years now (and understands and can speak some mandarin), i'm sure my opinion is different from many others as i'm coming from a different background. smmf, like hero, is not really a traditional a kung fu film, and it's certainly not a wuxia pian film. there are no sword & sorcery or chivalry elements here. this is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as a chinese ghost story (all 3), the butterfly murders, green snake, et al. while those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do, smmf features bland, and sometimes laughable, dialogue combined with cardboard acting. zhang ziyi plays a blind person about as well as ben affleck. there's an air of superiority with this film that's really quite insulting. it takes itself so seriously, it just becomes a huge joke by the end. all the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history, they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions, and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if zhang yimou was making a film per se, or simply a showcase (i.e. an "ego booster") for zhang ziyi. the camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film. her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive "w"itch. she's so concentrated on her acting, she comes across as cold and lifeless, as though she's reading her lines from a notecard. it's so funny to hear american critics and film people (like the completely clueless quentin tarantino) call this film a masterpiece. i guess if they see a bunch of asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest, they're tricked into thinking it's brilliant film-making. ching siu tung's choreography, while still retaining his trademark style, editing, and postures, lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like a chinese ghost story, dragon inn, and duel to the death. sadly to say, the wirework in this film is really subpar, and if there's subpar/obvious wirework, then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed. the same goes for the special effects which have a distinct b-movie feel to them. beans, daggers, bowls, arrows, swords, and other random objects fly through the air (after being thrown) with no regard for logic, turning, climbing, and banking as though there's a little pilot inside. i know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized chinese martial arts films, but if you don't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience, then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more. mass melodrama, unintentionally funny dramatic moments, boring fight scenes, really uninspired plot twists are what await you with shi mian mai fu. it's obvious that zhang yimou is no longer making movies for chinese audiences. this is meant to crack into the western market just as cthd did. after watching hero and smmf, i've come to the conclusion that if zhang yimou wants to make hollywood films, he's definitely off to the right start. smmf is basically the phantom menace of chinese martial arts films. and i thought hero was bad.

as someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of "hero," i was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines, but better. it also featured an actress i like: ziyi zhang. well, i was disappointed on both counts. i bought the dvd of this film sight-unseen, and that was a mistake. it was not better.i realize these flying-through-the-air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief. a blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? sorry, that's going a little far. also, the major male character 'jin" (takeshi kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialog, stupid look on his face and stupid laugh, that he ruined the film, too.despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - to me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning. this film is no "hero" of mine!

i was very surprised how bad this movie was. nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. i was hoping for a rerun of hero, but this is much, much worse.this movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. no believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story twists.this movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. every time you think your silly battle makes some sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ("ah ha, you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns, but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns don't work and i'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity plus one.") children can continue with this lunacy, because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. however, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas.spoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, which has a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a fake prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient china where there isn't a kaiser permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations.in any event, go watch hero again, because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible.

normally, i am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad. i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.there were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. it might have worked if "daggers" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. there is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. this may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, i was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly i just cringed a lot.*******spoiler*****now, the icing on the cake. or rather, adding insult to injury. the ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones i have ever seen. the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. oh, and then it starts to snow. randomly. oh, and then mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. wow, cool.well, then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. i, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. not a good sign.visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.

i gave this a 1. there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. total mayhem. everyone gets killed or nearly so. i am tired of cross hairs and changing views. i cannot give the plot away. convoluted and insane. if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back. i wish reviews were more honest.

the banner says it all, this is one really bad movie, which is sad because i normally like sheffer, and i have been impressed with andrea roth in other roles. this, however, is terrible. i wont waste any more time...its just that bad.

while i watched this movie, i tried to figure out why they bothered making it. though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated/unnecessary subplots. the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double-crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. it's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the president and his mistress. the many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - i really didn't feel like i knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. the ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be. in the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross. i'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.

spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made. probably in the style of ed wood(without the heart). the lightning is terrible. the music is very bad(piano and orgue... come on!). the acting is... well there is no acting!there's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.the killer is a fat, unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort.the end is so far the most stupid ever made. think about it: the guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this flop) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them... on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.the tragedy is that mr.hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co-worker goes missing...whatever.

spoilers ahead if you want to call them that...i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10. where to begin, we'll start from the top...the story: don't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are. it's a draub, basic, go to cabin movie with no intensity or "effort".the screenplay: i usually give credit to indie screenwriters, it's hard work when you are starting out...but this is crap. the story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie. the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of "woah, you totally freaked me out" and "i was wondering if you'd uh...if you'd like to..uh, would you come to the cabin with me?". it makes me want to rip out all my hair, one strand at a time and feed it to myself.the characters: holy crap!!!! some have described the characters as flat, i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch.. they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards...the actors: worse than the characters are the actors. they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting. the "woah you totally freaked me out" was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down. i could complain for hours on the actors alone.technical: lighting: an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie. too shadowy in areas, too bleached in others. the director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly. baby steps! sound: how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie? 9. with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured. there is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle....weak! camera: learn to use it.anyway, i'm running out of complaining space.....rent it - i dare you...rent it and learn from it...give it a 1 rating..it deserves it.signing off... amanda christmas

this movie is just horrible. it's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it's hilarious.the "main" actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's.all the characters are away for the week-end for a get together amongst friends, but nobody are actually friends! the married couple hasn't seen the "main" guy in over 5 years and even back then they weren't really friends. the "date" of the main guy only knows him from work and than there's a girl they pick-up at a bar. now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week-end at your cabin with people that aren't even your real friends. because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie!do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon. i've made home movies scarier than this!

i am writing this review having watched it several months ago....the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. it is a complete joke....and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like texas chainsaw massacre (1974) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art. the producer who played brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers....hell he might not even be good at that either! the lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes. i don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really, bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. that's all the time i will waste on this review please stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least it would keep you entertained!if you want good quality low budget fun, far better than this... then check out a jeff hayes film....because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!i gave this 1 star just for the cover art....thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called "film"-rick blalock

i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but this is without a doubt the worst one ever! i usually like dumb movies, if they are somewhat entertaining, but i can't even think of one good thing about this movie. i like "teen witch" for heaven's sake. but s.i.c.k. has horrible acting, lame porn music throughout the whole thing, and even the sex scenes sucked! i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of "twin dragons", "puppet master vs the demonic toys" or even "a very brady sequel". although, this is by far worse then any of those. i beg you, don't even waste your time. believe me, its 2 hours you'll never get back.

me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. but we were wrong. first of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a film a college kid made. the plot was pretty good, but it'd been done. the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors. the main guy was the worst actor ever...it's a shame i'm even calling him an actor...the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one. i usually love b list movies and such, but this one... i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video...this one is the worst i've seen..and i've seen some bad ones.

this film is the worst excuse for a motion picture i have ever seen. to begin, i'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. in fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on google and thought it looked cool. speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... i mean seriously wtf??? how is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? i bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? wrong! the next day i gave it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named s.i.c.kbottom line is: don't see this film!!!

i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night. all i can say to describe this worthless film is 'trash' the acting is so badly done i've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they're just reading their lines out, no feeling, no emotion, and no room to capture the viewer. on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack.the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover. heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters. there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've questioned a few things 1. if is 'serial insane clown killer' wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills clowns? 2. if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her? sad really.3. why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden? did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs? this film is as sad as they come. my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.

this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life, and i've seen some pretty bad movies. i didn't like the way this movie was filmed. all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. i've never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming. the story is too weird. i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, don't. you're just wasting your time.

this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen. i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie. in fact, when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. they are always good for a laugh, believe i know, i have seen many. but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle. i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes... which i probably should have. there is nothing good about it, first and foremost, the camera crew suck3d a$$. the intro was stupid just like the ending. acting and special effects were terrible. please i'm begging you, do not watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.

well...overall, this movie was pretty much worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy. i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie. this definitely wasn't what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor. the actors in this movie (especially brandon) are so fake that it's funny. and especially that tracy girl whenever she's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away. they show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting. and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark, he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him. and seriously, would you just be jogging if you were being chased down? i'd be sprinting for my life! (even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he's like 300 lbs.) not to mention that the effects aren't that great, like whenever the clown chops off susan's head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over. also like in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i don't even see why it was even included in the movie. so what, was this movie made in 2003? the music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's, and the camera-ing(?) doesn't even really look professional. half of the time, it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be. overall, i'd have to say i enjoyed the movie. i wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of, i'd recommend it for sure.

this movie was so bad! it was terrible! it was awful! i cannot stress it enough! the acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it was bad! it was so corny and clichéd. don't be fooled by the cover, or the tag line "the 'texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at." are you frogging' kidding me! it was ridiculous.the first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character brendan, ok now turn it off. what i got from the film was, a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and fake ways.this movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of your money and time too! i fast forward through most of the movie because it was so terrible, i just wanted to see how each bad actor died, and it still wasn't worth it! just looking at the cover is a waste of time. this is seriously the worst movie ever! rating: doesn't deserve one.

ok, so i rented this clown-like-chainsaw-massacre-esquire film, not expected much, but i did like the novel approach to a serial killer film. (from the back of the box is the following synopsis) "at first, it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the texas woods. but when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. but he's out there. and he's sick. and all he wants is blood..." so obviously from the get-go it doesn't make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? why a clown? why are their dolls with the word "food" drawn on them? why why why? hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives. the characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. one in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. what warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? she, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.the music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. there was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1-store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.i had to give the film a 3. it was an interesting premise (clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character, essentially) and i'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could've totally been a b-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. but ultimately, i probably would've felt like renting the killer klowns from mars video again before going back to check this out. ah, but that cover art...pretty awesome drawing.

i bought this from blockbuster for 99p. the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video. talking of home videos, since when has it been fair game to release them as films - i mean to say, films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame-o ideas together for the weekend, lavish the production with an £8.00 budget, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap (me), to take home in lonely desperation. but here's the clincher - i fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammers... until the next night, while watching a darren day horror 'hellbreed' (£1.99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster). now this film made 'grim weekend' look like the exorcist, so i slapped grim weekend back on, to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards, that viewers claimed were hilarious. sure enough, once i had got over the misery, the pain, and the horror, of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast, i could enjoy, savour, and downright get down to the funny stuff. and there's a lot of it. check the boards. then check the flick. hell, it might even be worth it. awwwww crap!

although i had heard this film was a little dry, i watch whatever scott bakula is in. at the start of this film i had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable scott-gets-girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great. the plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever. i kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding, right up until when the credits rolled and i realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending. unfortunately i was left regretting that i'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott!

although this isn't a "great film," there's something compelling and memorable about it. like another commenter on the film, i saw this in childhood. it's been thirty three years since 1952, but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. see it if you have the opportunity. you'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades. more than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century "progress." it's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. furthermore, it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time.

this low-grade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but, intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession, i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release. which is just as well, since the end result was not anything particularly special (if decently atmospheric at that): for starters, the plot is pretty weak  even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood (1973)albeit without any of that film's campy gusto. what we have here, in fact, is a penniless sculptor (martin kosleck)  whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat!  who, upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan napier's vitriolic pen one time too many, decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river. however, while contemplating just that action, he is anticipated by rondo hatton's escaped killer dubbed "the creeper" and, naturally enough, saves the poor guy's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude! although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york, all we really see at work is kosleck and commercial painter robert lowery (who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl joan shawlee over and over in banal poses  how is that for art?) who, conveniently enough, is engaged to a rival art critic (virginia grey) of napier's! before long, the latter is discovered with his spine broken and lowery is suspected; but then investigating detective bill goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of lowery's work (i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed!!) so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be! in the meantime, kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting hatton's uniquely craggy  and recognizable  visage which, needless to say, attracts the attention of the constantly visiting grey (we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column)much to the chagrin of both artist and model. bafflingly, although the creeper is fully aware of how grey looks (thanks to her aforementioned haunting of kosleck's flea-bitten pad), he bumps off shawlee  who had by then become goodwin's girl!  in lowery's apartment and, overhearing kosleck talking to (you guessed it) grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police, sends the slow-witted giant off his deep endeven down to destroying his own now-completed stony image. curiously enough, although this was hatton's penultimate film, his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet "introducing"!

this is a typical late universal horror flick: its technically comptent, if by the numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. the most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of rondo hatton, a man with a bone disease as the film's "monster". its sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped, as i more often felt pity over fear or even loathing. martin koslack is on board as the film's mad artist, and he is very amusing in this part. i for one enjoy seeing koslack in just about anything; for some reason the man amuses me. the only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd take on the art world. here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the film's male "hero" who is an "artist" who paints...get this...pin up girls. somehow our hero's work is reviewed side by side with the villan's absurdist sculpture. also amusing is the film's chief nasty critic, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's pin up art because "women like that don't exist" to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough. finally, there's a bit of a subplot about the heroine's (who is an art critic herself) domestication by the leading man....completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness. overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements.

the peculiar charisma of martin kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist. he imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism, making the sculptor marcel a convincing individual. the character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical b movie villain.the story line is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are dull. what makes it work is the strange chemistry between kosleck and rondo hatton as the creeper. kosleck's talkative, philosophical character is contrasted with hatton's low key, monosyllabic approach. the character of the creeper isn't developed much beyond a basic monster level, but hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story.this movie was on shock theater a lot when i was a kid, so i have a certain nostalgic fondness for it. it's worth seeing once, anyway, for those who enjoy forties horror movies.

this documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation. there is no denying the grinding poverty in india and desperation of even their wealthier clients. however, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably. although indian clients mention having seen "aleopathic" doctors, those doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- "the doctor said there was no cure," "the doctor said it was cancer" etc. well, "no cure" doesn't mean "no treatment," and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have? the film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in america. there it is reduced, apparently, to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered wall street job can make your stomach hurt.

it's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions. at times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans, even lying about how they don't charge their clients. while they are wearing their gold watches, the 'donation' box is mandatory. notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases.keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee, while the average salary in india is 1,700 ru/month.

while watching this movie i got sick. i have been grewing up with pippi and every time was a real pleasure. when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh. but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again. it is terrible from beginning to it's end. how can they manage to make it soo bad. well i guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha.. but they are never close to pippi. may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast. burn the movie and save the kids. if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh. we love pippi inger nilsson, sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi.. oh yes.. when read the "spoilers" explanation, "'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film." well i guess the director stands for this... you are looking at this movie at your own risk.. it is really a waste of time...

this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988. it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier, and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture. i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this.

this is another north east florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to fernandina beach and the kingsley plantation. i was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of fernandina beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. the film is pretty, and pretty bad. tami erin is cute, but overacts. eileen brennan overacts even more. good for small kids, or for those who like fluff in large doses. a 4 from the miller-movies formula.

this movie . . . i don't know. why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin, i will never know. why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, i will never know. why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned such bad songs, why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, children's film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren's creation.

the last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks. like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly. mona, the lazy, sullen, and drug-addicted title character, is not likable and bonnaire does little to make her interesting. although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. the episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time. it is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men.

mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of french society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction.i watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but i'm afraid i must have missed something. the character of mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. she's not interesting or exciting. she's just useless.i've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. they are just lazy bums. i wouldn't want mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. lots of junkies, winos and bums i've seen are enigmatic; i wouldn't want to see a film about them either.possibly there is something there that i totally missed. otherwise i'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art.

because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story, without having to listen to banal dialogue, and be finished in 10 minutes max. come to think of it, even 10 minutes is too much to waste on enid-blyton-meets-struggling-wanna-be-artists. vomit.

very bad movie........and i mean very bad...the plot is predictable, and it's eally cheesy, the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one, other than that...this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch.....i feel while watching the movie, the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché....bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah, but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy, very poorly portrayed from idea to screen, i think. the plot is somewhat predictable at times, tho the dancing i can say at times, is pretty good, the break dance battle twist was good.....if u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5...lol

mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same year's the public enemy. she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood's girl who finds that her past will always be with her.in some ways, this looks a bit antique for 1931, almost as if you are looking at 1928's famously inert lights of new york. but don't be fooled. although ted tetzlaff's photography is still in the big scenes, there's lots of movement, indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set-ups to them. but in competition with the fast-paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at warner's, this attempt to bring the woman's viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker doesn't work, nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort.

the "trivia" page on imdb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re-cut by the studio to "simplify the plot". if so, that effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most incoherent narratives i've ever seen in a film -- i'd hate to have seen it before the plot was "simplified."it's sad to see warren with so little character to go on that even he can't do anything with the inept material. it's interesting to see caron in '70s mode instead of her hollywood-era glamour garb and persona, but it's sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing-a- favor-to-her-producer-husband dreck. she would actually later hook up with and marry the director, instead -- who, you'll note, never directed anything again, but did strictly 1st or 2nd a.d. work in tv from here on out. that oughta tell you enough right there.i call this "interesting" because i have an automatic fondness for american films of this period, and this role does add perspective to oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 output (two- lane blacktop, the hired hand). but the "1940s detective as fish-out-of-water in 1970s l.a." theme, which is the only thing the movie really has to say, is sold in way too heavy- handed a manner. a similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in altman's the long goodbye. and as far as oates playing a hard-bitten guy on a doomed errand, three years on, he would give his definitive performance in bring me the head of alfredo garcia. if you haven't seen those, don't waste your time with this!

in the many films i have seen warren oates, i have come to a definite conclusion, here is one talented individual. i first saw mr. oates back in the 1960's television series called stoney burke. from then on, i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. that happened in 1974, when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called 'bring me the head of alfredo garcia.' of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'the wild bunch'. i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic, that is until i saw him in this flop. the movie is called " chandler ", a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950's created by raymond chandler. because, the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye, i was immediately interested. however, i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull, dis-interesting, slow pace, twisted, confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self. collectively and with some of hollywood's best supporting stars, such as alex dreier, mitch ryan, gordon pinsent, charles mcgraw, richard loo and scatman crothers, this movie had enough power to reach mach five, however, it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where. as a result, one of my favorite actor's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground. **

i saw this film when it was first released. the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years. i didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it, so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent, indecipherable, and uninspiring. a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron's husband, thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film. the film's roster of many capable actors - caron, warren oates, scatman crothers, gloria grahame, and james sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise. but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay. the "mystery" implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene. the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller, but never settles upon one or the other. the sense of suspense is entirely absent. the main characters settle on playing dry, emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever. the cinematography is pedestrian. the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and, in the end, the film itself. i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase. i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4:00 am slot.

former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. his assignment: to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. director and co-scenarist paul magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his "chandler" was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. the handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and warren oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie doesn't have any snap. nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. vivid cinematography by alan stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from ****

according to imdb, as well as to every other website that holds a review; this "thing" doesn't have a director. well, that would surely explain a lot! just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium. "hardgore" is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut, as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration. horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well, so why not combine the two? here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who's committed to a mental asylum, and from the first night already, she's drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. really, a lot of dildo-action. the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat slit even the same night. the horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated, going from laughably un-scary satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks. the photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs? leading lady justina lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (male & female) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls.

the number of goofs in this episode was higher than the first 9. they don't follow their own rules about spirits where destruction of the body makes the spirit dissolve. this one dropped a second body. that body, and dean, drop about 20 feet from sam but then they are right with sam. flashlights go out in an unlighted asylum, at night, and we can still see everything. it's night but light is streaming through the windows. a ghost that died in 1960's is making cell phones calls? come on! there is no way sam could get a psychiatrist to see him in the same day he makes an appointment and the doctor talks to sam like it wasn't his first visit. sam and dean knew there were other bodies in the asylum and innocent spirits still lurking and didn't do anything to help them. that doesn't seem like a thing the winchester boys would do. oh and after crawling around on a dirt filled mattress and all around a nasty asylum the girls' makeup and hair is perfect and not a smudge on her white shirt. while the implementation of this episode had problems the premise was good and a few times i was not creeped out but nervous as dean sat reading elicots' journal. i just knew that an object so intensely personal to the ghost would draw it to the person violating it's sanctity. elicot didn't appear. maybe that is a fault for such an important object or place (like elicot's office) should draw the spirit when a living being touches or enters. when they separate i want to scream... 'that's how you die! always stay together and watch each others backs!' but they don't listen to me :o the elicot spirit and his special ability was a very nice touch. it's prime-time show but i do wish the horror of elicot strapping one of his victims down and using anticipation of torture to creep us out further.especially because of the lighting goofs i gave this a 4. sudden darkness or the flickering of the whole scene's lighting as the flashlight flickers is all that more terrifying. the lighter coming or the flashlight reviving and instantly a spirit is in their face is shocking. i understand the directors wants us to see his scene but then make a mention or obvious connection by elicot touching an electric socket and the lights coming on. have the characters respond to the fact an asylum with no power suddenly has lights in the one room. blue white lights flickering as electric arcs just like elicot's finger power. seriously, mcg could have done better.

my kids picked this out at the video store...it's great to hear liza as dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom. but there are too many bad songs, and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time.

...and ethel merman buffs, too, will love her loud, bossy vocals as the wicked witch mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "the wizard of oz" is bereft of real imagination, substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action (and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video). little dorothy is whisked back to oz, which has gone to ruin, and meets old and new friends. the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less-inspired shows from hanna-barbera, however many of the songs are good, particularly dorothy's sweet lament "it's a far away land", superbly performed by liza minnelli. you can count on minnelli for energy, which is why the movie perks up whenever dorothy is around. much of it is unmemorable, and i'm not even sure baby-boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long. as a curiosity item, just fair. ** from ****

really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. but actor clayton moore (the movie lone ranger) acquits himself competently as an actor. he's the only one.a rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern california as "the moon" (again and again and again), and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it's clear that it isn't--no humor here, except unintentionally.the dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes . . . well, enough said. plot? what plot? bad guy (well, head bad guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called krog (listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a spoof on the name of mcdonald's founder ray kroc)and his unbelievably inept gunsels (who, however, have handguns that never need reloading; as does commando cody, so there are numerous firefight standoffs).enjoy.

oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952! this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes (from misery). not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and that couldn't possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump), but i think this serial has the world's record of stock footage. i mean, most of it is stock footage! and not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men, and the cool "molten rocks" scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel), but from itself! the whole "trip to the moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes! (ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? well, they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again!).don't get me started on the science factor. prepare to see the sunniest moon ever! and moon men that can not breathe on their own world? what were they smoking? and if this is not enough, it's too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in serials) are few and far. visually-wise, am i the only one who thinks that commando cody's bullet-shaped (or is it lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous-looking? the rocketeer's was way cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, was it awful). the tank-like vehicle isn't much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween. the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!), but then he's so unappealing...not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake. see captain marvel instead. 2/10.(btw, check out the memorable quotes section for a real women's lib pearl).

this serial is interesting to watch as an mst3k feature, but for todays audience that's all it is. i was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952. considering that fact alone makes this a solid (lowly?) 2 in my book. the cars used don't even look contemporary, they look like stuff from the 30's. it's basically cody (the lone world's salvation? sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else, like the military), anyway it's cody in his nipple ring flying suit against graber and daley two dumb*ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right, enjoy. if you want to watch a really good serial see flash gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women, this has none of that. and flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack. something made in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. nuff said. give it a 6 if your watching it as a mst3k episode, those guys have some good fun with it; a tweak of the nipples here, a tweak there and i'm flying! and now as an added bonus, i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character bots tom servo and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet:(singing at the very beginning credits);(tom servo singing) your watching commander cody.... he is the new character from republic,he gets in trouble every week... but he's saved by editing,just a tweak of his nipples... sends him on his way,a pumpkin head and a rocket pack.... will save the day,(joel singing) his labratory is a boxing ring... when bad guys come to mix it up,somebody always gets kidnapped... and cody has to fix it up,he drinks his tea at al's cafe... and flies along on wires,he beats the crooks and flies with hooks... and puts out forest fires,(crow singing)bad guys beware... cody is there,you'll like his hair it's under his helmut... and because we can't think of a good rhyme,that's the end of the commander cody theme song... so sit right back with a will of granite,and watch chapter eight, cause that's the enemy planet

the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials. the special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them, and the like. the acting is only so-so. it does inspire the imagination of children, to whom i believe this was directed to. by today's standards, it's boring, cheap, and bad. there's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.

i saw most of the episodes of rmftm as a teenager on "cliffhanger theater" running after midnight on a local station some years ago, and then again when mystery science theatre riffed on it in the early 90's. time has not been kind to it. i can certainly make allowances for the special effects, which were quite impressive for a low budget 50's serial (imo commando cody's flying scenes were better than george reeves/superman's in his tv show). and i can also make allowances for the ahem, "acting", and fight choreography -. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the moon men. he is incredibly miscast. he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. even the corny dialog works all right - everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers, with no wasted time or pauses for things like "thought" or "introspection". since everyone does this, the viewer finds it immersive after awhile, and even to my modern sensibilities, it doesn't bother much. what really irritates me is the writing and the plotting. i'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda powered rocket ships, or a flying suit that has controls labeled "up/down" and "fast/slow". i'm not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter. i'm talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train, the plot goes through the same motions again and again. dig it: commando cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth (or at least the usa) against an insidious alien invasion. but his office has no guards or security checkpoints. they don't even have locks on the front doors. so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff ...not once (perhaps understandable) but several times. they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try. and they never get any smarter. to further prove my point, allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone. he does this over and over and over. cody also flies his ship to the moon (the woman assistant comes along to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. cody captures one of the atomic ray guns...and immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldn't be bothered to lock it up. and so on.and you would think that if cody's efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men, that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines, a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up, instead of just working with the local police all the time. this was supposed to be a military operation, but they act like it's another episode of "gangbusters". it's all rather hard to stomach. i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraints...and i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre (even though he loses half of his fistfights). but i just can't help yelling "door! lock the doooor!!" when the gangsters simply walk into his lab, or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in place...not even a fence (!). still, it's ok. of the three republic serials i've watched, "phantom creeps" had a better plot, and "undersea kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) and a better hero than "radar men", but it's an ok time-waster. btw...why "radar" men? they didn't use radar, they used atomic ray guns. shouldn't the title have been "atomic ray gun men from the moon?"

...at least during its first half. if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes, it would have been a much better and tighter film. the second half of the film is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it's like a dull toothache getting there. also, don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it. she has an important role, but it's a small one.the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of sally (ginger rogers), a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. world war i breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle, yet enlist in the navy anyways. the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (bill boyd as baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets). to make matters more complex, sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.the film is a little more interesting on board ship, mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. however, james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby, especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design, or, i should say, the lack of it. in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.in conclusion, if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission, you've seen everything here worth seeing. the rest is padding.

don't even waste your time, let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck! how it got made is beyond me. (i don't know why there's a minimum of 10 lines... i've already summarized this trashy movie, but, oh well...) the acting was awful, like they all needed lessons. the plot was weak, the ending... feh! i think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck... well, maybe the sound was minimalistically ok. the one good thing is, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea. so, you-all take heart! i guess the same holds true of actors... if these people actually got paid, then you can, too!

i was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover. alas. it is easily one of the worst movies ever made. judging by the acting of the film characters, it's more a comedy than a horror film. no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb. avoid it.

if i have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then i have to give it a low score 3/10.but it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie.the psychiatrist candidate james bishop is assigned to st. andrews hospital for his resident, and is exited and eager to "change the world".from the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but james thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil. the story builds fairly well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil, and wonder when and how james will discover this. also when the break comes, james is in a way hunted by the evil, and you feel some suspense until "the fight" is over.add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture.the character buildup is actually fairly good, you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed, some of them you "get to know".the film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done fairly well. there are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.the main character, james is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.what kills this movie is: * stupid special effects - a modern version of "plan 9 from outer space"-type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * some bad acting (or probably very few takes when filming) - the main characters sometimes acts badly, and somtimes good. * the sound is at times very cheap.i kept thinking "i could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the film.

because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot, i'd like to mention a few points about this film. there may be spoilers here; i don't care enough to filter them out.- given the film's low budget, the creature design was quite good. it's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror film that's not slathered with awful cgi. unfortunately the digital film quality's quite grainy in places, and it's most noticeable in the well-lit white halls of the asylum.- ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film, to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time. i understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established. as-is, it merely seems amateurish.- plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable. i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists, nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil-trumps-good development would surface at the end.- this may seem like quibbling, but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense. first of all, regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest-induced. why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies? why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? what's the background? what's supposed to make us care about anyone in this? and just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency? this film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt.bottom line: see the wicker man instead.

hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop (matt stasi) takes up his residency at st. andrews insane asylum, or 'mental illness facility' as they like to call it there. with nearly 600 patients bishop meets his boss dr. mccort (bruce payne) & is put to work, he gets ward 'a' where some seriously deranged & dangerous patients are held. if that wasn't bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body & has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room. bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings-on at the asylum & soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them...known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j. jones & i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it. the script by matt mccombs takes itself pretty seriously & i quite liked the basic idea behind & some of it's ideas but there are a few things which work against it. for a start the film is just too slow, the story is pretty good & doesn't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going & i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute. i also thought the so-called twist ending was far too predictable & the ending itself far too bland & forgettable. it's a shame because i liked the story, the character's, the setting & some of the ideas but it's simply too slow & frankly dull to keep one entertained over it's 90 minute duration. it's one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i can't.director jones does a good job, this is actually a well lit & quite atmospheric film. i wouldn't say there's anything scary here. i'm not sure if hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets & the film looks pretty good overall. unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action, there are two hand-print shaped wounds & a severed tongue & that's it, absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment. depending on who you believe & which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good, well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive & is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although it's an impressive suit. it all depends on your expectations i suppose.technically the film is good, it looks nice enough & the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome. the acting isn't great though, it certainly could have been better.hellborn is a film that disappointed me, there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good. i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience i'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone.

the cast although nothing special, all do an ok job, the story seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist; so what's wrong with it?for a start the special effects are really bad (if this was made in the 60's) it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this. it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly 'from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers'.secondly the direction is weak, this film just does not capture the essence of the story, a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil (or demon type creature) should be tense or frightening; it simply isn't.all in all this is a pretty poor film, and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining, it is still probably best left alone.a rather sad 4/10

i've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time, and while this isn't the worst of the bunch, it's certainly in the lower half. the script starts off ok. a young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife. cute huh? the movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients. turns out that there's a demon on the basement that's harvesting people's souls. it's the job of the 1 doctor, 1 nurse, and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs, do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out, and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects. at this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid, i was begging for it to be over. there was still an hour to go. it looked like a half an hour "tales from the crypt" episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap-fest. from tiny lister doing his best john coffey (the green mile) impersonation to tracy scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid nurse ratchet, this movie fails in every possible level. i gave this 2 stars for only two reason. 1) his fiancé is pretty hot, she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2) the movie actually looks ok, a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal-mart quality home cameras.in the end, avoid this turd even if you have the blockbuster movie pass (which i do, and i still felt cheated). as a bonus drinking game, you and your buddies take a shot every time matt stasi (dr. james bishop) shakes his head while talking. you'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie.

in theory, films should be a form of entertainment. while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film-making; most movies, specially genre films, must not only tell it's story or message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low-budget, a bad movie is one that is boring."hellborn" or "asylum of the damned" as is known in the u.s., is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving, and irremediably boring and tiresome. while it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesn't make things better. on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b-movie, but here it is just a bad attempt at film-making.director philip j. jones tells the tale of james bishop (matt stasi), a young psychiatry resident, who just got his dream job at st. andrew mental hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, james decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of his boss, dr. mccort (bruce payne), who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients.while the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired. in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre. of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés; but in "hellborn" every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline.the acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception: bruce payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting. matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances.despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about "hellborn"; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget hollywod "horror" productions. also, the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. sadly, the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics."hellborn" is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results. hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience. 3/10

this is complete and absolute garbage, a fine example of what a bad movie is like, this can't be appealing to anyone, not even b-movie fans. do not, i repeat, do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash. bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but i mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is. i bought the dvd for 3 dollars, i swear i could almost pay someone to take it. burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. i like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? not even. just plain old pathetic.

this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. it's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. however, what i found hard to take about the film was that although anja schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. this whole lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. another thing i found odd was that neither beart nor schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least.

the storyplot was okay by itself, but the film felt very bubbly and fake. it also had the worst ending. they were probably going for a surprise ending, but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was. all other teen movies are better than this one.

sugar &spice is one of the worst movies of 2001. the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails . when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. i've heard that the dvd has a director's cut maybe i'll check it out, but this pg-13 trash movie is s*** and the worst kind of s***. maybe if the film had some t&a that would've have made it okay. but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. worse than a troma film.

i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv. i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7:40. i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better. the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. they exaggerated the way love works in reality. all of the girls were stereo types. the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts. hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any. so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.

i can't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. i laughed a couple of times. ( probably because of how stupid it was ) if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn't. the plot was so horrible , it made no sense , and the acting was so bad that i couldn't even tell if they were trying. that movie was terrible rating: f

i tried to watch this movie three separate times. the night i rented it. got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if i had a night's rest. watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how stupid it was... it wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s (if you know what i mean in the censored world we live in). and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn't enjoy one single moment! not even one. how did this script get greenlighted. oh boy!g1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork.

please, spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother, plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek-brand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie "feel" cool and, we have intensely and painfully inept satire.this isn't even watered-down 'ferris bueller'...i'd rather watch a traffic light change.only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission: when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend. it's a surreal moment. priceless even.but for the rest of it, i'd rather have a toothache. at least i can apply some benzocaine(tm) to stop the pain.

ok, i have watched the original french version. but i can't imagine this being better with subtitles.all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time. there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film. that's why i can't understand all the positive reviews. it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. tarkovsky's solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. but in this case, the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters. none of which i could identify with or care for. in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking: "when are they going to shut up"? the acting was pretty bad. not in an overacting obvious kind of way. but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given. also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. going from one scene to the next. it seems this movie was just written (badly) but never directed.this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes. no suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what so ever.a perfect example of what i call an anti-movie.

frank sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (arthur kennedy), now the town big-shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. frank gets involved with gambler dean martin, uneducated flooze shirley maclaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. over-simplified drama verging on soap opera, with a role for maclaine that is by turns overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken belting on "after you've gone" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). director vincente minnelli oversees it in straight-forward fashion, but he's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. the picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from ****

vincente minelli movies are usually worth your time; meet me in st louis, the bad and the beautiful. i awaited this movie with great interest. but what a disappointment. some came running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism. sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hanging on him, living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and macclane and something disappointing happens. the sequence is intended to be tension-filled but minelli is no hitchcock; he gets so distracted by pretty colors, he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot. (especially macclane) but that's the only real cinematography in the project. otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours. hell is other people, apparently.there is nothing going on in this movie. the dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after ww2 is handled more deftly in 'the best years of our lives.' and either of two inge products, 'splendor in the grass' and 'picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town, with much more poignance.

poor performances by sinatra, martin and hyer. grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. annoying talky with no real plot. ending leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters). maclaine is the only real asset. that penultimate sequence in which the "chicago hood" searches for the sinatra character is laughable. the music in that sequence also is poor. and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a "pig," almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen.

but i doubt many were running to see this movie. or "some came running out of the cinema". okay, that's a bit harsh.the film starts in an unintentionally comical way: frankie-boy comes back to his hometown after many years (this already smells of clichés) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival: he is talked about, everyone wants to talk to him, and every woman he meets flirts with him like there's no tomorrow - even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie-boy a little longer! even his pretty niece wants a piece of him! sounds like one of those laughable "mike hammer" episodes where every single female wants stacey keach. and, like stacey keach, frankie-boy is anything but a good-looking woman's wet dream. in real life, someone like sinatra (without the fame) wouldn't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as maclaine. but in this hollywood movie it's the other way around: maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie-boy, but he couldn't care less! sinatra plays his "cool" shtick much too often in his movies, and it is rarely credible. dean martin is kind of miscast; he isn't miscast as a card-player, but rather because of the accent which simply doesn't suit him. maclaine is charming as ever, but she plays a caricature - and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film. the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen-it-all-before movies and cheap novels; frankie is the "cool cat" who comes back to town to get all the women, and he couldn't care less about his writing (which, predictably, eventually garners recognition); martin is a sleazy but friendly card-player; maclaine is the dumb, but very likable bimbo; frankie's blond love-interest is a snotty literary expert; frankie's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife's business and has a lousy marriage; and so on. clichés.the story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far-fetched for my taste: frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time; and then there is the awful, stupid ending.in it, a drunk guy bent on killing frankie-boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places! the place is utterly crowded, with the typical noise and chaos - plus it's happening in the evening - and yet the guy somehow finds frankie (in spite of being drunk as a doorknob) and shoots at him. but guess who he kills? maclaine. she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie: a cliché which comic-book writers might cringe at. this utterly pathetic, over-dramatic, and annoying ending certainly cannot please any, even semi-intelligent, viewer. and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married! the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life - how else is the writing of this movie to be explained? there is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with frankie & martin vs. some cliché caricatures out of the writer's "vivid" imagination. (it was like a damn western suddenly.) another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty-nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine. as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him, just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low-class for her. there is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine. maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone, while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual; the ironic truth is that the latter's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual; her behaviour, comments, and opinions are mostly clichéd, silly, confused, pretentious, and primitive. at least maclaine's character knows that she (maclaine) is dumb. there is another irony that i didn't fail to notice: sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story - much like the writer of this movie, and that's why he came up with the corny, crappy finale.the film basically has a solid cast, and the photography is nice, but the script, though sometimes okay, relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality-based characters and events.if you're interested in reading my "biographies" of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.

[***possible spoilers***] this movie's reputation precedes it, so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in letterbox on tcm. what a major disappointment.the cast is superb and the production values are first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long. for a movie that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, unfaithfulness, gambling, and sexual repression, the movie is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliche-ridden. one example is the portrayal of frank hirsch's unfaithfuness: his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to "go upstairs and relax a bit" followed by her predictable pleading of a headache, leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary ("hey nancy, i've got the blues tonight. let's go for a drive"), all according to well-worn formula. we don't feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. also, the source of the obvious friction between frank and dave hirsch is never really explored or explained. dave's infatuation with the on-again/off-again gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot. his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley maclaine/ginny character is, from the moment of its being presented to this viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to fail, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed. the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who - dave or ginny - would get killed. the whole thing was phony with a capital 'p'. having said that, maclaine's performance and that of dean martin are the standouts here. but on the whole i find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history.

this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax. the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo dicaprio/tom hanks caper of the same name. the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi. yum! although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler. if he were a woman, they'd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler! (is is just me, or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall?) oh yeah, the plot--who cares? typical teen highjinx played by adults.

wow! i remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. they usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. as i watched this film i felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. however, then i find out that this film was made in 1989? say what! well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. the plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. in fact, the main character lives in a mansion. makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. oh, but here is the kicker. the school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. so the seniors go about doing this. hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a senior in? and why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out? and...ahh forget it, this film was stupid and made in 1989!?

the plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes. if you approach it as a car movie its not bad, lots of great cars in this one. the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed. i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st. cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since 89. its an interesting historical piece for us locals. seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs. had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. i didn't know the director was from st.cloud.

story of a good-for-nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music. director danny boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost, in this film, the edge for creating inspiring and funny films. strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv.

this utterly dull, senseless, pointless, spiritless, and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about danny boyle and his post-"trainspotting" movies: "the beach" already took care of that. what this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-delusion, bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising director's quick demise.the premise is absurd: two losers (ecclestone and some bimbo jenna g - a rapper, likely) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become. a friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in "action", and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage. now, i know that the uk in recent years has put out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; the music makes oasis seem like the beatles. during the studio recordings, the duo - strumpet - change lyrics in every take and ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they do take it. not only is the music total and utter trash, but its "performers" are anti-social; these newcomers are supposed to be calling the shots. it's just too dumb. it's plain awful.the dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere, and this rags-to-bitches story has no point and makes no sense. it often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. danny boyle is a complete idiot. this little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch. ecclestone's i.q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense. whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners.

way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up. oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these. 1: someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food, it was gross and unecessary. 2: there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track. either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both. many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. and don't even ask about the acting.

i've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about "teenagers seduce and kill man in his house" and such. i think i first saw parts of this film when i was about 10 years old when it was running on cable. it made quite an impression! it's the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching, and switch the channel when their parents come in. when i saw who the cast was, i couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. then again, if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered, then this is an interesting film. also, if i recall, there's some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. probably the dumbest ending of all time, but still...memorable.

there is a lot of talk of torture these days. that's all this movie is. it's about a good person who makes a bad decision. because of his kindness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. from then on its a just-for-kicks assault on him. i don't know at what point you do something about it. there is a wife and child out there somewhere; he has great feelings of guilt and fear. but there should have been some times when he could have acted. the movie seems to be somebody's joke. i suppose in the wake of the manson murders, we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two. nevertheless, why would someone make a film like this? what appeals does it have except for sadism. the conclusion is totally unsatisfying, but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist. oh, well. another hour and a half of my life.

this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (sandra locke & colleen camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning (seymour cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. but these two have other plans in mind, when they find out george's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up the george, killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it. either way some even consider this a cult classic.larry dodson

i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... it's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; i don't see where the terror comes into play here.... there are some "weird' and "surreal" sequences in the movie. and the two girls (sandra locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). the movie's not good, and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! i mean this thing is dripping with the 70's.... it's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang?

this is an atrocious movie. two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man. there's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a "spoiler". i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick. much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously, all the while grinning psychotically at the camera. add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again, including a vaudevillian song about "dear old dad" that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees. the music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen. the theme here is of youth run amok, understandable as a reaction to the '60s, but done with little imagination or style. avoid it!

so this guy named george is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up. george's wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away george gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls. it isn't that great of a scene because it really doesn't show anything. after that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house. they make him a nice breakfast but george isn't hungry. george isn't very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house. the girls have had enough with old george and no longer want to cook for them. they both turn out to be major psychopaths and use george in their little crazy game. i liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up george's house. george wasn't really that great to his two guests. when george said he was a married man, he really didn't seem to mean it. george looked like tom tucker on family guy. i was for the two girls the whole time.

a text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house, but i think the more apt word is "entropy." good grief, what slobs these two babes are!george (seymour cassell) is alone in his san francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in tiburon while his wife and child are away in san diego. two girls (sondra locke as jackson and colleen camp as donna) knock on his door, asking directions. well, it's raining, and they're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens, and they're not sure of the address they're looking for, and, what with one thing and another, george invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire. all three of them wind up in george's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure, and dodekakuple exposure. they spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast. but something has gotten slightly cockeyed because georgie's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and -- "you eat like animals!", george exclaims and tells them to get out. in his dreams. now, don't get me wrong. sondra locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt-blue eyes and colleen camp bounces around like a superball. you gotta say, they breed 'em mighty cute down there in shelbyville, tennessee, where locke comes from, and they breed 'em with bodacious tushes too, as we can't help but note after the first five or ten minutes.but when the girls go berserk, so does the movie. the film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light. the pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors. they brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure. they cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture. they have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another, licking food and then jumping each other's bones. and georgie? they first render georgie unconscious with mace (which contains nothing that you can't find in that little red bottle of mcilheny's tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet), tie him up, pour flour and milk all over him, subject him to a psychotic trial, put him through one of those tolstoy-type semi-executions, slap him around, dress up in outlandish costumes, then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper-middle-class home, and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina.as for the acting, it's as if someone had told georgie, "first act polite to these girls, then act panicked after you're tied up." and to the girls: "first act shy, unwilling to impose on anyone, then act crazy." and that's it. the photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie. i'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill. it takes effort and talent to turn san francisco ugly. the score gives us two leitmotivs. georgie's is some pop tune with lyrics about "being free" and "giving in." jackson and donna's is a catchy rinky-tink thing called "my good old dad." i approve of the moral lesson behind the story, though. there are some things you should simply not give in to, even though they might look like a lot of fun at first. all very educational.

i am a fan of the previous best of the best films. but this one was awful. no wonder i had such a hard time finding it. i tried 4 video rental stores, until i found one with a copy of this movie. the acting was terrible, the plot was a joke, and the action was bad as well.i really miss alex grady, travis brigley, and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies.john

believe it or not,this movie is worse than number three.it's slower,the acting is worse,and the story is very weak.there isn't a lot of good to say about this movie.even the fight scenes are more dull than number three,and i would have thought that impossible.this is a very slow 90 minutes.painful,in fact.i stuck it through,hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie,you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find(for purchase,that is)and probably for good reason.like number three,this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same in name only.anyway,the most i can give best of the best:without warning is 2/10

i don't think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm. he could act, got an oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper.happy go lovely is a case in point. it's a musical and for the most part you'll remember vera-ellen's dancing. you'll remember that they are in scot's costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival. but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.the plot is light. vera-ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh. she starts in the chorus and runs late one day. she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king. everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire. doors open up as they've never opened before.the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake. cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical.in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of.

it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen.not only have i ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. after the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. you hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again...

i think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are ok... but in whole it's a b movie. same about the plot, parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up. acting is mostly ok, i've seen worse of this too. :)the beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! cool!), like the drivers had never seen sand before... it gets slightly better from there, but not much.if you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm-up. keep expectations low and it might work for you.

this is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80's hit . it's set in the modern day as we see a base in afghanistan get destroyed by a uav right at the start.and that's exactly where the movie jumps the shark. uav's aren't armed. they could be but i don't think it's ever been tried for real. we get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation, called r.i.p.l.e.y. we are introduced to "hacker" will farmer (he's good at chemistry & electronics which doesn't make him a computer hacker) & his love interest, annie) & will's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his ip address is also logged and annie guessed who it was. we also meet wills mom who works for a chemical company.wills taking money from his neighbours bank account (mr massude) isn't a hack (he helped him set up the account), we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing global thermonuclear war & they play the dead code. the trace the ripley office are running is not on will but on massude's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against will.exactly why ripley shut will's machine down isn't explained (he's only playing an online game?) & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well. why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable. as for ripley activating his mobile phone? i think not, it wasn't connected to the pc and the message wouldn't play unless he actually answered the phone so there's more bad "hacking" science there too.ripley agents arrive at massude's home, take him away & will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money. will searching for the licence plate of the car that took massude isn't a "hack" as you never see him break into the dmv computer. the ripley agents who grab dennis in the airport as he's looking for will have no authority to arrest or detain him. will's mother hadn't "been stealing chemicals & bio agents" either. and even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain dennis. patriot act or not.i don't know why will was worried about being arrested for any crime in canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the us.the computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against will, his mother & dennis wasn't sanctioned by a government agency. the phone phreak we see will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie, we also get a hack into ripley which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.the "guy" who ran into annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with ripley & the laughable notion that ripley could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.another reference to the original movie when they mention stephen falken as the designer of the system ripley replaced, the joshua project. we discover that the "guy" who ran into annie is falken (not played by the original actor sadly) who faked his own death.we also get to see wopr as "what's going to help" them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then. falken & wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all (the same explosion should kill will, annie & the russian. it's also unlikely they'd create a self-contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.the whole "decontamination" plot & idea are totally unbelievable. those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff. so yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.the ip hacks against ripley aren't done by will, he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea. it's excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley's operating temperature. having joshua as a backdoor into ripley (especially after it had been blown to bits) is an incredible cop-out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown (saying 17 minutes) then ripley says "decontamination in 30 minutes", how crap is that when they can't even keep up with their own timer? ripley's attack mission against philadelphia is halted (far too easily in my opinion) and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed. the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she's doing won't work (surely she'd already know if she had joshua insider her as he'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie?) is yet another nod back to the original movie.their cop-out at having ripley repeat joshua's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.if you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat & rob kerchner. this is an awful movie and is best avoided.

some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and i understand where they're coming from, but i really have seen worse.that being said, the movies that i can recall (ie the ones i haven't blocked out) that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie. the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.war games: the dead code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close. yes i was a fan of the original, but no i wasn't expecting miracles from this one. let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.that's all i was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings. was that too much to ask for? is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even for a straight to video release? well apparently that was too much to ask for. stay away from this movie. at first it's just bad, like "oh yeah, this is bad, but i'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original." and then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie.

i can't say that wargames: the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i've ever seen. not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. there was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes. every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to "get into" the movie.i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie.

i see a lot of movies. saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. computers where still "a big mystery" for the most of us and the movie was convincing, in it's own way.this one, however, looks like a low budget wednesday night special. total crap, from start to finish.the plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie (which i would not recommend in the first place). i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie. but hey, with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting. lots of cliché scenes. cgi looks like it's taken out of the '86 version.bah, no, i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this. do not watch this movie.life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies.

it happened with assault on prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with the lost boys in 2008 and now it's happened with another classic from the 80's wargames... :( why, oh why, oh why won't hollywood ever learn? leave them alone...! they can't be remade...! they suck....! we all hate them....!.those of you who haven't seen the original 1983 version with matthew broderick & ally sheedy, go rent/buy it now....!! the hardware may look dated, the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down....for those of us who lived through the 80's when hacking was sexy, the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8" floppy variety, well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war! never before has "a nice game of chess" seemed the better option....

wow...this has got to be the dumbest movie i've ever seen. we watched it in english class...and this movie made absolutely no sense. i would never, ever watch this movie again...and my sympathy to those who have ever paid to see it.

certainly not horrible, but definitely not good.cry, the beloved country (1995) was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton). starring james earl jones and richard harris.the film is about pre-apartheid south africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo (james earl jones) receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. the rich farmer/landowner james jarvis (richard harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by kumalo's son. in this they connect.i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for i have not seen it. or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it; both look better than this one. but cry freedom, on the other hand, i have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry, the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going. very "wishy-washy". i refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.frankly, this movie blew. well, i guess it wasn't that bad, --five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, ronald harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime the pianist, and being julia). among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. the music doesn't help. the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. one upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.the last, striking words of alan paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. i don't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film.thanks for your time.

so, i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u. i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...the documentary section at the beginning dragged on. yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.seeing sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.when crispin glover takes on larry, the story-telling was better, but i just couldn't take anymore...

for the first time in years, i've felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review, because it was just such a let-down to watch. the plot sounded awesome when i read it, i expected a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. unfortunately, it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane, tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth-gnashingly stupid "no-one-says-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies"-dialogs that it's just agonizing.here's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film: - the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable. no, actually, it's angering. and lazy.- related to that: cheap thrills. a long parade "just in time" moments.- the main characters. alright, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life, but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies. thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clichés. they are mere plot-devices, place-holders without the slightest bit of personality. they are "man and woman in break-up who still love each other". never seen that one before except in 100,000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable. think of the blandest two-dimensional hollywood fare and you've got it. there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh, charming, or interesting.- the far-fetched, vague resolution that's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple, though the word "resolution" might be ill-fitting here, because the movie is a swampy mess that isn't going anywhere anyway. by the time you're through, though, you don't care anymore. the last third of the movie i just fast-forwarded, because it was just so unbearable to watch.okay, that's it. whatever redeeming features this movie has, it all gets buried under incompetence. don't watch this turd.

someone, some day, should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions, searches for secret passageways and crypts, trackings of monsters through air ducts, and so forth. offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout--"demon seed," "cube," the remake of "thirteen ghosts"--but it's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt; it's all about the character and the affect of spaces, passages, and walls. so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central. the idea is this: an architect has built--actually, rebuilt--for himself a huge and rambling house; his wife has just left him, mainly because of his own self-centeredness, but also, it is intimated, because she can't get used to the place since he remodeled it. living in unaccustomed solitude (real this time, rather than virtual), he comes to suspect that somebody else--a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared--is living into the house with him; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him.this is a good start for a melodrama, whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these: after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success, the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches, trying in various ways to surprise, intercept, or ambush the intruder, maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure. meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn't foresee or doesn't remember. the movie would turn into a cat-and-mouse game, a hunt, a battle; and finally, in trying to trap the intruder, the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation, in some way he didn't expect. then he would be forced to think himself out of it--and maybe at the same time out of his own self-imposed isolation--and in a final twist would nail, and maybe even kill, the ****er.nothing like this happens in this movie; the house is just a house, the architect is just a guy, and his nemesis is of an unknown character, if he exists at all. here is what does happen in the movie: once the intruder is installed in the house--if he is--the architect begins hearing noises, but when he goes to investigate finds nothing. he calls the police, they think he's slightly nuts; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night, she thinks he's more nuts. at last, more or less accidentally, he runs into the intruder (doesn't get a good look, but figures, who else could it be?--not a hard question, in a story with, to that point, fewer than three principal characters), whereupon he locks the doors, lowers the grills on the windows, throws away the key (i don't know why he thought this necessary), and leaves his victim to starve. i missed why this was a given: the doors and walls are made of steel? in any event, the architect takes to sleeping in his car. and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further, something else must be devised to take its place. and this is it: the architect--are you ready?--moves into the house of the man who (presumably) moved into his, and lives there in the same way. how is this possible? it is not, but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so: the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him; and while sitting in his car, he throws the picture into the street; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin, their neighbor; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way.if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible, what ensues plunges right in. the architect takes up residence with martin's wheelchair-ridden wife, unbeknownst to her; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around. throughout this section the movie is clever in one way, making (or leaving it to the viewer to make) the point that his life with this stranger, who doesn't know he's there, is in essence the same life he lived with his wife, as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer. but at the same time, his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat-burglar entirely incredible. not to go into the series of twists at the end--including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door--this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair; two nice people who take murder in stride; and (before the story started) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses.... to the final, long-anticipated twist, the movie adds another, to make it even more offensive, and then...ends.here is a story that depends on the development of two things--the idea of the stranger in the house, and the character of the man whose house it is--and fumbles both. the first fumble makes it boring; the second made me angry, as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path, and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one: martin the tunnel-builder and sneak-tenant. the story should be redone by someone, some day.

one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through, killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show, brain damage, and pulp fiction. designed primarily to offend, apparently, but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it.

not totally off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "killer tongue" is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi, horror, and supposed comedy. what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film. there is very little dialog, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete "pond scum". i wouldn't even call it strange, more like just "total nonsense". this movie is certain to disappoint, and you have been warned. there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish............................................................... merk

this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life. just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history, along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene. i think the transvestite poodles did it for me, or better yet, her talking tongue...or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat. decisions, decisions...

first of all let's start out by saying that robert englund doug bradley and melinda clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "son, i just watched the stupidest movie ever. i responded as saying "the killer tongue huh?" she was like how did you know that? that's how bad this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first freddy pinhead melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap. run away. far away. if you see it on the shelf at hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and walk away....and i still want my two hours back dang it

really bad movie. maybe the worst i've ever seen. alien invasion, a la the blob, without the acting. meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue. bad plot, bad fake tongue. absurd comedy worth missing. wash your hair or take out the trash.

impenetrable rubbish. this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the dialogue is ghastly, the horror effects are laughable. the only thing that kept me watching was the ever-splendid and totally underrated michael cule.

how did this become a blockbuster? dear god i don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much. the movie was predictable & there was no originality. the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters. the movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. this is 2006! people don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. most of the horror scenes we're taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies. total rip off! this is why i don't watch tagalog movies. the only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity. how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv, its now coming from the window next door? no matter how you put it, its still a rip off. if you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website.

i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. claudine barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that kris aquino's here. and... end.i really avoid watching pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was kind of scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away.. sayang.

mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made. there is no plot, just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits.the special effects look like they are from the '70's, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain awful.the only thing worse than the television show are the toys, just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids.there are far better shows for your kids to watch!try giving your kids something like nickelodean, those shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers.

i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all. the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time. there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers. this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world. from the notes, i can see that it's been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen, i can agree with their decision. avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.

come on, what is the deal with this show, power rangers anyways? i always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from japan in a better form, took what was great in japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever.the bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots, bulk and skull, to the "duhs", of the main cast, jason, trini, tommy, kimberly, billy and zack, i just want to say one thing: give me a break!saban brought this from japan, and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago.now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such.all i can say once again is give me a break!

okay, i seriously can't think of anything worse than the pr series. there are many bad things in life...traitors, liars, etc. but seriously, power rangers has got to be at the bottom of this list. can you think of anything more stupid than five-six teenagers (who don't even act like a normal teen) dancing around in identical suits with different colors so that you can tell them apart? fans, have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured? power rangers are for five-year old boys, and believe me, i never liked this show even when i was five.i guess you can say dino thunder is an exception. the teens actually act like teens, and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor, or no, a teacher. it's got teen-humor, though the fighting is lame, i don't hate dino thunder.many people say power rangers are crap, but i wouldn't. it would be an insult to crap. so face it, five year old boys, power rangers is rubbish.

nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then, and even as a child i didn't like it. even a 8-year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting, and how much the special-fx sucked even back then. when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. i don't know about you, but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. you never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.there is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (beetleborgs is a good example). all it is is just a quick way to make some money though. i challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. my guess is that most 'fans' of power rangers will tell me that i "just don't get it" anyway, or something along that line. i really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap now.

15 years ago, power rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially that of the youth. when i was a 3-year-old kid living in the philippines, i would watch this show every friday on abs-cbn (channel 2 over there). when the movie came out in 1995, it was all shock and awe to me when i watched it with my dad and 2 uncles. my grandparents even sent me a "balikbayan" box full of power rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the rangers). i even played the video games, and loved only one of them ("mmpr: fighting edition"), which was really sad. anyway, it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series (especially anime mech series like "gundam") now that i'm 18, i'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now. to prove this, i took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set dvd collection with "mmpr: the movie" and "turbo: a power rangers movie" and watched both of them. i was like, "ugh. how awful. just another junk in the attic for me." for all of you people of my generation, this is not a show that you'd want to watch over and over again. i'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally is not a bad thing now, is it? instead of "power rangers", i'd recommend something like "mobile fighter g gundam" (highly recommended), "ninja senshi tobikage" (aka ninja robots), or even the original sentai shows that were the basis of "power rangers."

power rangers, the completely awful kid's show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it's complete cheesiness, and awful settings.this show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences.the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such.i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was.as such, it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made.

mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993, supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s. now as a fan of japanese action films and series, you would think i would get a kick out of this show.you could not be more wrong. what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers.mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot.now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie, yet, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.it was followed by two really bad, and i do mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors starring in this series, completely disappeared from the scene.if you must choose, try watching japan's zyuranger series instead.also, what's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys? it makes them all look feminine!

i remember this show being on the television when i was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs. it was called power rangers. i remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.i never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like the tick were playing on fox kids. most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. the footage is ridiculous at best. the colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. all the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.the toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. and of course two of the worst movies ever made, and i do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising. as an adult, i don't look at it fondly, but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows, fashion and guys' earrings.

many people here say that this show is for kids only. hm, when i was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) i watched this show first. it was disgusting for me. i talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? this was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on tv or anything else) we said "uh, just like power rangers" and laughed. and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr. it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. i did not enjoy that viewing. but it dawned upon me: maybe i have not enough imagination? it may be. however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star.

the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united states.there is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show.this is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous.the owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense.kids of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage.

power rangers, the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s, has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created.what exactly is the point of this show anyway, other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children? there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway.look at the costumes, which look like spandex gone bad.the mullet style hair, earrings, and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days.avoid this show at all costs!

this movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you still had to continue to watch. my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day. now don't get me wrong, the acting is good. just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us. there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario. after this movie, i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter. jennifer tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. her character seems manic and not all there. darryl hannah, though over played, she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent. all in all, very violent movie...not for the faint of heart.

wow...sheer brilliance.turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.after watching this, i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog, messed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development overall, then this is the one to watch.be sure to keep focused for the classic "food processor" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid, daring or brave.

this movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind. firstly, how has jennifer tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs? secondly... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of? and thirdly... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this, shouldn't there have been someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released. you really would have to search a very, very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this... and it isn't even billed as a horror movie - which, inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre, it certainly is. the movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all. i'm not actually advocating censorship (which i don't believe in)... but i really can't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this.

i have read the other comment about this movie, and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person. however, this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen (and thats topping a lot of bad usa network plus cinemax nights.) whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one. this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever. i really think these people are insane. just save your time and do not watch this fllm. please - i wish that i had. the acting is horrible, the plot (what plot) is stupid and degrading and insane. i really do not think this should have been made into a movie. but that is my opinion, and i am trying to save you from wasting your time.

i'm glad some people liked this, but i hated this film. it had a very good idea for a story line, but that's where it ended. it was badly written, badly acted and badly made. it had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped over too fast, the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits, like lying about why she was kidnapped, and ditch the dross. instead it was "what's going on?", 5 seconds later they tell you.this film had no suspense, and i was bored from start to end. i just wanted it to finish. go and rent misery, or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end.

not being familiar with us television stations, when i flicked onto this on my in-laws' cable, first i thought it was just a low-budget sci-fi film, then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of christian fundamentalist, and then it dawned on me - good grief, these people are serious! it's been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious. i hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers, but then i saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. tough philosophical conundrum: how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you're criticizing? answer: make it in such a way that the only people who'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're criticizing. i suppose some liberals (ugh! spit when you say that!) might be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the j**** c***** myth, but i didn't mind - it was so darn funny!

this movie seems to send the wrong message. there can be morality without using christ. poeple of other religions, i believe, can get into heaven. i am a catholic who goes to church every week, but i do not agree with such christian arrogance. this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen timeline.

i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke!there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens.i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by "reefer madness." that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach "christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world.it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century!

first of all, this movie reminded me of the old movies i used to have to watch in religion class in school. that's not a good thing. basically, it's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth, just like the terrible "left behind" series. i'm not offended by religious movies... but i am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful. i would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it doesn't look like that will happen any time soon. i bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget, they still wouldn't be able to come up with anything good. just avoid this one. also, the fact that the "american family association" (basically, reverend wildmon's lackies) beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it. in fact, after i viewed this, i went home and watched my copy of david cronenberg's nc-17 rated "crash". forgive me father for i have sinned. hahahahaha!

when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like the garden of allah. how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.the garden of allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. it then got two silent screen adaptions. the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world. he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer. i'm not sure what was in david o. selznick's mind in filming this story. someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title. the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret. the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves. the monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. most especially marlene dietrich. i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.

this picture seemed way to slanted, it's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in iraq. it paints a picture so unredeemable that i can't help but wonder about it's legitimacy and bias. also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for ptsd. to me the subject matter seemed confused, it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light, as a) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and b) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the v.a. this is a legitimate argument, but felt off topic for me, almost like a movie in and of itself. i felt that "the war tapes" and "blood of my brother" were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint. f-

'dead letter office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented. what's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living. granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed. it's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince. overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else.

this movie had a imdb rating of 8.1 so i expected much more from it. it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. but before the movie is half-way through, it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable. the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people at all. this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. the thing is, i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so stale!the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office. hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon.

you know all those letters to "father christmas" and "jesus" that are sent every year? well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. as bizarre settings go, it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is "dead letter office". having said that, this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one. if it was royal mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. i haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a mr wang, some female priest of the church of latter day i've-never-heard-of-you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company."dead letter office" (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of alice (miranda otto) who grows up in a seriously divided home. writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another. so, logically, she gets a job at the d.l.o. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez (george del hoyo). slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the dead letters office to its knees?nothing against this film but i was reminded of the god-awful heather graham film "committed" while watching this. however, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that ain't difficult. for a start, this film is much more logical. true, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. it is also well acted. both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. the other part is that when you consider australia's draconian immigration policy (i.e. if you don't speak english, rack off!), such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. the other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.despite that, "dead letter office" is certainly something a little different. it might not be to everyone's taste but i liked it. yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an australian film). there ain't any major laughs, there's no bullet time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. but it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence, it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time. it's the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there.

this movie offers nothing to anyone. it doesn't succeed on any level. the acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. complete garbage, i can't believe what a laughable movie this was. and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing nc-17 movie. the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens. pathetic.

okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not. before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time. so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: the beginning started off fine for me. it seemed to be heading in a decent direction. got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point. then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on. there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that. it had about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward. then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull. oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job. okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya's attention. thats where it got disturbing. i didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it. i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so...i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up. but if you choose to watch it just don't be unsuprised.

do not waste your time or your money on this movie. my roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called descent (the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyways thinking it couldn't be that bad. it was. i can't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public. it was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just can't make yourself. i honestly feel emotionally scarred. it went from being a semi-low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she's dating to an all out porno flick. and really not a good one. i went from hating the woman's rapist to almost feeling bad for him. almost. all in all, an awful movie that was definitely rated nc-17 for a reason. don't waste your money. and don't let your kids watch it.

if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant. instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. she in essence nullifies the judicial system. the film "the accused" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. what the "descent" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? is victim any better that the accuser? no!!!

this movie was disgusting. their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage. what is garbage? the misuse of peoples time, the misuse of energy, and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write. talia you are a sick demented loser. your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem. the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage. i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for. if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie. i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie "no more support from me." how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene. i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is; congratulations you won his attention.

as i write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake culture. movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'king kong, 'the wicker man' and practically every film that ever starred michael caine. this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, however, as 'dough for the do-do' proves. an entirely pointless colorized version of bob clampett's surreal masterpiece 'porky in wackyland', 'dough for the do-do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by friz freleng. freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with clampett's source material, although in truth no director could hope to come close to clampett's inspired insanity. inevitably, then, 'dough for the do-do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached. for cartoon fans like myself, its equivalent to a colorization of 'casablanca'.

"dutch schultz", aka arthur fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented. this movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character, because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology. not only that, it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate n.y. and his religious conversion. it is true that he was executed by luciano, lansky, et. al. but that's as far as it goes. the exploding plate scene which represents luciano carrying out the execution of bo weinberg in his own home, assisted by his own mother is rediculous. also, there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond. it just doesn't work. the character of mrs. fleggenheimer doesn't work either. this movie does not need a doting jewish mother for comic relief. the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough. i'm sure the man is turning in his grave. and, by the way, dutch did in fact personally kill people, but, he was not rambo or 007. the scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd. i don't know. maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just didn't get it.

this was on the 30th anniversary dvd for blazing saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. nowhere did i see mel brook's name on here and i can guess why, he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. my gawd, who would find this funny. sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny, well cause it's simply not funny. it's like the writers didn't even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles. did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? flat out, they didn't care. it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. i guess it's useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be.

i just watched the 30th anniversary edition of blazing saddles, one of my all time favorites!! the tv pilot for black bart stunk. the plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. it was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of blazing saddles and there have been tv shows that have succeeded in doing take-offs of big movies, but this one would never have worked. considering that for so many years tv would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie, it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on tv with the "n" word thrown around. on the other hand, i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces!!! there were quite a few actors/actresses that i recognized from other shows over the years. i had to write down all the names and do a few searches. that was fun. i was arguing with my mother if steve landesberg was from barney miller or mash. i won! :)

this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th annivesery dvd special edition "blazing saddles". imagine the movie without the satire, humor, or writing skills. but with all the trappings of a typical lame '70's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was. what the hell was lou gossett jr. thinking when he signed onto this disaster?? this was possibly the worst thing he's been in (and yes i'm including the first "punisher" movie and "iron eagles 3". steve landesberg, i understand as he can't say no to crap.my grade: f

to review this movie, i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's "pulp fiction" (1994) when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living. jules tells vincent that the "only thing she did worthwhile was pilot". vincent asks "what the hell is a pilot?" and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is: "well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. that show's called a 'pilot'. then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. some pilots get picked and become television programs. some don't, become nothing. she starred in one of the ones that became nothing." now to stretch on what jules was talking about, there are billions of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not...well, good. probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is "w*a*l*t*e*r", a spin-off to "m*a*s*h" with gary "radar" burghoff as the lead. hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? hence, the show was never picked up. what many people don't know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide. some have made they're way past and got onto the air (the pilot for the animated series "american dad" comes to mind, as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later. however, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why."black bart", a supposed tie-in with the mel brooks comedy classic, "blazing saddles", is a stale and bland "sitcom" with little heart and no soul. "saddles" was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind "what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv?!?" i say "supposed", because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from bart, on in this mess of a tv show. mel brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (in a related story, i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie "clerks." that kevin smith was no involved in....you see what happens?!?).set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately 'black' bart, who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr., obviously before his stint in "real" acting, whereas in this he is playing a "g-rated" richard pryor. most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: jim, the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan, a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun. lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich-type accent and personality. while that's pretty much the end in similarities, the lead "bad guy" in the story is fern malaga, played by noble willingham, who i assumed would've been hedley lamar if warner bros. secured the rights to the name (see trivia for "blazing saddles") and his son curley...i dunno, taggart i suppose? the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot. bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin. really, it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the "series" and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an "alright" show. i can't really call it a sitcom (and even if i wanted to) and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros. studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like "m*a*s*h" (complete with a bland and dull "laughing" that is identical to the series). the acting is so-so, but there's one part that always make me laugh, and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue. ha! the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (surprisingly, they use the word "n***er" numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it's time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive.if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss...surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (it's on the collector's edition of "blazing saddles", god knows why). there, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air.

watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. even when you thought, "that mackerel surely can't be coming around again," *slap* there it was. i'm not sure what they were thinking. this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered, "did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series?" not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well. and while "blazing saddles" made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness, these stereotypes were just downright offensive. there was no plot line, the ending was slapped on, and the jokes aren't. still, if you are a student of comedy, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.

i'm going to write about this movie and about "irreversible" (the (in)famous scene in it). so you are warned, if you haven't seen the movie yet. this are just my thoughts, why i think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).acting wise, rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). the villain guy is good, but loses his "evil" touch right before the end. if he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? he wouldn't, period. then we also have the bartender/2nd rape dude. actually i don't think you would need him. at least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.let's reprise the story. rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). this wasn't intentional, as rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. rosario's character meets a guy, who is a sexual predator, in all the bad senses. but he makes an impression on her.rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. i beg to differ. because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. talking about her mother, here's another problem. after the first rape takes place, rosarios character doesn't tell anyone what happened. seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. if rosarios character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. there was so much potential here. also her female friend: we see her at the party, it's obvious there is something going on and "boom" she is gone.the first rape is almost unbearable to watch. but feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape), which feels like you're getting hit with a sledge hammer! after rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...), but left in the open. no real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. it's apparent that he isn't a "nice" guy and his character get's fleshed out a bit. but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. we get the point that rosarios character isn't the same anymore, that she went "bad" and is able to hurt people. (too) many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. back to rapist #1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). as absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl (very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately) and his football career. well career is a stretch and he is bullied. this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too cliché to stay with you. so rapist #1 submits to rosarios character ... why exactly? because he promised her, it was her day? again, really? a guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. another possibility would have a drug in his drink.so rapist #1 undresses and get's blindfolded and let's rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that's just crazy! but what comes next, is even crazier. first she talks to him, then she "shuts" him up and forces an object into him. this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. this isn't about what this guy deserves or not, it's just intense. and of course that was what they were aiming for. now after she is "done" the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. if this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the "revenge". having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.this isn't supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable, it's a hard watch & it is art-house. but the 10 minute (i didn't count ) rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. which brings me to the biggest disappointment.irreversible comparison: "irreversible" had the rape scene, but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. first, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. and secondly and most importantly, this is where the art-house movie should've come in. it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. but then again, she didn't actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...good intentions (talia and rosario had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesn't work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...

a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks' blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is!the laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!however, it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr. trying his best to impersonate cleavon little. his embarrassment shows through in every scene. he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse!

"black angel" is minor whodunit, with june vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. dan duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help vincent find the real culprit. peter lorre has one thankless role as a suspect. this film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special. it is pleasant enough but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big "give me a break" reactions. that ending alone could have sank the film completely, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. vincent is a wimpy heroine and duryea was never very good at playing good guys. i love film noirs, but this one was a real disappointment.

dan duryea, a perfectly decent b-movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s, can't do much with this one: young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; when he's sentenced to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband. after a dazzling opening shot, flick quickly settles into b-movie formula. it certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast (including peter lorre and broderick crawford) is just a bit stiff. based on a cornell woolrich novel, and passable for a single viewing. ** from ****

it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes. apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny. his skull-like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake, but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow. not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch, but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing. not only that, but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap. so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester. whatever the cap was made of, it looked very new and artificial. jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits, but brett did not have to dress-up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part. frewer on the other hand is painful to watch. even in the full "holmes" outfit, he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes.frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad "upper-crust" british accent is painful to see and listen to. to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement. after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum, he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait. when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone, the jack russell terrier. i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone. but sadly, there is no dog in this movie except for frewer. wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.not only does frewer's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking (in that awfully artificial british nasal accent), but he is much to friendly and kind. frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to, and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth. perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production, they are trying to make a children's version of sherlock holmes (wishbone was better at that, too) that was kindler and gentler. whatever the point of frewer's interpretation of sherlock holmes, it is flatter than a pancake, and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen (including the previous worst, by charlton heston).overall, the tone of this film is awful. it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder. all the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed. holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie. even on murder she wrote there is less exposition.this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo. the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer. it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes, especially the bbc version with jeremy brett. this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie. the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity. walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer, and when he is often interviewing witnesses, his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible. unfortunately, the rest of the cast is amateurish, and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other (to show they are suspicious) is something that i had not seen in any modern movie.

as a casual listener of the rolling stones, i thought this might be interesting. not so, as this film is very 'of its age', in the 1960's. to me (someone born in the 1980's) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but i am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th '60's. i expected drugs galore with th stones, i was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. i have not seen any of the directors other films, but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it, it came free with a sunday paper.

it utterly defeats me why godard is taken so seriously - and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. it's hard to credit that godard actually believed all that marxist and maoist kant. anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as godard was making his films supporting them. as a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience, and then, when you couldn't think of anything else to do, layer another voice-over to the first voice-over, which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? brilliant, jean-luc! as for godard insisting on making a film with the rolling stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? it was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. the bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre, and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. ironic that godard's one-time great friend, truffaut, with nuit americain, made the best film about film-making ever, and godard made the worst with le mepris! incidentally, godard didn't choose the stones' track of sympathy with the devil. it just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at barnes olympic studios.

this movie sucked plain and simple. okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. the rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.3.2/10

rosario dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. while its clear why dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, dawson seems out of place in the role. forgive me i simply couldn't find her. thats not a mistake, thats how i felt, i had no idea where she was. yes i know she's on the screen but even though i spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. i blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. the people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which i would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of rosario dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.what can i say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time i can't get back. for rosario dawson fans only, though be warned there's several real reasons why this is nc17. (and rosario- please, you're a better actress, pick better scripts)

revenge is one of my favorite themes in film. moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film. having seen gaspar noe's irreversible (2002), i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus.*spoilers* the end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. however, the film doesn't even follow through with this. instead, the drawn out scene (which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "this didn't fix anything" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.my problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. i mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? do we rejoice in dawson's revenge? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? do we feel dawson's moment of regretful clarity? aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance. character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc.normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent didn't really seem to know what those were. thumbs down.

having just recently re-viewed "lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, i backed it with "descent" even though i have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.it's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the rape revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of "i spit on your grave," to the tawdry sensationalism of "lipstick," to the tasteful handling of the issue in "the accused." but "descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. no, "descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn't that groundbreaking.i pretty much knew the plot going in. what i wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of dawson's character. being a big fan of rosario's, i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal deniro brings to "taxi driver." unfortunately, the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.the biggest point of failure is the second act. it became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a q&a on the dvd, but this excursion into dawson's character is never believably rendered. we don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after, or why she's doing it. the poor quality of the audio/video again don't help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. by the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. while that's certainly valid, it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.if you have the dvd, check out the deleted "classroom" scene. this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really does show dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift's prissy, condescending dorm counselor. if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.as the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. so what?

it's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself. the paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the movie page has details i could not glean from watching the actual movie. i found myself constantly backing it up to see what details i had just missed which could tell me what the (bleep) was going on. alas, to no avail--this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story, if you could call it a story. it's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations. newsflash to the the creators: i paid to watch you make a movie. i can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free. and rosario dawson? this is somebody i've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face, and i can see why. she had one of the most artificial performances i have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, a or b. i figured okay, maybe she didn't really want the role, just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into? wrong. she was listed as one of the producers. next time you produce something, don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act. if you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. also, somebody here mentioned the white/latino issue--yes, i hate to say it, but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats. that's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters. the adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story's antagonist. as for the maya character, she didn't seem like a real person. anyway i'm ashamed for hollywood that this movie was even made.

i saw 'descent' last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment. disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, i'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's, i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. my conclusion: let's stick to the classics! yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. even dawson is empty. some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the us, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. just like the scene where dawson gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! i wasn't expecting anything 'irreversible'-style but still, aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? i didn't. not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) and i read that the photography was impressive. well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either. i must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie, i couldn't help thinking 'i feel like watching argento's 'inferno' again. lol. more seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the american-canadian border in lynch's 'twin peaks - fire walk with me'... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere... no, i just couldn't get into this movie. too bad.
